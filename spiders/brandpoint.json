            "body": "Due to the pandemic, some parents have delayed doctor visits and immunizations for their babies. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported fewer children and infants having recommended vaccinations during the spring 2020 lockdowns, leaving those children at higher risk of getting diseases like the measles.While it’s understandable that parents are worried about taking children to the doctor now, babies and toddlers need to see a healthcare provider for wellness visits while their bodies are growing and developing. Eight well-child visits are recommended between birth and 15 months. If you have a little one, remember these regular in-person wellness visits — and vaccinations — help make sure your baby stays healthy.If you're behind on visits and immunizations, don’t worry — simply call your pediatrician to schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Rest assured that your baby’s healthcare provider is taking all necessary steps to keep you and your child healthy during your visit.“Healthcare providers nationwide are doing everything they can to safeguard the health of patients and families,” says Dr. Arethusa Kirk, chief medical officer at UnitedHealthcare. 'Think of your baby's pediatrician as your partner in helping to keep your baby safe and healthy, because that's their primary goal.'Here are the main reasons for keeping your baby’s regular wellness visits.1. Your pediatrician can identify concernsSeeing your baby helps a pediatrician identify signs of illness or developmental concerns. Recognizing issues early helps your pediatrician give your child prompt treatment to keep them healthy.2. Your infant needs immunizationsThe CDC recommends vaccinations proven to help protect children against dangerous diseases like polio and measles. These vaccinations must be given early to protect babies when they are most vulnerable.All vaccinations have been proven by extensive research to be safe and effective for your child. According to Johns Hopkins University, most childhood immunizations work for 85%-95% of people who get them. But some vaccinations, like the two required doses of MMR (Measles-Mumps-Rubella) have been proven to offer up to 99% protection from those diseases.Schools and daycares require children to be immunized to protect all enrolled children. Not vaccinating your child leaves them at risk of getting serious, possibly life-threatening illnesses.Vaccinations are designed to protect from and reduce the effect of illnesses like the flu if contracted. Making sure your whole family is protected with up-to-date immunizations creates a circle of protection around vulnerable newborns and developing babies. 3. You can ask questions Face it, parenting is hard. New parents especially have many questions arise about their child’s development and behavior.Here are common questions your pediatrician can answer:4. Pediatricians can provide resourcesIf your family needs help finding childcare, getting a car seat or food assistance, babyproofing your house or with any other concerns, your pediatrician can assist you in finding helpful programs and resources.5. Well-child visits are usually covered by insuranceMost insurance plans will cover early well-child visits and immunizations, so they may be free of charge. Call your health insurance provider to ask about your family’s coverage.If you are a UnitedHealthcare Community Plan member, you may have access to the Healthy First Steps program, which can help you find a care provider, schedule well-child visits, connect with educational and community resources and more. (Healthy First Steps is only available to members in some states. For all other states, contact the number on your insurance card for assistance.) Call 1-800-599-5985, TTY 711, Monday-Friday 8 a.m.-5 p.m. For help getting to appointments, getting formula or healthy food, call the number on your insurance card.Prepare for your visitWrite down questions to ask the pediatrician and bring them with you, along with anything your baby might need (like diapers, wipes, a bottle).Call your healthcare provider to ask about their safety guidelines. Always practice social distancing, wash hands often and wear a mask to protect your family and others during COVID-19.To learn more about wellness visits, visit www.uhc.com/childrenswellness."

            "body": "Whether you’re an avid or casual PC gamer, chances are you could improve your gameplay set-up. Most people develop their gaming station gradually, over time. The result? A hodgepodge of equipment and furniture that often falls short. The more you play, the more you may notice your set-up isn’t ideal — and could be throwing you off your game.Champion gamer and Evil Geniuses team member Tarik “Tarik” Celik offers his top tips for improving your gaming environment, and he should know: Tarik is a champion Counter-Strike player most recently winning ESL One: NY 2019.His advice? Start with the basics, like comfort, and go from there to play your best.1. LocationWhere do you play? If your setup is far from your wireless router, or if walls and furniture stand in the way, you could have connectivity problems. You don’t want internet speed or unreliability to disrupt your game play. If you can't change your location, the best solution is to create a hardwired connection as an easy fix. If you are forced to play wireless, try to reduce the distance and obstacles between your router.2. Sit comfortablyIf you’ve ever gotten up from gaming with a sore back or neck, your chair could be the culprit. Investing in a comfortable chair can prevent pain and help you focus.Since you may not know how comfortable a chair is until you’ve given it a fair trial, buy from a company with a generous return policy.3. Choose the best PCWhether you're new to gaming or upgrading, you'll want a gaming PC with the best processor to handle high-end games, plus a dedicated graphics card that will deliver a smoother frame rate and less lag. To avoid overheating, you'll also need a PC with a cooling system.4. It’s all about the visuals and settingsUpgrading to a top-of-the-line monitor takes your gaming experience to the next level. LG Electronics’ new UltraGear 27GN950 monitor with 4K Nano IPS 1ms Display is recommended by Tarik of Evil Geniuses for gamers who want to play multiple titles (including multiplayer and single player games).“When you compete at the top level, gear is very important. If you are not playing on the best gear possible, then you are going to be at a disadvantage,” says Tarik. “Something really special about this LG monitor is that it is the world’s first 4K resolution IPS gaming monitors with a 1ms response rate and it really does set it a head of the curve.”“Monitors are extremely important for being able to play at your best. Apart from your computer, the monitor is the main component for your gameplay and you want to make sure that your visuals look good, your refresh rate is good and everything is smooth on your screen,” adds Tarik. “Another thing I like about this LG monitor is that it is virtually borderless. It makes it look really sleek and keeps the distractions away so you can focus on your game.”LG UltraGear provides the most immersive and competitive PC gaming experience, so your flow is never interrupted.5. Sound also mattersWhile gaming may be primarily visual, a high-quality headset brings sound to the next level. Beyond excellent sound quality, consider:6. Bells and whistlesWhen choosing the best gear, details affect both comfort and appearance.Check out all the possibilities for state-of-the-art gaming technology at LG.com.LG Electronics’ new UltraGear 27GN950 monitor offers a 144HZhigh-speed refresh rate, along with a 1ms response rate. What does that mean? You’ll enjoy smoother, clearer action without tearing, blurring or ghosting for a seamless gaming experience. Plus its crisp, vivid colors and sharp details will let you fully immerse yourself in the game play, thanks to the 4K Nano IPS Display and VESA Display Stream Compression (DSC) Technology. Another bonus? You can raise, lower, tilt and pivot the monitor stand any way you want — in case you haven’t found the perfect chair yet."

Whether you’ve headed back into the classroom or you're continuing to learn remotely, this year presents new challenges for everyone. Amid all these changes, it's easy to get so busy that you don’t take good care of yourself. The result? When you’re over-stressed and under-nourished, it shows on your skin.Why not start the school year off right by establishing good self-care habits? When you’re in the middle of midterms or working on a giant project, you’ll thank yourself for setting up a routine that keeps you looking and feeling your best, inside and out.Follow these tips to start a self-care routine to help you be your best self.Rest upSleep is often the first thing to go when deadlines are looming, but don’t start the semester skimping on your beauty rest. Set a reasonable time to go to bed and wake-up time and stick to it — even on weekends — as much as you can.Being sleep deprived not only leads to dark circles under your eyes, but it also makes it hard to focus on your studies. Late night? Let yourself take a short power nap in the afternoon if you need one.Start cleanA refreshing way to start your morning is through your skincare routine. Clean &amp; Clear® Deep Action Exfoliating Scrub invigorates skin and cleanses deep down into your pores, working to dissolve dirt and oil while exfoliating surface skin. This gentle scrub can be used daily, and along with its cooling sensation, will leave your skin looking and feeling revitalized.You may not even need that second cup of coffee to feel awake.Give yourself time to de-stress Whether it’s first thing in the morning, midday or later in the evening, allow yourself at least 15 minutes every day to do whatever helps you feel centered and relaxed:Make this break a regular part of your day. You’ll find yourself looking forward to it, and your skin will show fewer signs of stress and worry.Pack self-care essentialsWherever you spend your day, make sure you have what you need for you and your skin to look and feel good. What should be on your list?Then, to help your skin stay fresh, stash a pack of Clean &amp; Clear® Oil Absorbing Sheets in your backpack or purse. They soak up excess oil and shine from your face without smudging your makeup or leaving residue on your skin. These silky smooth sheets can be used around your nose, forehead and other oily areas of your face. They even change color so you can see them working.Feed your skinColorful fruits and veggies contain vitamins that are good for your skin: A, C, D, E and K. Think berries, apricots, tomatoes, carrots and leafy greens. Healthy fats from food like avocados, salmon and other fatty fish, nuts and seeds also help give your skin that healthy glow.Don't get enough of these healthy foods every day? Look for a multivitamin supplement to boost your vitamin intake.Have some funAllow yourself time to do something fun each week. Exploring hobbies, doing exercise you enjoy, getting out in nature — whatever makes you smile, de-stress and feel happy will also help you look great.Back-to-school time doesn't have to mean locking yourself inside with your books 24/7. Being a well-rounded person helps you focus better when you need to, and makes the hard work easier to handle. The upside? When you feel good, your skin will look good, too."

            "body": "Due to the coronavirus’ impact on our daily routines, we’re juggling more than ever. From complex school schedules, to working and living in the same place — it can be difficult to control what’s on our plates.In this environment, small steps to improve safety and get organized will make a world of difference. As you navigate school carpools and working remote, consider these recommendations to master the days ahead.Use Sunday to map out your week’s meals and wardrobeFrom meal prep to outfit prep, taking time at the beginning of the week to plan Monday-Friday will give you time back. To stay organized, consider purchasing five different color stickers, each to represent one day of the week. After making five days’ worth of lunches or hanging up outfits, stick on the designated sticker.Take steps to implement long-lasting safetyFor confidence and control on the road, upgrade your most critical piece of safety equipment — your tires. According to a recent study by Michelin, 70% of parents are opting to drive their kids to school instead of having them take the bus. Additionally, 39% of parents are practicing more car maintenance, knowing they’ll be on the roads more.To elevate your vehicle’s safety and performance in any weather, consider the new Michelin CrossClimate 2. This tire stops shorter in dry and wet conditions than competitors and lasts up to 15,000 miles longer. For most drivers, that’s an additional year of use — whether at the school drop-off line or racing to extracurriculars.Utilize cleaning hacks to save timeInstead of a cumbersome cleaning session once a week, clean the house little by little. In fact, you can use products you have lying around the house in unique ways to limit additional trips to the store. For instance, polish chrome and stainless steel fixtures with shaving cream, as recommended in a recent article on apartmenttherapy.com, or use bleach pens to easily remove dirt from grout. By cleaning daily a small amount, you’ll save time and live in a cleaner, healthier home.Don’t forget to take care of yourselfWith many parents and caregivers taking on more roles and responsibilities, it is important that they take time for themselves. It can appear to be contradictory; however, technology can help with disconnecting quickly and easily. Take a walk while listening to a favorite podcast, use FaceTime to “see” a friend or download a mindfulness app, which can help your brain stay focused and help diffuse stress. Whether it’s time you can squeeze in-between daily tasks or an extra hour you take before the rest of the house wakes up, hold yourself accountable to these virtual self-appointments by adding them to your calendar."

            "html": "<p>Due to the coronavirus’ impact on our daily routines, we’re juggling more than ever. From complex school schedules, to working and living in the same place — it can be difficult to control what’s on our plates.</p><p>In this environment, small steps to improve safety and get organized will make a world of difference. As you navigate school carpools and working remote, consider these recommendations to master the days ahead.</p><p><strong>Use Sunday to map out your week’s meals and wardrobe</strong></p><p>From meal prep to outfit prep, taking time at the beginning of the week to plan Monday-Friday will give you time back. To stay organized, consider purchasing five different color stickers, each to represent one day of the week. After making five days’ worth of lunches or hanging up outfits, stick on the designated sticker.</p><p><strong>Take steps to implement long-lasting safety</strong></p><p>For confidence and control on the road, upgrade your most critical piece of safety equipment — your tires. According to a recent study by <a href=\"https://www.michelinman.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Michelin</a>, 70% of parents are opting to drive their kids to school instead of having them take the bus. Additionally, 39% of parents are practicing more car maintenance, knowing they’ll be on the roads more.</p><p>To elevate your vehicle’s safety and performance in any weather, consider the new <a href=\"https://www.michelinman.com/tires/all-season-tires/cross-climate/crossclimate2.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Michelin CrossClimate 2</a>. This tire stops shorter in dry and wet conditions than competitors and lasts up to 15,000 miles longer. For most drivers, that’s an additional year of use — whether at the school drop-off line or racing to extracurriculars.</p><p><strong>Utilize cleaning hacks to save time</strong></p><p>Instead of a cumbersome cleaning session once a week, clean the house little by little. In fact, you can use products you have lying around the house in unique ways to limit additional trips to the store. For instance, polish chrome and stainless steel fixtures with shaving cream, as recommended in a recent article on apartmenttherapy.com, or use bleach pens to easily remove dirt from grout. By cleaning daily a small amount, you’ll save time and live in a cleaner, healthier home.</p><p><strong>Don’t forget to take care of yourself</strong></p><p>With many parents and caregivers taking on more roles and responsibilities, it is important that they take time for themselves. It can appear to be contradictory; however, technology can help with disconnecting quickly and easily. Take a walk while listening to a favorite podcast, use FaceTime to “see” a friend or download a mindfulness app, which can help your brain stay focused and help diffuse stress. Whether it’s time you can squeeze in-between daily tasks or an extra hour you take before the rest of the house wakes up, hold yourself accountable to these virtual self-appointments by adding them to your calendar.</p>",

            "body": "Bad driving habits aren’t just obnoxious, they’re also dangerous — motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of death in the U.S., with more than 38,000 people having lost their lives and nearly 4.4 million injured in collisions in 2019, according to the National Safety Council.“Many car collisions are entirely preventable,” said Kevin Quinn, vice president of claims and customer experience at Mercury Insurance. “The simple solution is for drivers to be responsible, obey traffic laws and stay focused on the road. Don't play with your phone while you're driving, don't speed and don't drink and drive. And if you practice these things regularly and keep your driving record free of accidents and traffic violations, it could lower auto insurance rates.”Quinn recommends the following four tips to stay safe behind the wheel.1. Remove distractions. Most crashes are caused by distracted drivers. Driver distractions extend beyond texting — anything that takes your attention away from the road is a distraction. While you should put your phone away when behind the wheel, some driving tech can actually help improve your driving habits, such as a usage-based insurance program that comes with a virtual coach to let you know how you can improve behind the wheel.2. Maintain proper following distance. Following a car too closely reduces the time you have to react if the car you are following suddenly slows or stops. This can lead to a rear-end collision, which is the most common auto insurance claim, according to Mercury Insurance. Make sure you give yourself enough time and distance to react to the car in front of you. You should always maintain at least three seconds of space in between your vehicle and the car in front of you — and during bad weather conditions, five seconds of space is recommended.3. Be aware of your speed. Speeding is one of the most common causes of traffic-related deaths, so pay attention and stick to posted speed limits — they’re there to keep you safe. Give yourself some extra time for your drive so there’s no need to rush and be sure to exercise extra caution while driving in bad weather.4. Pay attention to other drivers. Safe driving isn't just about your behavior, but also depends on those around you. Don’t assume other drivers are being attentive — they may be distracted and not see the stop sign or traffic light ahead of them. Use caution when entering and exiting parking spots, turning, entering intersections and changing lanes on the freeway, especially if you’re driving in heavy traffic or late at night when other drivers may let their focus wander.“Drivers may also want to consider enrolling in a usage-based insurance program to help improve their driving skills,” adds Quinn. “These apps and devices allow drivers to get a crystal-clear view of their behavior and see which areas need some improvement. Plus, auto insurance customers who enroll in these programs may even qualify for a discount.”"

            "body": "If you’ve ever wondered whether there are benefits to taking a vacation or traveling, there is good news. Research shows that vacations can help you live longer and improve your mental and physical health.According to a 2016 Harvard study, when travelers planned out their vacations at least a month in advance, traveled far from work and met new people, there was a 94% improvement in energy and outlook when they returned to work.Conversely, the study also found that poorly planned and stressful vacations have the opposite effect. They will eliminate the benefits of a vacation.Beyond the mental health benefits of travel and vacations, another study found clear health benefits to taking a vacation. In fact, men who took less than three weeks of vacation time annually had a 37% greater chance of dying than those who took more than three weeks.But not all vacations are created equal. The vacation experts at Hilton Grand Vacations, a vacation ownership company, offer these six smart ways to maximize your time away.1. Go with people you love.Numerous studies point to the health benefits of having a strong social support network, and a vacation can be a great way to nurture and strengthen those relationships. According to the Mayo Clinic, social support can improve the ability to cope with stressful situations, alleviate emotional distress, enhance self-esteem and lower heart attack risk factors such as high blood pressure.“To give yourself the flexibility to expand your social circle, stay somewhere with enough space to accommodate extra people so you can invite friends or family to join you,” recommends Kian Conley, with Hilton Grand Vacations. “With vacation ownership, also known as timeshare, you can swap the confinement of traditional hotel rooms and the uncertainty of private home rental for spacious multi-bedroom suites with full kitchens, living and dining areas, and laundry facilities. That gives you and your guests plenty of space to spread out and enjoy each other’s company.”2. Eat well-balanced meals.One of the great pleasures of going on vacation can be trying new and exotic foods, but remember the basics of good nutrition.Consider staying somewhere with a kitchen, because while you may enjoy eating out at restaurants some of the time, eating out for every single meal every single day can become tiresome. Plus, having a kitchen gives you more control over what you eat because you know the ingredients. Not to mention, cooking with family and friends can be a fun and relaxing bonding experience.3. Exercise.There's no question that exercise reduces stress and improves health. According to Harvard Health Publishing, exercise reduces the levels of stress hormones in the body, including cortisol and adrenaline. Additionally, it stimulates the production of endorphins, which are the body's natural painkillers and mood lifters.So, whether it's walking on the beach, working out at the fitness center or attending a yoga class, a vacation — especially one in a resort setting with workout amenities — gives you a great opportunity to take care of yourself. You can also take advantage of being away from your normal routine to start a new exercise habit that you can continue long after the vacation is over.4. Explore new places.According to research reported by the American Psychological Association, vacations can improve mood and reduce stress by removing people from the activities and environments that they associate with stress and anxiety. Getting away and exploring new places stimulates your mind and may also give you an attitude boost. The APA says that even a short vacation can reduce stress, citing a small Japanese study that found just a three-day trip lowered perceived stress levels and lowered levels of the stress hormone cortisol.5. Catch up on Zzzs.Many people pack daily life with non-stop activity from sunup to sundown, which can lead to a constant state of stress, making it difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep. According to the American Institute of Stress, being overworked and overstimulated without enough time to wind down can confuse the body about when it's time for action and when it's time to rest. Use your vacation to reset your body clock and get the rest you need. You may even want to sneak in a nap or two.6. Plan ahead but be flexible.“Find ways to vacation that give you options about who to bring with you, where to go and what to do,” recommends Conley. “As an example, timeshare from Hilton Grand Vacations offers flexibility by letting you choose bigger accommodations with home-away-from-home conveniences. We also offer flexibility around where to stay and time of year to travel, so that you can go back to your favorite tried-and-true destination again and again, or branch out and explore the world.”"

            "body": "According to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), cooking is the leading cause of home fires and home fire injuries — and the second leading cause of home fire deaths. Cooking fires increase during the holiday season. The type of cooking appliances used makes a difference; people using electric ranges showed a higher risk of cooking fires (and associated losses) than those using gas ranges.The good news? Technology mixed with safe cooking behavior can make a big difference. Here are some tips for protecting people and property from stove fires.6 ways to guard against kitchen fires1. Install the right technology. Anyone cooking on an electric coil stove top can make it significantly safer by replacing the coils with SmartBurner. Unlike traditional electric stove coils that can get dangerously hot very quickly, SmartBurners are designed with temperature limiting control technology that helps keep them from reaching the high temperatures that can cause most cooking oils to auto-ignite. By controlling the temperature, the burner lets you cook your food as usual, but with peace of mind.2. Check the area for fire dangers. Before turning on your stovetop, move anything that can catch fire away from the heat source. This includes mail, towels, napkins, paper plates, pizza boxes or even cleaning supplies. Wipe up spilled grease so it won’t catch fire.3. Dress for success. Loose sleeves and clothing can catch fire. Instead, wear clothes with short sleeves, or roll them up. In the NFPA study, clothes catching fire was a key factor in 14% of deaths caused by home cooking fires.4. Be ready to act fast. When you cook, keep a cookie sheet or large pan lid nearby. If there is a pan fire, you can quickly cover the pan and put out the flames. Then turn off the heat and leave the pan covered until it cools. Never try to move a burning pan, as that can spread the flames.5. Create a kid-free zone. Aim to keep children at least three feet away from any area where you’re cooking. And never hold a child while you’re cooking or moving around hot liquids or foods. Be especially careful during the holidays. The NFPA reports that the peak days for home cooking fires last year were Thanksgiving and Christmas — times when family tends to gather around the kitchen.6. Don’t leave. This one sounds obvious, but unattended cooking was cited as the leading cause of cooking fires and injuries in the NFPA study. Stay in the kitchen and keep an eye on what you fry, broil and grill. If you need to leave the kitchen, turn the stove top OFF. When you are roasting, simmering or baking food, stay at home and check it often. Set a timer to remind you to check the food while it is cooking.By following these tips for fire safety in the kitchen, you can help save people and property from the leading cause of home fires — cooking.

            "summary": "Learn expert tips for an amazing autumn garden.",
            "body": "The changing season offers a new opportunity to grow fall-friendly plants. Gardening is a great way to decorate your space with beautiful blooms, grow fresh vegetables that produce delicious cool season harvests, and is a safe, healthy activity to engage in while practicing social distancing and enjoying the outdoors. Whether you have a small patio, high-rise rooftop, quaint sunny corner of your yard or even a balcony, the experts at Ball Horticultural Company share their fall gardening insights for growing a successful and stunning garden this season.Prepare for plantingIf you have plants that have matured from the summer gardening season, it's time to clean up to prepare for new growth. Remove surface plants and use a tiller or hand tools to remove root matter under the soil. Add compost or gardening soil to pots, window boxes and other garden spaces, so they are ready with rich nutrients to support fall plant growth. If you’ve grown hardy perennials, just a brief tidy-up is needed. Clip away any brown foliage or spent flowers and provide a light covering of mulch at the base of the plant to ready them for frosty temperatures.Embrace fall huesRich reds, vivid oranges and happy yellows are traditional autumnal hues that add energy to your gardens as temperatures turn. A classic coneflower and pollinator favorite, like the Sombrero Echinacea from Darwin Perennials, will brighten your space even as temperatures fall. Available in a variety of colors, Sombrero Baja Burgundy and Fiesta Orange are ideal for bringing vibrant fall color to sunny spaces and for attracting bees, songbirds and butterflies to your yard. Tip: Leave the older blooms of Echinacea on their stems to feed wildlife into the winter. Then cut them back after their feast to put new energy into the plant for spring.Flowers that thriveAnother colorful and easy care option are Cool Wave Pansies, a fast-growing, long-lasting trailing pansy available in a variety of bold colors perfect for revamping your outdoor space for fall. A cool-season gardener’s dream, you can feel confident that these blooms will thrive even as fall temperatures ebb and flow. Check out Cool Wave Raspberry Swirl with cheerful magenta and white petals and a delightful yellow center. Tip: Place your Cool Wave Pansies where you’ve also planted bulbs. Their hardiness will make them the first pansy to reappear next spring for two seasons of enjoyment.Enjoy homegrown vegetablesIn addition to adding style to your space with fall flowers, incorporate seasonal vegetables to enjoy fresh, healthy produce straight from your backyard or patio.

            "html": "<p>The changing season offers a new opportunity to grow fall-friendly plants. Gardening is a great way to decorate your space with beautiful blooms, grow fresh vegetables that produce delicious cool season harvests, and is a safe, healthy activity to engage in while practicing social distancing and enjoying the outdoors. Whether you have a small patio, high-rise rooftop, quaint sunny corner of your yard or even a balcony, the experts at <a href=\"http://www.ballhort.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Ball Horticultural Company</a> share their fall gardening insights for growing a successful and stunning garden this season.</p><p><strong>Prepare for planting</strong></p><p>If you have plants that have matured from the summer gardening season, it's time to clean up to prepare for new growth. Remove surface plants and use a tiller or hand tools to remove root matter under the soil. Add compost or gardening soil to pots, window boxes and other garden spaces, so they are ready with rich nutrients to support fall plant growth. If you’ve grown hardy perennials, just a brief tidy-up is needed. Clip away any brown foliage or spent flowers and provide a light covering of mulch at the base of the plant to ready them for frosty temperatures.</p><p><strong>Embrace fall hues</strong></p><p>Rich reds, vivid oranges and happy yellows are traditional autumnal hues that add energy to your gardens as temperatures turn. A classic coneflower and pollinator favorite, like the Sombrero Echinacea from Darwin Perennials, will brighten your space even as temperatures fall. Available in a variety of colors, <a href=\"https://www.darwinperennials.com/products/plantinfo/?phid=024102187033148\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Sombrero Baja Burgundy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.darwinperennials.com/products/plantinfo/?phid=024102187044596\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Fiesta Orange</a> are ideal for bringing vibrant fall color to sunny spaces and for attracting bees, songbirds and butterflies to your yard. Tip: Leave the older blooms of Echinacea on their stems to feed wildlife into the winter. Then cut them back after their feast to put new energy into the plant for spring.</p><p><strong>Flowers that thrive</strong></p><p>Another colorful and easy care option are <a href=\"http://www.wavegardening.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Cool Wave Pansies</a>, a fast-growing, long-lasting trailing pansy available in a variety of bold colors perfect for revamping your outdoor space for fall. A cool-season gardener’s dream, you can feel confident that these blooms will thrive even as fall temperatures ebb and flow. Check out <a href=\"https://www.wavegardening.com/WaveFamily/PlantInformation.aspx?phid=046706339004443\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cool Wave Raspberry Swirl</a> with cheerful magenta and white petals and a delightful yellow center. Tip: Place your Cool Wave Pansies where you’ve also planted bulbs. Their hardiness will make them the first pansy to reappear next spring for two seasons of enjoyment.</p><p><strong>Enjoy homegrown vegetables</strong></p><p>In addition to adding style to your space with fall flowers, incorporate seasonal vegetables to enjoy fresh, healthy produce straight from your backyard or patio. <a href=\"https://www.burpeehomegardens.com/Vegetables/PlantDetails.aspx?plantid=5783\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Burpee Sweet Thang Cabbage</a> adds beauty to any garden with its attractive dark green leaves.

But even if your bucket list is dominated by world travel and adventure, that doesn’t mean you have to give up on it altogether. Instead, think outside the box, or the bucket in this case. You may be surprised by what you can “check off” from the comforts of home.If you’re not quite sure where to start, think about all those things you've always wanted to do, but never had time for. What would make the cut? Learning a new language? Redecorating your home? Honing your skills in the kitchen? In today’s uncertain times, a bucket half-full mindset is encouraged.1. Witness a once-in-a-lifetime event You may be feeling more inclined than ever before to take your curiosity outdoors. After all, it’s the perfect time to discover the world of celestial wonders. Perhaps you’d like to see a meteor shower up close? Or maybe a lunar eclipse? If there are too many city lights where you live, sneak off to an isolated spot outside of town with less light pollution where you can observe the stars while social distancing.2. Learn a foreign languageWhether you’ve had an itch to learn Japanese or are hoping to brush up on your high school French, why not start now? There are a lot of virtual language learning options to choose from, but perhaps the best-known is Rosetta Stone.With more than 25 years under its belt, Rosetta Stone’s offerings have evolved to include some of the best features and experiences the virtual learning world has to offer. For example, Rosetta Stone’s 20-minute Live Lessons help you practice listening and speaking with a native-speaking coach — because real-life conversation is the best way to hone your language skills. Best of all, Live Lessons are free — you don’t even need a subscription to participate in them.3. Create wonders in the kitchenChallenge yourself in the kitchen by taking your cooking skills to an international level. Learn what 'chiffonade' and 'umami' mean, and then put your new culinary know-how into practice. Start by focusing on one dish you’ve always wanted to make; then research all the different types of recipes for it. Let the great experimenting begin!4. Take up a new hobbyThere’s no time like quarantine to learn how to knit, make fishing lures, or play the piano. We recommend exploring hobbies that let you dive into other cultures, like Japanese brush painting or Norwegian wood carving. You can find tutorials on the internet for whatever you’d like to try. To get started, search for how-to videos and beginner articles on the hobby so you can uncover what types of supplies you’ll need.5. Adopt a rescue animalFeeling social distancing fatigue? Consider adopting a pet! But first, make sure your place is pet-ready for your fur-ever companion. Get your home dog-proofed or cat-proofed and make sure you’re stocked with all the necessary supplies.6. Plan your next adventureIf you’re still trying to scratch your international travel bug itch, start researching the place you’d like to go next. Learn about that country's geography, history, culture, food and language. Once you’ve mastered that destination’s native tongue, you’ll have all the tools you need to set forth and explore the world when international travel returns."

Crafting seasonal décor instead of shopping for it gives you and your family something to occupy your extra time at home and helps you avoid big crowds and shopping stress.Perhaps you’ll make wooden signs with jolly messages or metal snowflakes covered in lights? Or maybe you’ll craft ornaments for the tree or engrave messages into the menorah? No matter the craft, a homemade holiday novelty will bring a sense of pride and happiness to all.Ready to get crafty and holiday savvy? Here’s what to do:1) Make a planVisualize your project in your space and measure the location so you know what supplies you need. Take a look around to notice what areas have the most room. Get a view from the outside to see what your neighbors will see when passing by.Browse social media/decoration sites for inspiration. Save pictures of your favorites and then picture it fitting in your space. You could even sketch out your design on paper to get a clearer vision of what you’re going to create.Locate your sources of electricity if you want to incorporate lights, music or even snow machines (Hey, we can dream!). Be sure you have extension cords if you’ll need them.2) Shop for your materialsShop for and select the items that are eye-catching and fun. Consider bright, festive colors and pretty patterns.Research the items you need, and what stores near you carry them before you leave to save some time. Price check between stores to ensure you don’t overspend. If possible, you can even order online supplies ahead of time to avoid the crowds.3) Have the best tools in your tool beltEquip yourself with tools that are lightweight, versatile, portable, user friendly and the best to get the job done. The new MakerX line of tools from Worx gives you a range of creative options, allowing you to create from anywhere and perfecting the small details that make all the difference. The tool set revolves around a 20V Power Hub battery that powers five versatile tools, including an air brush, angle grinder, mini heat gun, rotary tool and wood and metal grinder, so the possibilities are limitless.Test out your tools on some scraps first before diving into your perfect materials and always follow safety measures and be careful when handling tools.4) Set the moodYou’ve got everything you need so now it’s time to start feeling festive. Light an apple cinnamon, vanilla cookie, fir and firewood or whatever spiced-snow-scent-tickles-your-fancy candle, turn on the cold weather carols and get your groove on.Pour a cup of cocoa — or a glass of spiked cider for mom and dad — and get to work!5) Kick back and admire your workEnjoy the company of those around you as you work together to make your holiday crafts and see the beauty in creating something with your hands, regardless of the imperfections. Work any mistakes into your final design. After all, the experience is half the fun, and you’re making memories that will last forever.Proudly display your holiday decorations in and out of your home for yourself, your family and your neighbors to enjoy.Take lots of pictures for friends and family who can’t be there in person and share your work on social media. A little joy goes a long way."

            "body": "Never before has a home’s outdoor space been more cherished or vital. It’s not surprising then that nearly two-thirds of American homeowners have either recently undertaken or are in the process of upgrading their home’s exterior, according to Porch.com. For those of you still in the planning phase, professional designer and TV personality Alison Victoria, host of HGTV’s “Windy City Rehab,” suggests four DIY-friendly projects to undertake this fall to turn your backyard into an outdoor oasis.Deck it out. A great deck space can add valuable square footage to a home for al fresco dining, outdoor fun or just a refreshing retreat between Zoom meetings. The first thing to remember when planning a deck build is that materials matter. Consider building with composite decking, like Trex, which features a beautiful wood-grain pattern without the constant upkeep of wood. This high-performance, low-maintenance option won’t ever need sanding or staining, and only requires soap and water cleanings to retain its color and appearance for years to come.“Trex is built to withstand the test of time, which is one of the many reasons I chose to use it in my own backyard,” says Victoria. “You can’t beat minimal maintenance on a deck that will still look like new after harsh winters like we have in Chicago. As a bonus, I love that it’s eco-friendly and made from 95% recycled materials.”Go green. Put your green thumb to use by starting a vegetable garden or sprucing up your backyard with new plants and seasonal flowers. If you’re looking to create privacy, a popular and eco-friendly solution is to build a living wall that can shield you from neighbors while surrounding your outdoor space with flowers and fresh herbs. Planter boxes for a vertical wall are relatively easy to build. If your skills are more advanced, consider adding a drip irrigation system so you don’t have to worry about watering.Liven with lattice. For a clever — and easy — design trick that adds both personal style and functionality to any outdoor space, consider incorporating lattice. Perfect for enhancing privacy or hiding unsightly views such as garbage cans and lawn equipment, lattice is durable, lightweight and easy to install. The Trex® LatticeWorks™ collection offers exclusive styles ranging from traditional to art deco in panels that can be applied to structures such as arbors, trellises and gazebos, or used as wainscoting or deck skirting.Create an outdoor room. Just like the inside of your home, you can establish separate outdoor areas for relaxing, cooking, dining and socializing. A pergola is perfect for creating the look and feel of an “outdoor room,” serving to frame a space while adding a distinct, architectural element. Incorporate traditionally interior accents like plush furnishings, accent pillows, throw blankets and an area rug — all weather-resistant, of course — to create an inviting and comfortable outdoor haven.“When it comes to backyard design, pergolas remain on-trend due to their versatility and limitless design possibilities,” adds Victoria. “They are great for adding definition — and drama — to any deck.”For more DIY ideas and outdoor living inspiration, visit www.Trex.com."

            "body": "As members of the family, we love our pets unconditionally. We would do anything to ensure they live long and happy lives with us. That’s why as they age it is important to be aware of the different ways to care for our pets to help them remain healthy and energized as they reach senior status.Purina has answers to these common questions about aging pets to help you be the best pet parent for your furry family member.1. When are pets considered 'senior'?According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, our cats and dogs are generally considered senior when they reach the age of 7 years. However, some pets, like larger dog breeds, are considered seniors when they are 6 years old.No matter what age your pet is, make sure they get regular veterinary checkups and necessary preventive care, like required vaccinations. Your veterinarian may recommend older pets get additional tests to watch for specific health conditions, and more frequent checkups to prevent future problems.Watch for signs of aging that could need attention. You may notice changes in their skin and coat, their appetites may diminish, or their activity level may slow down.“Changes in appetite and behavior may indicate underlying health concerns, so it’s worth sharing your observations with your vet,” said Dr. Kurt Venator, DVM, Ph.D. and chief veterinary officer at Purina. “Dogs may also experience hearing, vision or cognitive changes as they age that are hard to detect, so pay attention if your dog responds less promptly to voice commands, bumps into things as they walk or seems to have trouble doing activities he once enjoyed.”Reduced mobility, limping or having trouble managing steps can also indicate issues like osteoarthritis.2. Do pets need special nutrition as they get older?A 2020 Purina Pet Ownership Survey found that 93% of pet owners feel it is important to choose food specific to a pet’s life stage. And while most people know puppies and kittens have different nutritional needs than adult dogs and cats, few owners realize that senior animals also need food tailored to them.An effective senior pet food formula can help control chronic health conditions, manage a pet’s weight and improve their mental focus. For example, Purina Pro Plan Bright Mind Adult 7+ is formulated specifically for senior dogs. It includes ingredients like enhanced botanical oils that are Medium-Chain Triglycerides, which can help improve brain function in older dogs. Purina scientists have spent years developing formulas that help boost energy levels and manage caloric intake for your senior dog, while ensuring that he or she receives the right balance of food and nutrients.3. How can you keep an older pet active and alert?Dr. Ragen McGowan, Ph.D., a Purina pet behavior scientist, notes that “just like people, older pets can become set in their ways and naturally slow down as they age. Keeping your senior pet active is a simple, fun and effective way to help them stay healthy and nimble. Remember, that it is just as important to keep your pet’s mind active as it is to keep their body active.”Try out a couple of these activities with your pet:With regular care, proper nutrition and loving attention, aging pets can live a long, enriching life and enjoy every moment they have with you.To learn more about caring for your senior pet, visit www.Purina.com."

            "body": "You may think fall is time to put the sandals and sunscreen away, but autumn months offer a great opportunity to explore beaches near and far. Consider these eight reasons to escape to the beach with your family and create a fall you'll always remember.1. A change of scenery is good for mental healthMany people have spent the past several months staying close to home, but changing your scenery can support mental wellness. Whether you visit a beach nearby or take a trip to a different state, even one day away enjoying Mother Nature can help you rejuvenate.2. Sand is soothing and can help reduce stressWith remote work still in full swing and many kids studying at home, stress levels can be high. Fortunately, researchers have found that just touching sand can inspire relaxation. You'll find plenty if you plan an escape for fall to the Myrtle Beach area’s 60 miles of pristine coastline and watch as your worries melt away. Learn more at www.visitmyrtlebeach.com.3. The beach is a great educational opportunityWhether your child is a preschooler or teen, consider taking them on an educational journey exploring the beach. From learning about the local flora and fauna to studying an area's unique history, this is one lesson they'll wish would never end.4. You can enjoy warm weather safelyWhile temperatures are dropping in many areas of the country, coastlines often see temperate climates throughout fall. With warm autumn weather, the Myrtle Beach coastline has plenty of room to social distance while dipping your toes in the sand, listening to the sounds of waves crashing and destressing from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.5. Sunshine boosts your vitamin DAlong with the fresh air, being on a beach brings plenty of sunshine, which boosts your vitamin D levels as well as your mood. Just make sure to wear proper sunscreen to prevent burns, even on overcast days.6. Smaller crowds make travel enjoyableThe change of season means crowds are down, which can mean a safer, more enjoyable travel experience. There are endless ways to try something new along the Grand Strand safely. Spend the day bird watching at Huntington Beach State Park before heading to the park’s nearby beach or visiting sensory-friendly animal sanctuaries and exhibits at Ripley’s Aquarium of Myrtle Beach.7. Accommodations provide amazing viewsFinding quiet spots with breathtaking backdrops is not difficult in the Myrtle Beach area. If you prefer to stick to your hotel room, choose a property that offers an oceanfront view. For instance, Island Vista Resort is unique in that all of its suites’ balconies face the ocean, so there’s really no worry that you will get stuck with anything less than an unobstructed look at the Atlantic Ocean.8. Enjoy autumn splendor all aroundIn many beach towns, the beauty of fall extends beyond the shoreline. Check out the local parks and gardens to enjoy stunning scenery as well. When in Myrtle Beach, check out Brookgreen Gardens. Its massive grounds feature 9,000 acres of floral gardens and outdoor sculptures. Tip: admission is good for seven consecutive days."

            "author": "BrandPoint",

            "body": "Online grocery shopping is on the rise, and the options are plentiful — from having a shopper deliver goods at your door to curbside pickup and more. But even the most experienced grocery shoppers may find they need to learn some new tricks to achieve online grocery shopping success.Tip #1: Find the delivery method that best suits your needsNeed lots of fresh produce delivered right away? Look for a service that gives your list to a personal shopper to take through a local store and deliver at your doorstep. If you’re looking to stock up on pantry staples, a service that ships from a warehouse is a great way to get what you need without having to step foot inside a store. Many stores are also offering curbside pickup, where you pick out your items online, check out and drive to the store to have your order placed directly into your trunk.Tip #2: Be an eco-friendly online shopperThere are plenty of opportunities to keep sustainability in mind while online grocery shopping. Packages that weigh less will translate to reduced carbon emissions during shipping. For example, carton packages are about 60% lighter than cans, and they are made mainly from renewable materials. Even pet food can be found in cartons.Keep in mind that many of your chilled favorites, such as milk or plant-based dairy alternatives, may also be available in shelf-stable cartons. This means the product doesn’t need to be chilled during shipping, eliminating the need to pack items on ice. No matter how long shipping takes, or how long the box remains on the doorstep, your items will arrive safe to eat and with the quality you expect.Tip #3: Plan aheadTake advantage of the ability to assemble your grocery cart at home by assessing any long-term needs for staple items, like pasta, broths and beans. If you’re short on food storage space, look for foods packaged in square shapes. Stackable, shelf-stable cartons help make the most of every inch. Many canned goods now come in carton packages too.Tip #4: Give specific instructions to your shopperIt’s sad but true: Sometimes your favorite items will be out of stock. If you’re using a personal shopping service, make sure to include notes for preferred replacement items, especially if there’s another brand or flavor you’d like if your first choice is unavailable. You can even note how green you’d like your bananas or how ripe your ideal avocado may be.Tip #5: Pay attention to packagingFood packaging is designed to protect its contents — keeping the food safe and flavorful while preserving its nutrients. As you shop online, look for packaging that protects the planet once it has served its purpose. Many types of food and beverage packages can be recycled and turned into new materials. For example, cartons can be turned into paper products, such as tissues and paper towels, and even sustainable building materials!Online grocery shopping might require you to approach shopping a bit differently, but with a little bit of planning and practice you can have the food and other supplies you and your family need delivered directly to your doorstep."

You can even note how green you’d like your bananas or how ripe your ideal avocado may be.</p><p><strong>Tip #5: Pay attention to packaging</strong></p><p>Food packaging is designed to protect its contents — keeping the food safe and flavorful while preserving its nutrients. As you shop online, look for packaging that protects the planet once it has served its purpose. Many types of food and beverage packages can be recycled and turned into new materials. For example, cartons can be turned into paper products, such as tissues and paper towels, and even sustainable building materials!</p><p>Online grocery shopping might require you to approach shopping a bit differently, but with a little bit of planning and practice you can have the food and other supplies you and your family need delivered directly to your doorstep.</p>",

We could go on.And in the worst of times? From political debates about wearing masks in a pandemic to a contested Electoral College result, America continues to leave the rest of the world baffled and, in no small part, shocked during the turbulence of the past 12 months. And: totally and utterly obsessed.“I have never known people [around the world] on tenterhooks in the way that they are” at this moment, says Katty Kay, a veteran BBC journalist based in Washington, D.C. They want to know “what the heck is going on in this country right now,” she says. Enter Carlos Watson, the most important new face in the U.S. media industry who’s emerging as one of the digital generation’s preferred voices to make sense of the turbulence of 2020. To help cut through the noise, Kay and Watson co-host When Katty Met Carlos, one of the best podcasts to help you understand U.S. politics and society today. The program has already topped the podcast charts in over a dozen countries, and recently had its season extended. Watson is the CEO and co-founder of OZY, a dynamic media startup that has impressed many by being able to secure groundbreaking partnerships with titans of the media industry such as A+E Networks and iHeartRadio; the BBC being the latest of those, cementing OZY’s role as a global authority in news, discussion and analysis.With insights from journalists, politicians and experts from across the globe, When Katty Met Carlos takes a step back to examine the state of the American experiment from the ground up, providing forward-looking insight and commentary you can’t find anywhere else. Here’s a look at some of the key perspectives that Kay and Watson have unearthed about America as seen in the eyes of the rest of the world today.1. America humbled?With the world’s highest number of cases and among the highest rates of deaths per capita due to the COVID-19 pandemic, what Americans often describe as the “greatest country in the world” has struggled in the greatest test the world has faced in a generation. Has the pandemic created a dent in the idea of American exceptionalism? And, Kay ponders in the opening episode of When Katty Met Carlos, has America’s national self-confidence actually harmed its ability to learn from other countries’ responses to the pandemic? The rest of the world is starting to wonder whether America has been humbled by 2020.2. A former role model, now questionedThe United States has long been admired as a global gold standard in economics and democracy — and its global leadership in both areas is currently in peril. The coronavirus pandemic has amplified inequalities that have become a hallmark of American capitalism, with growing rates of poverty among children and racial minorities. Instead of looking to the U.S. for leadership, many countries have recently turned to the German policy of Kurzarbeit (short-time working), in which governments top up the wages of staff on reduced hours to offset unemployment. In the realm of politics, a shaky electoral process, an impeached president and a lack of public trust in institutions have many around the world wondering whether American democracy is under threat. Several American adversaries, such as Russia and China, have openly gloated at the apparent stability of their own political systems relative to the U.S., and some younger democracies for which the U.S. would typically be a role model, such as Bolivia, have questioned whether America is really an example worth following.3. A global conversation about raceThe United States has been forced to confront a conversation about race with more urgency than it has in decades, and the world is watching. While the issue of racism afflicts every society, there is perhaps no country that faces it as acutely as the U.S., with the potential exception of South Africa. “Without having the conversation about what happened here in the past, there will be no conversation about what happens next,” South African journalist Justice Malala tells When Katty Met Carlos. The Truth and Reconciliation process there, says Malala, had the effect that “everyone came to be under the tent” of mutual understanding, even though many people ultimately left those discussions unsatisfied about the path forward. America still needs to get under the tent, he says. Whether the U.S. will take the baton of leadership from South Africa on this issue remains to be seen.To continue these conversations about the future of America and its role in the world, subscribe to When Katty Met Carlos on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher or wherever else you listen to podcasts."

            "body": "Billionaire Mark Cuban was fired from his first job in software. Actress Jameela Jamil endured three life-changing medical diagnoses before breaking big in Hollywood. Musician John Legend was receiving unemployment checks while waiting for his big break.Life is rarely linear or straightforward — even for some of the most successful people in the world. From minor speed bumps to cavernous potholes that force an abrupt U-turn, everyone experiences significant disruption to what they had imagined their life might look like. For many of us, 2020 has been one of those years.“From the pandemic to the recession to racial injustice to the election, the big, crazy stories of this year have affected everyone’s lives in very real and often very distressing ways,” says Carlos Watson, a journalist, entrepreneur and CEO of cutting-edge media company OZY, tapped as the next HBO. “It’s a very trying time for people across the country and the globe — and it might well continue for quite some time,” continues Watson, who is also the host of Defining Moments With OZY on Hulu, one of the best interview shows currently available to stream, featuring in-depth interviews with culture-defining celebrities who have battled adversity on the road to success. Watson and OZY’s relentless focus on highlighting unique, fresh stories has again paid off, with impactful and candid reflections on failure, loss, struggle and resilience making Defining Moments With OZY perhaps the most important show of 2020. While no two paths are the same, there’s a lot we can learn from figures like Amy Purdy, who was given a 2 percent chance to live before fighting back to win Olympic gold, and Jason Collins, who had to hide his sexuality for decades for fear of rejection.As everyone across the globe faces their own Defining Moment this year, there are several lessons we can all take away to help us find hope for a way out of difficulty. Here are just a few:1. The power of being brokeThe importance of perseverance — the determination to keep trying, keep learning and keep perfecting your craft, even when things aren’t going your way — is something most hugely successful people emphasize. From selling garbage bags door to door as a teenager to moving to Dallas without a job or a place to live, Mark Cuban has always been hustling, as he reveals on Defining Moments With OZY. “I was always healthily afraid,” says Cuban. And before he became John Legend, John Stephens felt he was on the cusp of breaking through — six years before he was anywhere close.2. Difficult personal circumstances may have silver liningsSometimes an unplanned change in life circumstances can precipitate a positive reevaluation of personal goals — whether that unexpected event comes in the form of a medical emergency, mental health issue, job loss or freak accident. For Jameela Jamil, it was all four. While her life has been shaped by a cancer scare, which caused her to move to the U.S., where she ultimately found fame; a battle with body dysmorphia; and cursing during her first live TV appearance, it was a life-threatening car accident at age 17 that was the biggest turning point in her life. “Getting hit by the car was the best thing that ever happened to me. I’d do it all over again,” says Jamil. Similarly, Olympian Amy Purdy tells Watson how her bacterial meningitis diagnosis, which led to the amputation of both her legs, instilled in her a new sense of drive that has shaped her life for the better.3. The battle to fit in can make you strongerIn many cases, personal struggle comes from external forces such as discrimination, prejudice and exclusion. For Dominique Jackson, the trans star of Pose, and Jason Collins, the first active NBA athlete to come out as gay, the struggle with their identity included being rejected by family. Both Jackson and Collins found external support networks that helped them thrive — and ultimately repair their family relationships. Sophia Chang, an Asian American hip-hop mogul, has struggled against being marginalized for her race, gender and immigrant status her entire life. “Fine-tuning that anger and owning it” is the key to turning vulnerability into strength, Chang reveals in her Defining Moments With OZY interview.For more inspiring insights to help you make sense of this challenging year, binge the entire first season of Defining Moments With OZY — now streaming on Hulu."

            "body": "Was your favorite angler a good angler this past year? Did they cry? Did they pout? Santa Bass is coming to town and he’s been checking his list, twice. He sees all the times when an angler acted with kindness at the boat landing as well as those anglers who cut off another angler at a good fishing spot.If your favorite angler isn’t on Santa Bass’s naughty list and deserves lots of gifts this year, here are 10 can’t-miss gifts to put under the tree this year.1. Hot Bass Fishing Lure  One of the hottest new lures for 2021 is Rapala’s new balsa-wood flat-sided crankbait, the OG Slim 6, designed by 2019 Bassmaster Classic Champion Ott DeFoe. The OG Slim 6 is a non-rattling, easy-casting crankbait that swims with a medium wobble and tight side-to-side action. The lure dives to 6 feet when fished on 12-pound test line — hence the “6” in its name. It’s perfect for those who love bass fishing.2. Fishing Pliers – When an angler catches a big fish and is dealing with big hooks, they need pliers to quickly and safely release a fish. New high-performance Elite Pliers by Rapala are armored with an exclusive coating that protects against abrasion, corrosion and ultra-violet light from the sun. These 7-inch pliers include a unique, patented “Mag Spring,” which keeps the pliers’ hybrid jaws open and ready. Flip the switch and “Mag Lock” tightly secures the jaws for safe storage. The hybrid jaws feature interlocking front teeth, to ensure a lock-tight clasp on hooks.3. 50-lb. High Contrast Digital Scale – It’s not easy to decide what feature you will like the best with the Rapala 50-lb. High Contrast Digital Scale. The reverse image LCD illuminated screen makes reading the light text on dark background easy, even on bright, sunny days. The directional pad operation offers familiar and intuitive navigation through the menu options. Quick reference for min. and max. bin and total weight. Packed with “must-have” features and a fish friendly gripper to secure your catch. Runs on 2 AAA batteries (not included).4. Winter Beanies – Keep your favorite angler’s noggin warm with a winter beanie. It’s perfect for those cold, windy days on the water or ice.5. Pro-Grade Fishing Line – The only thing between an angler and the fish is the lure hooks and fishing line. Don’t leave it up to chance; use what the pros use. Sufix ProMix fishing line is a densely braided, but thin, fishing line that retains its color without costing too much green. It provides consistent quality, superior knot and shock strength, increased abrasion resistance and superior line performance. Its low-stretch qualities provide exceptional lure control, ultimate bite detection and firm hook-setting power.6. Toothy Monsters – If your favorite angler fishes for big toothy monsters such as muskies and northern pike, consider a large spinnerbait, such as the Blue Fox Super Bou spinnerbait. It measures 8.25 inches long and includes two size No. 8 Colorado blades and super fluffy marabou to create a thumping vibration that big fish can’t ignore.7. Giant Replica Lure – No, it’s not a lure for great white sharks. But it does make for an interesting conversation starter. This giant, 29-in. replica of a well-known fishing lure is a natural centerpiece in any guy’s mancave. It comes packaged in giant replica lure box carton.8. Protection Against the Sun and Wind – The best way to stay cool and comfortable on and off the water is with a Rapala Solid Core Performance Shirt. Its trend-forward design offers UV (30 SPF) protection along with moisture-wicking and 100% polyester interlock for ultimate comfort. Available in sizes XS to XXL.9. Fisherman’s Tool Combo – If you’re looking for an incredibly practical gift for that very practical angler in your life you can’t beat fishing tools such as pliers, a digital scale, scissors and a ruler.10. Warm sweatshirt – For cold, crisp days on the water, an angler needs a hooded sweatshirt to stay warm from the cold and wind. The Rapala sweatshirt is lined with a full fleece interior to keep your favorite angler comfortable without being too heavy, while a kangaroo front pouch allows for hands to stay toasty warm between casts."

According to a new Purina survey, 93% of consumers are grateful for their pets this holiday season. During this special time of year, we should give them some extra attention and love in return.From decking the halls, to planning the perfect pet-safe holiday feast, there are a number of ways to incorporate the dogs and cats we love into the season. Dr. Kurt Venator, DVM, PhD, and Chief Veterinary Officer at Purina, has gathered some pet-friendly tips for a safe and festive holiday season.Deck the Halls (Safely). While beautifully festive, some holiday plants can be poisonous or toxic, especially to children and dogs. Steer clear of holly, mistletoe and amaryllis — all of which can make your dog sick if ingested. If one of these plants has been eaten by mistake, be sure to contact your veterinarian immediately.Skip the Table Scraps. It’s tempting to slip our four-legged friends a taste of the holiday foods we love this time of year, but it’s best to stick to nutritionist developed and science-backed pet foods to avoid tummy trouble or an emergency vet visit. Many holiday favorites, from chocolate, grapes and raisins to ingredients like onions, can be hazardous to pets. Xylitol, an artificial sweetener found in things like gum, mints and candy can be very hazardous to dogs even in very small amounts. To make mealtime more special for your dog or cat, try mixing wet pet food with dry kibble to add texture. Cats can especially benefit from the hydration boost that wet food offers.Bring on the Cookie Swap. Instead of sharing sweet treats with your pets during the holidays, swap the cookies for new pet treats during your next shopping trip or online order. There are so many textures and flavors available, it’s easy to keep the wags and purrs coming. For dogs, incorporate flavors of the holiday season with options like The Pioneer Woman Bacon, Apple &amp; Maple Recipe Waffles Dog Treats or The Pioneer Woman Chicken Cranapple Recipe Jerky Sticks Dog Treats. For your feline friends, extend treat time with breakable pieces of Fancy Feast Savory Cravings cat treats. To avoid extra holiday weight on your pets, be sure to limit treats to be no more than 10% of their daily caloric intake.Run, Run, Rudolph. Weather permitting, take your dog on a long walk or run to enjoy in the sights (and smells) of the season and work off holiday meals and extra treats. Just be sure to clean off your pooch’s paws afterward if you’re walking on salted sidewalks. If the weather outside is frightful, engage in some indoor games and playtime to give your dog or cat the exercise and enrichment needed to stay happy and healthy. Purina pet enrichment expert, Alex Johnson, put together 10 creative cat and dog enrichment ideas that are worth checking out.Give back to pets in need. During the season of giving in a year of great need, there’s no better way to celebrate your pet and all the pets that give us unconditional love than by donating to nonprofits that help pets and people. According to Purina’s survey, more than 90% of consumers said they are planning to make a charitable contribution to one or more nonprofits this holiday season, and nearly 60% of consumers are considering giving to animal shelters and pet organizations.

            "body": "After seemingly years of breathless hype, 5G network technology has finally arrived across much of the country. Delivering increased connection speeds and improved call quality, 5G is the new state-of-the-art for wireless users, and both cellular providers and device manufacturers are rushing to convince customers to hop aboard this new “superfast” train.But for the average cellphone user, how important is it to make the switch to a 5G compatible device right now? Here are the key things to consider when making that decision.What does 5G mean?First, it’s important to understand what 5G means. The “G” stands for “Generation” — meaning, simply, this is the fifth generation of mobile networks since the industry started. It is a new global wireless standard, following 1G, 2G, 3G and 4G networks that preceded it. The technological advancements of 5G (providing higher data speeds during peak usage times, reducing lag time, etc.) were driven by the need to keep pace with the explosive growth of wireless use since the last standard (4G) was rolled out in 2010.What will 5G replace?Mobile networks have a limited amount of bandwidth to operate on. This means that when a new “Generation” of technology is rolled out, an older one has to be turned off to make room for it on the network. In the case of 5G, it will be replacing the oldest “Generation” which was still in use, 3G. 3G networks have been in use since 2001, and providers expect them to be out of service by the end of 2021.What does your current device use?Whether or not you need to act quickly to replace your wireless device depends entirely on how old it is. If you are still using a flip phone or smartphone that connects to wireless networks using 3G technology, you can expect a year or less of use before you will be unable to make or receive calls, or connect to mobile data, with it.If you have a phone purchased in the last few years that uses 4G, you won’t need to make a change anytime soon. As we see from 3G, the lifespan of each “Generation” of wireless technology lasts for around 20 years, so you’ll likely be able to stay connected using 4G for at least another 10 years (though your phone itself may not perform satisfactorily for that long).How do you use your device?For most users, the faster speeds provided by 5G networks will be noticeable primarily when performing data-heavy tasks with your phone, like streaming high definition video or downloading large files. If these are important to you, upgrading to a 5G device will be a definite benefit. However, if you are satisfied with the performance of your current phone using 4G networks, this standard will remain in place for the foreseeable future.Who’s your carrier?Wireless carriers have taken a variety of approaches to the arrival of 5G, with many offering incentives for customers to upgrade to newer devices. Their customer service is key to helping you understand your needs and what they have available. For instance, Consumer Cellular, which J.D. Power has named #1 for customer service among non-contract carriers nine times in a row, has begun offering 5G compatible phones in a variety of price ranges. The company focuses largely on customers ages 50 and up, and has helped successfully steer them through technology transitions for 25 years.As with any new technology, an informed consumer is a happy consumer. By understanding what 5G means, and what benefits it can provide, you’ll be able to make a decision that will ensure you have the wireless service that’s right for you."

            "body": "If you've considered gifting your son or daughter a smartphone, you’re not alone. In a survey by SellCell last year, about 41% of parents thought a smartphone was the top holiday or birthday gift choice for their teenager. But with Common Sense Media reporting that most (53%) kids have their own smartphone by the time they are 11, and 69% have one by age 12, how do you know when your child is ready for the responsibility — and potential pitfalls — of having the world at their fingertips?Here are questions you should ask before shopping for their first smartphone.1. How comfortable is your child talking to you about difficult topics like cyberbullying?Before you give your son or daughter a smartphone, start having consistent, open conversations about difficult topics like cyberbullying, which can have a lasting and damaging effect on your kids’ mental health.By creating open lines of communication about these difficult topics now, children will hopefully feel more comfortable reaching out to you if they’re being targeted online, or if they see cyberbullying happening to someone else.2. Can they handle the responsibility?What’s their track record getting their homework in on time, remembering their equipment for sports practice or not losing their retainer? If they’re generally responsible, your child could be ready to handle an expensive piece of tech.If they forgot their lunch twice in third grade, however, don’t hold it against them. Kids grow and change! This is actually a great opportunity to teach them about adult responsibilities, including paying bills and managing money.3. Do you have tools in place to limit their screen time?Most kids love video games, and between playing those games, watching TV, communicating with friends on social media and remote learning, your child is likely already spending a lot of time on screens.

            "html": "<p>If you've considered gifting your son or daughter a smartphone, you’re not alone. In a survey by SellCell last year, about 41% of parents thought a smartphone was the top holiday or birthday gift choice for their teenager. But with Common Sense Media reporting that most (53%) kids have their own smartphone by the time they are 11, and 69% have one by age 12, how do you know when your child is ready for the responsibility — and potential pitfalls — of having the world at their fingertips?</p><p>Here are questions you should ask before shopping for their first smartphone.</p><p><strong>1. How comfortable is your child talking to you about difficult topics like cyberbullying?</strong></p><p>Before you give your son or daughter a smartphone, start having consistent, open conversations about difficult topics like cyberbullying, which can have a lasting and damaging effect on your kids’ mental health.</p><p>By creating open lines of communication about these difficult topics now, children will hopefully feel more comfortable reaching out to you if they’re being targeted online, or if they see cyberbullying happening to someone else.</p><p><strong>2. Can they handle the responsibility?</strong></p><p>What’s their track record getting their homework in on time, remembering their equipment for sports practice or not losing their retainer? If they’re generally responsible, your child could be ready to handle an expensive piece of tech.</p><p>If they forgot their lunch twice in third grade, however, don’t hold it against them. Kids grow and change! This is actually a great opportunity to teach them about adult responsibilities, including paying bills and managing money.</p><p><strong>3. Do you have tools in place to limit their screen time?</strong></p><p>Most kids love video games, and between playing those games, watching TV, communicating with friends on social media and remote learning, your child is likely already spending a lot of time on screens. Access to a smartphone 24/7 has the potential to increase that. By a lot.</p><p>Make sure you have strategies for limiting screen time in place:</p><p>Concerns about screen addiction are real, so it's important to be aware of these dangers.

            "body": "New puppy owners have plenty of questions when it comes to their new pet — about training their puppy, puppy-proofing their home and what behaviors are considered “normal” for a growing dog. Perhaps the most important question, which is commonly misunderstood, is how to feed your puppy to make sure he or she grows up to be a healthy and happy adult dog.In fact, a recent survey by Purina found that many dog owners were unsure about how to correctly feed their growing pup. For example, the majority of puppy owners did not realize that breed size determines how long a dog is considered a puppy, and ultimately, how long their dog needs to be fed puppy food.'Puppies have specific nutritional requirements to help support their rapid growth and development,” said veterinarian at Purina Dr. Callie Harris, DVM. “Similar to babies, puppies' bodies are fast-growing, but unlike babies, puppies pack all their growth into one to two years.”Here's a guide to common questions about feeding your pup.Why should you feed your growing dog only puppy food?Puppies’ growing bodies need 25% more protein, 40% more fat and 140% more calcium than adult dogs. In addition, smaller kibble pieces are easier for a young dog with a smaller mouth to eat, especially smaller breeds.Dr. Harris explains that high-quality puppy food is balanced with essential nutrients like:Until what age is your puppy still considered a puppy?Your dog’s breed size determines how long they're considered a puppy. If you didn’t know this, you’re not alone. In the survey, 47% of small breed dog owners didn’t realize their dog needs to be fed puppy food for up to a year, and a whopping 92% of large breed dog owners didn’t realize their dog is actually considered a puppy for up to two years and needs to be fed puppy food for that period of time.If you’re unclear exactly how long to feed puppy food, it’s best to speak to your veterinarian to ensure you’re meeting your puppy’s specific nutritional requirements.How much food do they need?The amount of food your puppy needs depends on how much they’ll weigh at maturity — not their current weight. For example, a Labrador retriever will weigh more at maturity than a Russell terrier, so the larger breed size dog will require more food as a puppy.To avoid overfeeding, offer your pup three equal-sized meals each day, based on their daily caloric requirement recommendations split into three. Additionally, it’s important to establish a feeding routine at the same times each day to help keep a puppy’s digestive system regular, which can also make house training easier.For a comprehensive feeding chart to help determine how much to feed your puppy, along with lots of other information about caring for puppies, visit Purina.com/Puppy. Review the feeding instructions on the back of your puppy’s food bag and consult your veterinarian for questions regarding your specific puppy’s diet.What's the best way to transition to adult dog food?If you're wondering why you can't stick with puppy food for adult dogs, one reason is that puppy food is much higher in calories to help support your puppy’s growth, development and high energy levels. Continuing to feed puppy food past the point of maturity could result in weight gain, which can lead to other health problems, so transitioning to a balanced adult food once your puppy has grown into adulthood is important. When your dog becomes an adult, a gradual transition from puppy food to adult food helps avoid an upset stomach. Over 7-10 days, gradually introduce more and more of the new food mixed in with the old.Adult dogs may only need two meals per day, depending on their breed, size and activity level. Follow the feeding instructions on the food package to know how much food to feed your dog each day and split that into two meals. To ensure your dog is eating the right amount, it’s best to monitor their body condition or consult with your veterinarian.Following these guidelines will help you keep your young dog happy, healthy and growing strong.

Add excitement by exploring cuisines like those of North Africa, with flavor contrasts of spicy, sweet and tart. The following recipes use grapes as a fresh accent to the flavorful North African spices in each dish. Grapes are also a handy snack while putting the finishing touches on dinner.Harissa-spiced Steak with Grapes and Preserved Lemon delivers big flavor in an easy and quick way. Two North African ingredients, spicy harissa paste, a staple in Moroccan cuisine, and preserved lemon, a flavorful condiment with a mildly tart, but intensely lemony flavor, offer a zesty contrast to the refreshing and lightly dressed grape salad. Marinate the steak ahead of time — in the refrigerator during the day, overnight for more intense flavor, or even shortly before grilling.Quinoa with Grapes and Roasted Carrots reprises the North African theme with a flavorful seasoning of cumin, coriander, paprika and cinnamon, accented by the subtle sweetness of crisp, juicy grapes. To save time, make the carrots and quinoa in advance and assemble this side dish right before serving.

            "body": "This year more than ever, we’re all ready to kick back and enjoy a relaxing holiday season. Shopping online is a great way to get your shopping done safely and conveniently this year — in fact, the majority (59 percent) of holiday shoppers plan to shift more of their shopping online compared with last year, according to the National Retail Federation’s annual consumer holiday survey.Whether you love the thrill of holiday shopping or are usually more of a gifting procrastinator, here are a few simple strategies you can apply to your online shopping that will have you checking holiday errands off your list in no time, leaving you more time to celebrate with family and friends this year.1. Make a list (and check it twice)First, make a list of those people in your life that you want to delight with a special gift this year. Next, create a workable budget for your gift shopping as a whole, then break down that budget per person, deciding who you might want to splurge a little more on this year, versus those that might be just as happy with something simpler. That way you’ll know what you can afford before your list gets away from you.2. Start earlyNo need to wait until Black Friday this year to score incredible deals on everything you need this season. Beat the holiday rush by taking advantage of early savings and deals, so you can stress less and get on to enjoying the season. Amazon is kicking off the holiday shopping season earlier than ever with its Holiday Dash deals event, bringing Black Friday deals and discounts to all customers earlier than ever.Start snatching up deals now at www.Amazon.com/holidaydash, on the Amazon App, or by simply asking “Alexa, what are my deals?” With new deals dropping every day, you can shop with confidence that you’re getting Black Friday-worthy deals and incredible savings on a huge selection of products, making it easy to check everyone off the gift list earlier than ever. Best of all, online shopping means everything is delivered quickly and safely — helping you save even more time and money by not having to visit multiple stores.3. Let gift guides do the work for youNeed gifting inspiration? If you’ve got your list and budget together but are stuck on a few ideas, gift guides are the perfect place to start. Amazon’s holiday gift guides are easily sorted by things like price, age and areas of interest, so you can find something for everyone on your list, no matter the budget – just go to amazon.com/gifts. Still stumped? Let Alexa do the work for you by asking things like “Alexa, give me gift ideas under $50,” for more gifting inspiration within your budget.4. Get more for your dollar with easy saving hacksFor many, budgets are tighter than ever this year — in fact, a recent survey conducted by Accenture showed that nearly 1 in 4 are cutting holiday spending because of a tough year — making it more important than ever to get more for your holiday dollar.Luckily, in addition to scouting out early holiday deals there are some easy ways to get the best bang for your buck throughout the whole season. Check out Amazon Coupons for special offers that are updated frequently on thousands of products — all without the hassle of clipping, and set up the Amazon Assistant to easily monitor and compare prices on all the products you want, so you can be sure you are getting the best deals on all the best gifts. Or check out some of Amazon’s lesser known options, like Amazon’s Renewed Deals, where you can discover professionally inspected pre-owned, refurbished and open-box products.Follow these tips and you’ll feel more prepared than ever going into the holiday season!"

However you celebrate the holidays this year, why not find new ways to add special touches to make them extraordinary? For small household gatherings or virtual celebrations, bringing unique decorations and flavors together with a festive flair can make this year even more memorable.1. Streamline your decorYou’ve probably heard the expression “less is more.” This approach helps designers make striking statements in a space, using a simplified color palette or focusing on a single visual feature to make any room stand out.For your holiday decor, apply this approach by selecting one or two colors, or a single visual theme, to make your living space even more elegant and beautiful this year. For example, you could choose only silver and blue — or red and gold — decorations to trim the tree, or display only snowflake or reindeer themed decorations.Or you could find one single visual focus for each room for a dramatic visual statement, whether it's a gorgeous holly and pine centerpiece on your table or a wreath made from greenery and crimson ribbons for the wall. You’ll be amazed at how lovely and refined your rooms can look when you decorate with a more thoughtful focus.2. Toast with the ones you loveChoose a delightful, celebratory sparkling wine to grace your holiday dinner table and New Year’s evening. For example, Nino Franco Rustico Prosecco is the perfect choice for any occasion, with its light effervescence and refreshing fruitiness. This versatile, delicious prosecco pairs well with foods from spicy chicken wings on game day to roast turkey for your formal dinner.Need more gift ideas? Send out a couple of bottles of sparkling wine via Wine.com/NinoFranco to friends and family ahead of the holidays. That way, you’ll be able to toast together during your virtual gatherings.3. Take your appetizers up a notchTry this scrumptious and easy-to-prepare recipe from Katie Workman at TheMom100:Prosciutto-Wrapped Shrimp with Smoked PaprikaThese are lavish-looking appetizers suitable for any party or get-together with your family.Prep time 15 minutes; Cook time 6 minutes; Total time 21 minutesIngredients1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil1 and 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper1 pound jumbo shrimp (16/20 pound), shelled and deveined with tails left on4 ounces very thinly sliced prosciutto sliced lengthwise into 1/2-inch stripsInstructionsPreheat broiler and place cooking rack about 4 inches below heat source.

Whether a handcrafted toy, knitted scarf or jar of homemade treats, something you took the time to make means more than anything you could buy. Not too crafty?

But what hasn’t changed is the search for unique gift ideas — and fun new activities — to share with the ones we love, whether we’re together or apart.If you want to make an impression on your family and friends this year, it’s time to think outside the gift box. What can you do to make the holidays memorable for hard-to-shop-for relatives and friends? How can you find special new ways to connect with them, even from a distance?Here are a few ideas to get you started:1. Create a unique story, photo album or scrapbook projectWant to gift something truly special to an older relative, lifelong friend or a new couple just starting their journey together? Design and create a storybook highlighting a special time in your lives or showcasing how you met. Put together a photo album or make a scrapbook of shared memories you can send to someone as a memorable, one-of-a-kind keepsake.Collaborate with other friends or family members if you can — it will turn the project into a group experience you'll all treasure. Use mail, email or hand delivery to pass items along so everyone in your group can contribute before the completed project is ready for the recipient to enjoy.2. Share the gift of languageDo you have an aunt who’s always wanted to learn Italian, or maybe your dad loves to tell stories of his long-ago trip to Japan? Now’s the time to provide them with the opportunity to explore — or refresh — their language skills with an immersive language app like Rosetta Stone.Even better, make it a family affair! Giving a language-learning app to several family members is a great way to explore your family’s cultural heritage. It might even be the first step in a future trip together. As part of your gift, schedule virtual events to “meet up” and practice your language skills as you learn together.Rosetta Stone’s Dynamic Immersion approach ensures you’re immersed in your new language from the start, with reading, writing, listening and speaking exercises that work with the brain's natural language processing ability to help you learn fast. Their patented speech recognition engine helps you practice pronunciation, so you’ll have the confidence to speak in any situation. Helpful phrasebooks prepare you for the most commonly used phrases you'll need if you're traveling. It’s easy and convenient for users of all ages to begin learning on iPhone, iPad or Android.Visit rosettastone.com/gifts to give the gift of Rosetta Stone this holiday season.3. Explore the world of multi-player video gamesEven for people who think they don’t like video games, there’s a gaming experience out there for everyone. Plenty of family-friendly, multiplayer games can make for fun and memorable group activities for all ages.Try easy games involving scenarios that don’t require in-depth gaming knowledge or a long, complicated setup to get going. For example, games where you race alongside one another, manage a farm or build houses in a village full of talking animals have been popular in recent years. Games like these are low-stress ways to pass the time that can cross generations. And thanks to online features, many can easily be played together even if you’re far apart.4. Stream movies togetherThanks to today's technology, there are many ways to view family favorites or holiday classics together, even when you're not in the same room. Several movie streaming services and apps provide options for people to view the same content at the same time — some even allow you to see your viewing companion while you watch, just like you're in the same room. The only tricky part will be getting everyone’s bag of popcorn to pop simultaneously.If your friend or relative can’t stream with you, you can still make their holiday amazing. Just gift them a subscription to the service or show them how to set it up alongside yours. Making it work so you can enjoy a movie together will be the perfect gift to share.This holiday season, make your gifts all about creating quality time together — from anywhere and in any language!"

            "body": "As the weather turns colder and the season changes, your thoughts may be turning to the holidays and how you can make them extra special in this unique year.While many of us will be staying closer to home this holiday season, we'll still want to celebrate the season in style and create happy new memories with loved ones. Although a bit different, each moment this holiday season can still be savored and enjoyed with the delicious food you bring to your table.One choice sure to be appreciated by even the greatest gourmands is a cheeseboard curated with a selection of full-flavored artisanal cheeses. In fact, specialty cheeses have become so sought-after that the U.S. market is expected to grow by 2.5% in each of the next several years, reaching $18 billion by 2023.Many cheese lovers these days especially value the aged cheddars that are given the opportunity to evolve in quality and taste over time — just like fine wines. For example, over 110-year-old Oregon-based cheesemaker Tillamook, a farmer-owned co-op, has crafted a unique, aged Maker’s Reserve Extra Sharp White Cheddar line that features a line of vintages between 3 and 10 years old, each with their own distinct tasting notes and characteristics.“No one else in the industry looks at cheddar this way,” observes Rebekah Baker, an American Cheese Society Certified Cheese Professional who is Tillamook’s western regional specialty sales manager. “Cheese is a living thing that changes dramatically over time. By releasing vintages rather than static ages, we allow consumers to engage with the cheese across a range of ages and experience how it evolves over time.”However you plan to celebrate, you may wish to consider these suggestions for pulling together a delicious, impressive and beautiful holiday cheeseboard this season.Prepare for the perfect presentation Your awe-inspiring offering starts with a cheeseboard large enough to hold all the garnishes and other bounty you wish to add, while allowing enough room for creative design. Whether they’re made of wood, bamboo, steel, marble, glass, silicone or other materials, today’s boards are often art objects in and of themselves.Choose cheeses with unique flavor profiles Instead of grabbing something generic, look around for specialty selections that offer different and unexpected flavors and textures as well as complex pairings. For example, Tillamook's 2010 vintage is crumbly, packed with crystals, and smooth as velvet, with a bold, buttery, caramelly sweetness. The 2015 vintage combines a dry, crumbly texture with sweet top notes, bitter, citrusy undertones and a nutty finish. And the 2017 vintage is fresh, creamy and bright. Though complex in flavor, all Tillamook cheeses are made from only the highest quality milk and aged over time.Suggest tasty pairings A well-crafted cheese plate calls for other offerings that will complement your cheese selections in terms of taste, color and texture. For example, Tillamook's bold and buttery 2010 Makers’ Reserve can be especially delicious with strawberries, aged balsamic vinegar, oysters or crusty bread dipped in olive oil. The nuttiness of the 2015 vintage is a perfect offset to Marcona almonds, cured meats, smoked salmon, blood oranges and/or smoked honey. And the fruity, sweet-nosed 2017 vintage is scrumptious with citrus-marinated olives, almonds, honey, rosemary or oranges.Have fun with design Evaluate your selections, then assemble your board with an eye toward color, texture and taste. For example, you may wish to add your items by color, following the rainbow spectrum and moving from light shades to dark shades. Or you may want to create a flavor map, placing sweeter dessert-oriented items at one end and salty or savory items on the other. If you’re extra creative, you could suggest flavor pairings by dividing the board into visual thirds and placing complementary food choices close together. Remember to slice some of your cheeses and other foods before serving so your guests feel welcome to help themselves.With a little planning, you can pull together a beautiful and tasty holiday cheeseboard that will impress anyone. Ensure your cheese selections are the featured items on any cheeseboard layout and visit Tillamook.com to learn how and where you can find Tillamook Maker’s Reserve this holiday season."

It’s a little known fact that some employers often end up offering some seasonal workers a permanent role after the holidays are over.So whether you’re thinking of moving on from your current job, or you're out of work due to the pandemic, seasonal work can be a great way to get your foot in the door.If you’re interested in the idea of leveraging seasonal work into a meaningful career at a company with great benefits, here are some tips and insights to keep in mind as you start filling out those applications.Look beyond retail: Seasonal work offers opportunities that go well beyond operating a cash register. Many sectors are looking to add thousands to their payroll during the holidays, including transportation, manufacturing and package delivery. For example, did you know that UPS is currently filling over 100,000 jobs for the 2020 holiday season? In the past three years, about 35% of their seasonal employees ended up with permanent roles. So keep your eyes open, because you may discover possibilities you may not have considered.Make your intentions known: If you’re interested in making your seasonal job into something permanent, speak up. Tell your boss you’d love to stay on after the holidays. If they don’t know you’re interested, you may get overlooked when the perfect opportunity opens up. No need to constantly drop hints, but it’s important to raise your hand so they know to consider you.Give your best effort: Once you’re hired on, keep in mind your boss will be looking at the strongest candidates when it comes to offering permanent work. Do your best to show everyone that you’re a great employee and colleague. That means showing up on time, being willing to go above and beyond, and bringing a positive, can-do attitude to work every day.Make sure the job is right for you: Sometimes, when we’re job hunting, we lose sight of the fact that this is a time to test-drive a new role. That’s what makes seasonal work such a unique opportunity. If the company is evaluating you, it's just as important that you evaluate the company. Ask veterans what it's like to work there. Now's a good time to find out what they like about the work, along with any benefits the company offers, and how the company promotes a good quality of life.Looking for a job that pays great and has benefits such as health insurance, vacation time and pension benefits isn't easy. But for many workers, seasonal work can provide a path to bigger and better things.Just ask the 123,000 permanent UPS employees who started out in seasonal positions — about a third of their current workforce, including top managers and executives. Maybe you'll be one of them! Check out the opportunities at UPSJobs.com and apply today."

            "body": "Gathering around the table looks a lot different this year. From virtual toasts to strategically separated seating, winter’s hottest entertaining trend is the socially distanced dinner. But a little distance needn’t dim the glow of socializing, nor the eco-minded sensibility of sustainable choices.The coziest of gatherings are still centered around the joys of great company, delicious food and wine, and beautiful décor — no matter how far apart everyone sits. And, a virtual meal can still pull together stylish and sustainable elements that lessen the impact on the earth, while exuding grace and warmth.Set the table, set the toneA table that is equal parts welcoming and sustainable starts from the reclaimed wood up. It’s easy to green your winter table with simple eco-chic touches like an organic cotton runner or an upcycled centerpiece. Thoughtful elements made from sustainable materials, like reusable bamboo dinnerware or jute napkin rings, create a lovely, neutral palette. And if you’re using recycled glass for your stemware, why not fill it with earth-friendly wine?Swirl and sip sustainablyThanks to eco-conscious wineries who value sustainably grown fruit, what you pour may be the greenest element of your winter table. Here are three labels leading the sustainability charge, from California to Chile:Bonterra Organic Vineyards — American organic winery Bonterra began farming organically in 1987, decades before organic products became a mainstay of modern life. The team, led by Vineyard Director Joseph Brinkley, focuses on nurturing biodiversity, soil health and balance in the vineyards, all in the name of pure organic flavor in the glass. Instead of tractors, sheep mow the cover crops around Bonterra’s organically farmed vines in Mendocino County, California.Fetzer — An early pioneer of sustainable farming, Barney Fetzer founded his eponymous winery in 1968 and helped shape the quality and environmental consciousness of California wine. More than 50 years later, Fetzer is synonymous with classic American wines rooted in an abiding commitment to people and planet. Much of the fruit that goes into a bottle of Fetzer wine is sourced from certified sustainable vineyards throughout California.Cono Sur — Half a world away, Chile’s Cono Sur is an emblem of sustainable farming and winemaking in the Southern Hemisphere, with a dozen certified sustainable vineyards that dot the country’s vast north-south expanse. Nestled amid the first-ever Pinot Noir vines planted in Chile more than 50 years ago, Cono Sur is globally recognized for its Pinot Noir offerings.Here are some top picks for winter wines that check all the boxes: sustainably sourced, delightful on the palate and deliciously suited for hearty, cold-weather fare.Bonterra 2019 Chardonnay, CaliforniaBright stone fruit and citrus zest are framed by subtle notes of toasted oak and crème brûlée in this organically farmed California Chardonnay. A rich and creamy palate is balanced by uplifted acidity and clean minerality. A go-to white for roasted game.Fetzer 2019 Shaly Loam Gewürztraminer, Monterey CountyAmerica’s #1 Gewürztraminer lives up to its reputation with exotic notes of melon, rosewater, candied ginger and a touch of warm cinnamon spice. This sustainably sourced and fragrant white from the cool-climate vineyards of Monterey County is equally suited for a turkey feast or spicy pad Thai.Cono Sur 2018 Organico Pinot Noir, ChileCrafted from organically farmed, estate-grown fruit in Colchagua Valley and San Antonio Valley, this medium-bodied Pinot Noir delivers intense wild fruit aromas of cherry and raspberry, layered over nuanced notes of toasted oak. Sip this elegant red with poached salmon, roasted duck or a nutty Gruyère cheese.Bonterra 2018 Merlot, CaliforniaRipe fruit notes of strawberry and pomegranate are framed by a subtle suggestion of dried herbs. Elegant tannins and a smooth finish make this organically farmed, robust red a winter favorite. Pour it alongside braised meat or tomato pasta.No matter how your gatherings take shape this winter — from a few people at the table to a few households connected by virtual screens — you can still embrace all the elements that matter most: the people you love, memorable conversations, delicious food and wine, and sustainable style."

Here are three labels leading the sustainability charge, from California to Chile:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.bonterra.com/our-commitments/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bonterra Organic Vineyards</a> — American organic winery Bonterra began farming organically in 1987, decades before organic products became a mainstay of modern life. The team, led by Vineyard Director Joseph Brinkley, focuses on nurturing biodiversity, soil health and balance in the vineyards, all in the name of pure organic flavor in the glass. Instead of tractors, sheep mow the cover crops around Bonterra’s organically farmed vines in Mendocino County, California.</p><p><a href=\"https://fetzer.com/about/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fetzer</a> — An early pioneer of sustainable farming, Barney Fetzer founded his eponymous winery in 1968 and helped shape the quality and environmental consciousness of California wine. More than 50 years later, Fetzer is synonymous with classic American wines rooted in an abiding commitment to people and planet. Much of the fruit that goes into a bottle of Fetzer wine is sourced from certified sustainable vineyards throughout California.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.conosur.com/en/sustentabilidad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cono Sur</a> — Half a world away, Chile’s Cono Sur is an emblem of sustainable farming and winemaking in the Southern Hemisphere, with a dozen certified sustainable vineyards that dot the country’s vast north-south expanse. Nestled amid the first-ever Pinot Noir vines planted in Chile more than 50 years ago, Cono Sur is globally recognized for its Pinot Noir offerings.</p><p>Here are some top picks for winter wines that check all the boxes: sustainably sourced, delightful on the palate and deliciously suited for hearty, cold-weather fare.</p><p><strong>Bonterra 2019 Chardonnay, California</strong></p><p>Bright stone fruit and citrus zest are framed by subtle notes of toasted oak and crème brûlée in this organically farmed California Chardonnay. A rich and creamy palate is balanced by uplifted acidity and clean minerality. A go-to white for roasted game.</p><p><strong>Fetzer 2019 Shaly Loam Gew</strong><strong>ürztraminer, Monterey County</strong></p><p>America’s #1 Gewürztraminer lives up to its reputation with exotic notes of melon, rosewater, candied ginger and a touch of warm cinnamon spice. This sustainably sourced and fragrant white from the cool-climate vineyards of Monterey County is equally suited for a turkey feast or spicy pad Thai.</p><p><strong>Cono Sur 2018 Organico Pinot Noir, Chile</strong></p><p>Crafted from organically farmed, estate-grown fruit in Colchagua Valley and San Antonio Valley, this medium-bodied Pinot Noir delivers intense wild fruit aromas of cherry and raspberry, layered over nuanced notes of toasted oak. Sip this elegant red with poached salmon, roasted duck or a nutty Gruyère cheese.</p><p><strong>Bonterra 2018 Merlot, California</strong></p><p>Ripe fruit notes of strawberry and pomegranate are framed by a subtle suggestion of dried herbs. Elegant tannins and a smooth finish make this organically farmed, robust red a winter favorite. Pour it alongside braised meat or tomato pasta.</p><p>No matter how your gatherings take shape this winter — from a few people at the table to a few households connected by virtual screens — you can still embrace all the elements that matter most: the people you love, memorable conversations, delicious food and wine, and sustainable style.</p>",

            "body": "One good thing about 2020? More people are fostering and adopting pets who need homes. And during the holidays, pet adoption increases even more because families have more time away from work and school.Before you foster or adopt — and especially when considering a pet as a gift — it’s best to make sure you’re ready not just for the fun and companionship pets can bring, but also for the responsibilities. Preparing thoughtfully in advance will ensure you and your new pet are happy and comfortable at home.“This year has been so unexpected, but one constant is that animals always bring positivity and comfort,” says veterinarian Dr. Marty Becker, founder and CEO of Fear Free, in partnership with BISSELL. “If you’re preparing to adopt or foster a pet, it’s important to ease their transition into your home.”Here are questions to ask before bringing a new furry friend home.1. Does your living situation allow pets?If you live in a rental, there are likely animal rules. Even if pets are allowed, additional fees might be added to help pay for possible damage or cleaning. Be sure to identify any such limitations before adopting or fostering a pet.Also, make sure there's room for your pet to have their own space. “One immediate change you can make in your home is to create a dedicated space for your new pet with bedding, food, water and toys to help them feel safe,” recommends Becker.2. Do you have everything you need?With pets come supplies: food and dishes, toys, bedding, litter boxes (for cats), leashes (for dogs), plus cleaning supplies. Make sure you're prepared with enough funds to support the ongoing needs of your four-legged pal.One crucial way to prepare your home for a new pet is to have effective cleaning tools on hand so you can spend less time cleaning and more time with your pet! Getting a BISSELL® CrossWave® Cordless Max multi-surface wet/dry vac is a great first step — it vacuums and washes sealed hard floors at the same time, making it easier and quicker to keep floors clean. Especially during this season, there are a variety of formulas you can use in this wet/dry vacuum that adapt to your cleaning needs, including sanitizing hard floors, cleaning your delicate wood floors, or cleaning multi-surfaces, like sealed hard floors and refreshing your area rugs.The BISSELL® CrossWave® Cordless Max gives you cordless freedom, and its rechargeable battery provides up to 30 minutes of cleaning power, depending on mode and usage. The machine’s self-cleaning cycle cleans the brush roll after each use, so all you have to do is dump and rinse the dirty water tank.BISSELL also proudly supports BISSELL Pet Foundation and its mission to help save homeless pets, and when you buy one of their products, you help save pets, too.3. Will you have time to spend with your pet?Now it may feel like you have plenty of time to take walks, play with pets and cuddle, especially while family members are working and learning at home. However, since we might not always be remote, it’s important to plan for changes in schedules down the road.Will there be time in your family’s schedule in the future, so your pet will have all of their needs met — including companionship and attention? Consider adding special comfy beds or leaving a radio on to help your pet adjust to being home alone. Get them gradually used to being on their own by taking short outings without them — leading up to the time when family members need to return to the workplace.4. Can you create a relationship with a veterinarian? If you don’t already have a veterinarian in mind, start looking for one in your area. Ask pet-loving friends, neighbors and family for recommendations. Neighborhood social media groups often have great suggestions, too. Once you find a vet, call ahead to inquire about wellness visits, and establish a relationship so you’re prepared.Becker offers tips during this time when vet offices are not allowing pet parents to enter with pets: “As you’re preparing for any of those first veterinarian appointments, I recommend bringing a comforting toy or blanket from home to help reduce anxiety.”For help finding a vet, prepping for vet visits and other advice, visit FearFreeHappyHomes.com.Spending time preparing now will create more time to relax and play with your new best friend later. Being a pet parent is a rewarding gift — especially now — because it offers opportunities to increase your capacity for responsibility, compassion and play. And if you’re fostering, you’ll have the special opportunity to prepare a pet for their future forever home."

            "body": "Struggling to shop for that picky colleague, or your friend who’s already bought themselves everything? Looking for a stress-free and undeniably delicious snack for your low-key holiday get-together? Or do you simply want to kick grandma’s recipes up a notch this year? The solution is simple: cheese. Not just any cheese; nice cheese.Cheese makes everything — even 2020 — better. That’s why Josh Gentine, a third-generation member of the Sargento Foods legacy, founded The Big Cheese Co. Well, that, and he stumbled upon 850,000 pounds of extra-sharp, 12- to 15-year aged cheddar in Wisconsin. According to Gentine, cheese ages like fine wine, getting sharper and more complex with each passing year. He maintains his cheddar is “the sharpest you’ve ever tasted,” adding jokingly, “It’s so sharp it has a British accent.”With that in mind, here are three tips for making this holiday the cheesiest one ever.Tip 1: Unwrap flavorCheese is the perfect gift. “Cheese is our common denominator,” says Gentine. “There are only two types of people in this world: people who already love cheese and people who need to try The Big Cheese.”With The Big Cheese, blocks are sent directly to your doorstep, so you can cross everyone off your gift list without leaving the sofa. A 2.5-pound block to your foodie aunt, a 5-pounder to the family of four. A 40-pound behemoth sent directly to the door of your friend who’s always entertaining (or will be, once that's safe again). It’s an unexpected gift that you can be confident will be enjoyed and not regifted or left to gather dust in a hallway closet.Tip 2: Charcuterie championCharcuterie boards have blossomed into their own popular subgenre of #foodporn on Instagram. It’s becoming a full-fledged movement, with people creating over-the-top, picture-perfect trays packed with premium deli and dairy. The art of the board is all about balance, in both color and flavor. Put your folded, reddish cuts of cured meat opposite pale cheeses, next to green olives or grape garnish. Mix and match an assortment of hard and soft cheeses with tapenades and spreads. Temper the salty meats with sweeter fruits like pears or apples. With charcuterie, your guest becomes the chef, piling up a plate the way they like it, so you’ve got to give them options.Pro Pointer: Serve your extra-sharp, aged cheddar (and other cheeses) at room temperature. When cheese is too cold, its taste is muted. By allowing cheese to come to room temperature, you’re allowing its flavors to come out and join the party.Tip 3: Sharpen a family favoriteThis holiday isn’t like any other, so why not put a twist on old traditions? Family recipes that stay the same year after year can become tired or stale, so add a little zing with a cheesy kick. The secret is the sharp cheddar. Adding shreds of the zesty treat brings more complexity to dishes. It’s the perfect way to amp up mac and cheese, bring extra creaminess to grits or polenta, elevate a grilled cheese sandwich or breathe second life into leftovers like turkey melts.Try this recipe for a great new take on a family classic:The Big Cheese Mac &amp; CheeseFrom Jessica Slomberg @NYCFoodComaIngredients:1½ cups half-and-half16 ounces cream cheese, cubed2 cups extra-sharp aged cheddar from The Big Cheese, coarsely grated1 pound radiatori pasta (or any fun pasta shape!)Directions:Bring large pot of water to a boil. Once water is boiling, add plenty of salt and 1 pound radiatori pasta. Cook until pasta is al dente (5-10 minutes depending on type of pasta). While pasta is boiling, add ½ cup half and half to a separate large pot or saucepan and reduce about 15 minutes over low heat.Once cream is reduced, whisk in 16 ounces cream cheese cubes until smooth, then add 2 cups of The Big Cheese. Continue whisking until smooth.When pasta is cooked, strain and transfer to pot containing creamy cheese mixture. Mix until pasta is evenly coated and serve.Visit TheBigCheese.com to stock up on the limited-supply of extra-sharp cheddar and ship savory gifts to friends and family."

But while you’re staying at home and doing your best to be safe during a pandemic, there’s one thing you shouldn’t have to compromise on — high-quality wine. And if you’re a seasoned wine drinker, you know that Napa Valley is the place to be.“Napa Valley’s reputation is globally recognized, but its output is remarkably small,” says Elizabeth Vianna, winemaker at Chimney Rock Winery. “We produce only 4% of California’s total wine production, but that 4% represents the very best California has to offer.”So, if you can’t have a travel adventure for the holidays this year, Napa Valley can come to you. Here’s how to bring a little luxury to your life and experience wine country without ever leaving your home.1. Set the mood with musicTurn up the music and get ready to relax. Choose your go-to wine tasting playlist or search for one that’s already been created wherever you listen to music. It’s all about what gets you in the wine-tasting mood.2. Try a virtual tastingEscape to wine country with a virtual visit to prestigious Napa Valley wineries. For example, Wine.com is hosting 'A Toast to Napa Valley' — a free virtual wine tasting event featuring some of Napa’s most acclaimed wine producers. You can even purchase wine to taste during the session that will be shipped directly to your home or can be sent to a loved one as a holiday gift. To sign up and get your wine for the tasting, go to wine.com. The session will be on the Wine.com website for several months. This is a great way to share a common experience with friends and family tuning in at the same time, all from the safety of your own home.3. Treat yourself to a cinematic getawayWine and film share a profound link: the ability of a single sip or scene to whisk your senses away to a wholly different time and place. After all: Wine, popcorn and a good movie makes for a great time, any night of the week.

Get cookingIf you were really exploring Napa Valley, you’d be feasting on fresh, local fare for every meal. For your Napa day at home, consider this sublime recipe for grilled New York Steak with Porcini Mushroom Butter from prominent wine country chef Colin Crowley. Whatever you choose to cook or order in from your favorite restaurant, don’t forget to select wines that pair well with your food choices.5. Treat yourself to a spa nightBefore your dream day at home comes to a close, rest and recover with a little spa time. Light a candle, put on a different kind of face mask, pour yourself a glass of Chimney Rock Cabernet and hop into a steaming tub of bubbly water to soothe sore muscles and promote a restful night of sleep — and dream of a day where you can enjoy wine country in person. It’s the perfect cap to your Napa-themed day.Grilled New York Steak with Porcini Butter (Serves 6)1 C.

            "title": "7 trending reasons why Sherry is ideal for winter celebrations",
            "author": "BrandPoint",

            "body": "Sherry is a classic wine that's been around for hundreds of years, yet is recently receiving renewed interest among people of all ages and is being embraced in new and inventive ways. Sherry isn't just great for sipping — it has loads of potential as a cocktail ingredient and more, making it a wonderful option for winter celebrations.The best-selling Sherry in the world is Harveys Bristol Cream, the only Spanish product with a Royal Warrant from the British Royal Family. Produced from four different styles of Sherry — Fino, Amontillado, Oloroso and Pedro Ximenez — it's one of the most versatile Sherries around, a testament to its best-selling status. In fact, here are seven reasons to enjoy Harveys this winter that showcase why Sherry is experiencing a rebirth.Sherry keeps for a month refrigerated: When properly chilled, many Sherry styles, such as Harveys, can stay good for up to a month. This means you don't need a big group or special occasion to keep a bottle on hand. For proper storage, keep the bottle closed and in a refrigerator when not being used. This helps the Sherry maintain its incredible flavor.Pair Sherry with snacks like nuts: Winter celebrations often call for a variety of nuts for snacking. Whether they are sweet, spiced or raw in their shell waiting for cracking, Sherry is the perfect pairing for nuts. In fact, Sherry can be a tasty aperitif with nuts or other light appetizers to start a meal.Sherry can be used as a baking ingredient: You can use Sherry in traditional winter recipes such as pumpkin pie, spice cookies or fruit cake. Recipes for Sherry brownies are indulgent and the perfect ending to a meal. Of course, pair these rich treats with a glass of Sherry to delight the palate.Sherry can be used as a cooking ingredient: Add interest and depth to sauces with Sherry. A splash of Sherry increases flavor when sauteing meats or vegetables. Need to deglaze your pan? A bit of Sherry helps those crispy flavors at the bottom of the pan to release and is an easy way to make a quick pan sauce for meat or seafood.Serving Sherry is simple: Just like any other wine, Sherry can be enjoyed straight.

            "html": "<p>Sherry is a classic wine that's been around for hundreds of years, yet is recently receiving renewed interest among people of all ages and is being embraced in new and inventive ways. Sherry isn't just great for sipping — it has loads of potential as a cocktail ingredient and more, making it a wonderful option for winter celebrations.</p><p>The best-selling Sherry in the world is <a href=\"https://harveyssherry.com/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Harveys Bristol Cream</a>, the only Spanish product with a Royal Warrant from the British Royal Family. Produced from four different styles of Sherry — Fino, Amontillado, Oloroso and Pedro Ximenez — it's one of the most versatile Sherries around, a testament to its best-selling status. In fact, here are seven reasons to enjoy Harveys this winter that showcase why Sherry is experiencing a rebirth.</p><p><strong>Sherry keeps for a month refrigerated:</strong> When properly chilled, many Sherry styles, such as Harveys, can stay good for up to a month. This means you don't need a big group or special occasion to keep a bottle on hand. For proper storage, keep the bottle closed and in a refrigerator when not being used. This helps the Sherry maintain its incredible flavor.</p><p><strong>Pair Sherry with snacks like nuts:</strong> Winter celebrations often call for a variety of nuts for snacking. Whether they are sweet, spiced or raw in their shell waiting for cracking, Sherry is the perfect pairing for nuts. In fact, Sherry can be a tasty aperitif with nuts or other light appetizers to start a meal.</p><p><strong>Sherry can be used as a baking ingredient:</strong> You can use Sherry in traditional winter recipes such as pumpkin pie, spice cookies or fruit cake. Recipes for <a href=\"https://harveyssherry.com/food-pairings.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sherry brownies</a> are indulgent and the perfect ending to a meal. Of course, pair these rich treats with a glass of Sherry to delight the palate.</p><p><strong>Sherry can be used as a cooking ingredient:</strong> Add interest and depth to sauces with Sherry. A splash of Sherry increases flavor when sauteing meats or vegetables. Need to deglaze your pan? A bit of Sherry helps those crispy flavors at the bottom of the pan to release and is an easy way to make a quick pan sauce for meat or seafood.</p><p><strong>Serving Sherry is simple:</strong> Just like any other wine, Sherry can be enjoyed straight. Chill the Harveys bottle and the label tells you when it’s ready by turning blue. Try enjoying it chilled over ice with a slice of orange. You don’t need special glassware; a regular white or red wine glass is ideal for Sherry.<span style=\"color: #500050; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 16px;\"></span></p><p><strong>Sherry is a versatile cocktail substitute: </strong>Have fun swapping in Sherry for other spirits to create flavorful cocktails that often have lower alcohol by volume.

With the changing of seasons, it’s time to bring brunch back to create warm memories as the weather cools.

From creating a beautiful tablescape and ambiance to pairing Insta-worthy drinks and dishes, insights from expert entertainers will help you create the ultimate elevated brunch experience.Do your prep workTo avoid a last-minute time crunch, make a plan. Nail down your menu and shop for the essentials a few days in advance of your soiree; make a quick shopping trip or online grocery order the day before for items that are best purchased super fresh. Also the day before, take care of as much slicing, chopping and assembling as you can, and start laying the foundation for your gorgeous table by setting out your linens, china and glassware. Pull out any other kitchen tools, serving ware and essentials you may need. The more you can do ahead of time, the more energy you’ll have to welcome and attend to your brunch guests, whether virtually or in person from a safe distance.Create fun and functional centerpiecesCreating a chic table doesn’t need to be complicated or break the bank. You can create a stunning look with flavors you’ll be featuring in your menu. Fill small vases with overflowing aromatics and herbs that accent dishes or garnish cocktails — think fresh mint, thyme or lavender. Use glass pitchers to showcase other key accouterments, such as sliced or whole lemons, limes, oranges and berries. This hack adds bursts of vibrant color indoors or out, while getting your guests involved in crafting and customizing their own drinks.

Whether guests are joining in person or virtually, an elegant and effervescent drink helps elevate the occasion. For your next 21-and-older get-together*, the Lillet Spritz is a simple and ideal accompaniment to any brunch menu. With low alcohol by volume, this light and refreshing concoction is perfect for sipping during daytime festivities. Just mix three ounces of Lillet (Blanc or Rosé) with three ounces of tonic water over large ice cubes in a tall wine glass, and garnish with cucumber, mint and a strawberry.Pay attention to pairingsWhen deciding on a menu, think about how each dish will work with your accompanying beverages. Look for combinations that will complement one another, provide balance or highlight nuances you want to bring out in your culinary creations. For instance, the classic Lillet can draw attention to the hint of citrus and aromatics in baked doughnuts topped with a Lillet Rosé glaze — even better, these easy-to-make show-stoppers from Vallery Lomas, cookbook author and Great American Baking Show winner, can be prepared in advance.When keeping these expert tips in mind, hosting a simple yet chic brunch experience in your home, on your deck or in your garden is within easy reach.

            "body": "Since spending more time at home, you’ve probably started eyeing projects that need attention. If so, you’re not alone — Houzz home renovation website reported a 58% increase in leads for home improvement professionals this past summer.One project that can make an impact on the look and value of your home is refinishing your hardwood floors. It may seem like a big project to tackle, but refinishing can not only improve the look and value of your home but will extend the lifespan of your floors.Here are a few tips to get the job done right:1. Choose carefullyDo your research. Since floors comprise one of the largest surfaces in your home, you want them to look great and wear well for years to come.Consider the room's overall aesthetic such as color palette and light. A darker space could benefit from lighter colored floors, while darker floors can add rich contrast. In addition to color, pay attention to the variety of floor finish sheens, which can range from extra glossy to super matte.Don't forget to account for other room changes you’re planning such as wall color, window treatments or furnishings.2. Use a professionalWhile you may be handy around the house, this is one area where you don’t want to make costly mistakes. Hiring a qualified professional flooring craftsman will save time and could also save you money. DIY floor refinishing mistakes are difficult to repair and may mean replacing the flooring surface all together. Consult an expert such as a Bona Certified Craftsman to ensure your floors are refinished with the best products and tools to safeguard the health of your home.3. Think environmentally friendlyWhen it comes to a hardwood floor finish, the best choice for keeping your home free of toxins is a water-based or waterborne finish.The three most common hardwood floor finish choices are — acid cured (also called Swedish finish), oil-based polyurethane or waterborne. Acid cured is high in volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and is even outlawed in some regions. Because of its toxic nature, homeowners, pets, food, houseplants and even fish tanks must be removed from the home during the refinishing process to keep them safe. Even after the homeowner’s return, this floor finish will continue to release toxins into the home.Oil-based polyurethane floor finish also emits a high level of VOCs creating an intense smell. Additionally, it can have an extended drying time (making your flooring project take longer) and over time, the color can turn yellow compromising the original floor color you selected.By contrast, waterborne finishes are durable, sustainable and safe enough for homeowners, pets, plants and food to remain in the home during the entire refinishing process. A waterborne finish may take a few hours more to dry than acid cure finish, but it will be ready to walk on hours before an oil-based polyurethane finish. The environmental and health benefits are also well worth it. A high-durability waterborne finish like Bona Traffic HD has low VOCs and is Greenguard Gold certified, ensuring that your finish looks beautiful and will keep your home healthy.'Hardwood floor refinishing has come a long way from 10 or 15 years ago,' said Kenny Boggs, Jr. of of CHP Inc., a Chesapeake, VA-based hardwood floor installation and renovation company. 'With low VOC waterborne finishes, environmentally friendly sealers, and dust containment systems, the refinishing process will only leave a beautiful floor behind.'Finally, ask your flooring craftsman to use a dust containment system to further protect your home from potentially harmful dust, while also making clean-up a breeze.4. Let the floors unify your spaceDesigners often select the same flooring throughout several rooms, especially on one level of a home, to connect the spaces visually. If you have other rooms on the same level that aren’t hardwood, see if there is hardwood under those other surfaces that could be refinished to create a unified look, or consider if installing hardwood floors would be worth the investment.5. Keep them cleanOnce the floors are refinished, cleaning and protecting your hardwood floors is essential. Ask your flooring craftsman to recommend products that will keep your newly refinished floors in great condition. The right floor care after refinishing will help keep your home looking beautiful for years.Follow these tips to keep your hardwood floors looking their best. Consult a Bona Certified Craftsman at bona.com/bcc for expert advice on achieving beautiful floors that will last a lifetime."

            "body": "If you’re gearing up for a fall getaway or looking to use some of your remaining vacation days this year, Florida has plenty of family-friendly, affordable options for you to consider. These six Florida destinations should be at the top of your list, since they’re known for their amazing scenery, exhilarating atmosphere and excellent accommodations all year long.Pensacola BeachThe westernmost city in the Florida Panhandle, Pensacola offers mild temperatures year-round. The sugar-white beaches and turquoise waters that greet visitors in “the City of Five Flags” are fabulously pristine, and the local restaurant scene will tantalize your taste buds. History buffs will love exploring downtown Pensacola — historic sites like Fort Pickens or the Naval Air Station Pensacola are well worth checking out.Consider staying at the Holiday Inn Resort Pensacola Beach, a kid-friendly beachfront hotel with multiple pools, a lazy river and stunning views of the Gulf of Mexico. Say “cheers” at the beachfront tiki bar, book a local excursion or get your seafood fix at the hotel’s restaurant.Panama City BeachFlorida's Emerald Coast starts at Pensacola and stretches east along the Gulf to Panama City Beach, a destination that’s a treasure trove of family fun. Spend the day splashing in the water and building sandcastles along the shore. Or rent a Jet Ski for a shot of adrenaline. Or head out on a boat for some serious fishing. Then relax on one of the piers as you soak in the sunset. Don't leave the area without checking out Shell Island, a 7-mile-long, undeveloped barrier island perfect for shell collecting and spotting coastal creatures in their natural habitat.For travelers seeking a beachfront hotel in a prime location, the recently opened SpringHill Suites Panama City Beach Beachfront is a great choice. Set right alongside the beach, this property features an outdoor pool with a lazy river and picturesque views of the Gulf.Amelia IslandOn Florida’s Atlantic coast, head to Amelia Island, part of the Southeast’s Sea Islands chain of barrier islands. With postcard-worthy beaches and impressively tall sand dunes, Amelia Island is a dream escape for people of all ages. Besides basking along the beach, visitors can hit the links for some golf, visit the Palace Station Bar and have a chat with the bartender — or even the mayor, enjoy the fine dining options in town, and explore some American history at the Civil War-era Fort Clinch State Park.The Seaside Amelia Inn is a hidden gem just steps away from a secluded beach. This delightful boutique hotel comes at an affordable rate during any season and offers complimentary beach chair and bike rentals.SarasotaAn hour’s drive south of Tampa is Sarasota, with its own bounty of cultural offerings and lovely, sandy beaches that have earned their own renown. While here, you’ll want to make time to absorb the natural beauty of the Marie Selby Botanical Gardens.For an upgraded experience, stay at the Embassy Suites by Hilton Sarasota, an all-suite hotel within walking distance of downtown’s lively Main Street corridor. Embassy Suites is also home to Bridges Restaurant, which has floor-to-ceiling windows that provide spectacular views of the Sarasota Bay and skyline in a comfortable and elegant dining room. In addition to taking in the views, you can enjoy a thoughtfully crafted meal with local ingredients prepared by a 5-star chef.Cocoa BeachOn the other side of the state is Florida’s Space Coast, which includes scenic Cocoa Beach, also known as the East Coast surfing capital of the U.S. Cocoa Beach has no shortage of activities, from Ron Jon Surf Shop to the Brevard Zoo. Adventure lovers can jam-pack their days with endeavors or beach bums can sit back and relax in the sand.Beachside Hotel &amp; Suites — a newly renovated boutique hotel — is the place to stay on Cocoa Beach. Its relaxed, retro vibe instantly puts you into vacation mode. Amenities include free beach toys, a lazy river and a poolside bar.Fort Walton BeachBack on the Florida Panhandle, Fort Walton Beach is a small town with big charm. The glittering waters and soft sand make this area idyllic, and there’s plenty more in store beyond the shore. When you visit, drop by the Gulfarium Marine Adventure Park, where you can see dolphins, penguins and alligators.When considering where to stay, check out the Hilton Garden Inn Fort Walton Beach. Nestled oceanside, this hotel features a pool, lazy river, tropical tiki bar and direct access to the beach. The enclosed courtyard and fire pits are perfect for getting cozy during cooler months."

            "body": "With temperatures cooling and leaves changing from golden yellow to deep auburn, there’s no denying that it’s the season of all things cozy and comfy. And as you begin to hunker down and bundle up indoors, the thought of embarking on a deck building project might not be top of mind.While home improvement retailers position transitional months as “off-season” for outdoor projects, industry insiders know there are advantages to beginning deck construction once temperate weather days arrive. From scoring a deal on building materials to booking the most in-demand builder, here are three ways you can build your dream deck under budget and in record time this off-season.1. Book best-in-class building professionals when they’re availableSince spring and summer are the busiest times of year for contractors and building professionals, you’ll have a better chance of booking the most in-demand deck builder in your community during transitional months. With summer projects wrapped up, workloads are naturally lighter. As a result, deck contractors have more flexibility in their schedules and can see a project through from start to finish much quicker than when they’re juggling multiple builds. They’ll also have a better chance of securing necessary building permits on a quick turnaround. With fewer permit applications in the queue for local government officials’ review, there should be fewer delays in the permitting process.2. Take advantage of seasonal savings to stretch your dollar furtherContractors and decking brands alike offer homeowners plenty of incentives to take advantage of during transitional seasons. For example, building professionals may offer reduced rates to fill gaps in their schedules. Home improvement and decking brands, like most retailers, offer competitively priced products around the holiday season to reduce inventory and make room for new products. Taking advantage of these savings opportunities can substantially lower upfront costs associated with building a deck. The best part? Now you can splurge on stylish accessories like railing post caps or LED lights … and still stay within budget.3. Preserve your beautiful lawn and then “spring” into landscaping projectsDeck construction can take a toll on landscaping, particularly during prime building season. In the spring, lawns tend to hold more moisture as the ground beneath begins to thaw. As a result, the ground can become increasingly soggy and is primed to muddy up shoes and retain unsightly footprints. What’s more, grass and flowers are just beginning to reemerge after winter. With increased foot traffic from builders coming and going, there’s also the risk of accidentally damaging budding flora. Rather than disrupt spring and summer’s bloom, schedule deck construction when your yard is already gearing up for its annual hibernation. Since many plants go dormant as the air cools and the ground freezes, it’s one of the best times to build a deck without significantly impacting landscaping. By the time warm weather rolls back around, you’ll be ready to tackle landscaping projects surrounding your beautiful new deck.To create an outdoor space you can start enjoying now, consider building materials that will help extend your deck’s open-air season. For example, bamboo composite deck boards and light-gauge steel frames are resilient, durable and generally low maintenance.“When composite decking is coupled with steel framing, it forms a durable deck system that’s well-equipped to host year-round and designed to last decades longer than lumber,” said Toby Bostwick, VP of Product and Brand, Fortress Building Products. “Composite deck boards provide benefits like slip- and moisture-resistance to not only keep deck systems looking great year-round, but also make them safer to enjoy during any season.”If you’re feeling inspired to “deck out” your backyard and savor more days spent outdoors, take note of the time and money-saving ways to tackle deck construction during the off-season."

            "body": "When checking your holiday list, you’re searching for gifts that inspire joy and delight, and electronic items often fit that description. But what if that gift also happens to have a positive impact on the recipient’s life and the world at large? In these difficult times, many of us have a greater appreciation for the things that protect the health of the planet for everyone.Whether you’re shopping for a shiny new appliance or gadgets to make someone's life easier during quarantine, here's how your gift can do a world of good: Look for products that have earned the ENERGY STAR label. These are independently certified to use less energy than standard products, which means energy bill savings and a cleaner environment.To inspire you, here are a few holiday shopping list ideas:Cool savings on the hottest electronic devices: Did you know the average household owns 24 consumer electronics products? The more you invest in items designed to save energy, the more the savings will rack up. That's especially important now, as families use multiple electronics for work and school. For catching up on favorite shows during times of social distancing, tablets use four times less energy than streaming to a laptop and 15 times less than a desktop computer. An energy-efficient sound bar offers a sleek solution to achieving that rich stereo effect, but uses 70% less energy than a conventional model.A smarter solution to save heating costs: Now that more people are spending time at home, they’re spending less on dining and gasoline. However, home energy costs have definitely skyrocketed. Smart thermostats take the guesswork out of maximizing energy efficiency, and choosing an ENERGY STAR certified smart thermostat means savings you can trust. Were everyone to make the switch, we’d save 56 trillion BTUs of energy and $740 million a year, offsetting 13 billion pounds of annual greenhouse gas emissions.Appliances with noticeable cost savings: Even when the purchase price is nice, don’t overlook this hidden cost of owning appliances: The cost of operating the product. So, if you’re eyeing a new washer dryer set as the perfect holiday gift, make sure it’s energy efficient. You’ll feel good helping your loved one realize more than 20% savings on their electric bill while using one-third less water compared to the standard models.A bright idea for stocking stuffers: Here’s a small gift that can light up their lives and save some serious bucks. A single energy-efficient light bulb can save more than $50 in electricity costs over its lifetime. If each American home replaced just a single bulb to one that earned the ENERGY STAR certification, we’d prevent more than 7 billion pounds of greenhouse gas emissions. Now that you know how ENERGY STAR-certified appliances and devices can do a world of good, for the recipient as well as our planet, be sure and check out the handy gift guide by visiting energystar.gov/holiday."

Whether you need a place to take a break from daily stressors, get some work done, or host friends and family, look no further than your own garage.For many, the garage is simply a place to park the car, store tools and bikes, and hide old toys or off-season items that have no other place to go. But with a few easy upgrades, you can turn the garage into a productive, fun-filled place. Here are five tips to get you started.Clean and organizeThe first step is to look at the current state of your garage. To make the best of your space, you’ll need to start with a blank canvas. Do a deep clean, take stock of your tools and consider new ways to store and organize them. Building custom shelves to get your equipment up off the floor will not only give you a new project to take on, but it will help clear the way for a place where you can be productive and get jobs done. One key item to have in your upgraded garage shop is a Portable Electric Air Compressor, which can be used for power nailers, sanders, paint spray guns and much more — plus, at less powerful settings, it can even be used to quickly blow away dust and debris.Heat it upCreating a year-round garage to enjoy will mean you’ll have to take the extra step to ensure the walls and ceilings are insulated correctly. For extra warmth, use a workshop heater like the Mr. Heater Big Maxx Garage Heater from Northern Tool + Equipment. A heater this size can easily warm up a two- or three-car garage, allowing you to work and play comfortably in your space no matter the outside temperature.Let in the lightSwitching up the lighting is an easy and inexpensive way to update your garage. Most garages have just one or two light bulbs hanging from the ceiling, but you’ll want more than that for your new, useful space. Try an industrial-style light fixture or customizable, sleek track lighting to make the room feel more inviting to friends for casual hang-outs. Plus, it'll be easier to see when you're working on projects.Bring on the entertainmentTo get the most out of your new garage, make sure it is all about entertainment. Think about how you’ll be using the space. The garage is a great place to hang a TV for football Sundays and video games. Adding extra speakers can provide a complete experience, whether it’s watching the game or listening to music while you work on your latest project. If you plan on hosting regular game nights, fill the room with a poker or ping-pong table that can be easily folded up when not being used.Get comfortableOne of the most important parts of your new garage space is seating. Whether you go with recliners, a sofa, stools or a combination of all three, look for furniture that fits your space. Find pieces that let you get comfortable, can stand being outdoors and are versatile. Leather is a classic material plus it’s easy to clean and maintain. For another way to add comfort — and more entertainment possibilities — set up a side bar with a refrigerator to keep cool drinks and snacks at hand.With these ideas as your playbook, you’re now ready to achieve garage greatness."

Studies show that 72% of second-time home buyers consider a workable laundry room an essential feature of their homes.Fortunately, there are options to make your existing laundry room more functional without having to tackle any renovations. Consider how these changes could make your laundry space more comfortable, convenient and easy to use:1) Add storage spaceIf you’re constantly juggling detergents and ineffectively trying to separate your dirty and clean laundry, try installing utilitarian shelving and/or cabinetry that provide bigger, better storage. Through smart design, you may be able to incorporate good-sized laundry bins, racks for hanging wet clothes and/or countertops that can hold your folded laundry before it’s put away. If you have the space, an island that provides storage in the middle of the space is another option. Households with children may benefit from storage spaces where potentially harmful chemicals like bleach can be safely locked away.2) Reconfigure your washer and dryerCould a vertically stacked washer and dryer make your laundry processes easier and more efficient? Perhaps if they’re made by appliance specialist LG Electronics. LG’s sleek single-unit LG WashTower takes up half the floor space in your laundry room while tackling ultra-large loads. Further, LG’s exclusive Center Control™ panel is perfectly positioned for easy, ergonomic use, putting the machines’ top-of-the-line innovations and advanced cleaning power at your fingertips. Bonus? Both the washer and dryer offer extra-large capacity for all your laundry needs.3) Upgrade your lightingGet rid of dim lighting that makes it hard to spot stains and sort laundry with brighter, more attractive lighting that makes the room more appealing and functional. Recessed fluorescent or LED troffers and flush-mount fixtures may help preserve your ceiling space. Aim for the equivalent of 75 watts of light for a comfortable but pleasingly bright effect.4) Consider fold-out optionsIf you lack the room to incorporate more storage, another option may be smartly designed tables and/or an ironing board that can fold right into the walls when they’re not in use.Your laundry room doesn’t have to be the most underutilized, underappreciated room in your home.

According to the American Resort Development Association (ARDA), the short answer is yes. Approximately 7.1% of U.S. households, or 9.6 million families, own one or more types of vacation ownership products.If current trends continue, young families could soon lead the way in the world of vacation ownership. In fact, despite stereotypical images of timeshare owners as empty nesters headed to the same destination to stay in the same unit every year, owners are trending younger. The average age is 44, thanks in large part to the evolving flexibility of timeshares and growing lists of destinations to visit.For Kassi and Keith Parker, who bought a timeshare in their late 20s, the decision was a no-brainer.“When we first sat down with the sales rep, we felt a bit guilty for wasting his time,” explained Kassi, who, along with her husband, invested in vacation ownership with Hilton Grand Vacations. “But not long into our conversation, it dawned on us that we could spend less on travel and continue to explore the world with all of HGV’s properties and experiences. And still being south of 30, we saw so many amazing trips in our future at such a better price.”Hilton Grand Vacations is one of a handful of timeshare companies affiliated with well-known, reputable hotel brands.“We’re Hilton Honors members and when I travel for work, I always want to stay with Hilton, because I appreciate the consistency of the brand. Nevertheless, we went into the sales presentation as complete skeptics,” explained Kassi. “Having the Hilton name behind the company gave me real peace of mind. I might not have taken the leap otherwise. We know exactly what we get with their hotels and knew it would be the same with the vacation properties.”Kassi isn’t alone. According to the State of Shared Vacation Ownership Industry study from ARDA, a timeshare company’s credibility is just one consideration consumers have when deciding to buy a timeshare.Other reasons listed include:“We found that we traveled too much to not invest in vacation ownership. We know we’re going to travel for the rest of our lives, and the fact that we can travel on a budget is one of the top reasons why we love vacation ownership,” explained Kassi. “It makes us actively think about travel and ensures we take time off to travel. Even if our year is crazy busy, we’re still going to take advantage of our vacation — even if we need to do a staycation at our home resort in Orlando. We know that we will be owners for life and the flexibility of Hilton Grand Vacations was a big decider for us.”According to the ARDA study, timeshare owners travel better and more often:“We know we are younger than the traditional timeshare owner, but this doesn’t feel like a traditional timeshare — or at least the stereotype of what people think timeshare is,” said Kassi. “When we think about the value we get back from our investment, we think about it in terms of the time we spend together, the memories we make, and the investment we make to each other and our relationship. It’s our vacation plan.”"

Preparations don’t need to be lengthy or difficult if you follow a few simple tips. Consider the following suggestions for a warm, wonderful gathering that will leave your guests feeling loved and appreciated.With whom would you most enjoy spending time at your virtual event? Are there people you’ve been wanting to get to know better? Friends you wish to thank? Family members you haven't seen in a long time? Decide who you’ll invite, then issue your invitations with ample time to reserve the date!Try sticking to your favorite recipes, perhaps incorporating dishes you think of as your “specialties” and leave out any dishes that could become overly complex or stressful. List the ingredients you’ll need and pick them up a day or two ahead, so you’ll have plenty of time for the prep work. On the same trip, pick up flowers, candles, wood for your fireplace, holiday décor or anything else that will help you create a seasonal, welcoming ambiance.Even though it’s a virtual party, you’ll want to get out your best plates, glasses and silverware and make sure everything is clean and polished from set up to clean up. Of course, that will be nearly effortless if you’ve already installed the LG QuadWash dishwasher with TrueSteam. The dishwasher uses the gentle power of TrueSteam to clean and dry dishes, delivering 60 percent fewer water spots for brilliant, sparkling glassware. That means you won't have to waste valuable time re-washing plates or wiping spotty glasses by hand.Sometimes things on Zoom can start to get awkward with people talking over one another, so get a game ready for your virtual event.

Try planning your event around a scheduled activity like the televised viewing of a movie, sports event, concert or theater performance.Once preparations are in place, all that’s left to do is to sit back and enjoy the company and great food to make lasting memories.

            "body": "While spending more time at home, you’ve probably started noticing repairs you need to make. You may have even tackled a few home improvement projects. However, there are some improvements you might not consider, because they're hidden until they reach their breaking point — like your home's plumbing system.You rely on the pipes to bring safe water into your home for cleaning, laundry and drinking every day. But you can’t usually tell something is wrong until they leak, creating water damage costing thousands of dollars.There are signs that indicate it's time to repipe your home. And when you do it right, that one project can save thousands of dollars and lots of future headaches by preventing leaks, water damage and unsafe drinking water.Here's what to look for.1. Is your home over 50 years old?If the original pipes weren't replaced, repiping might be a good idea — before large-scale water damage occurs. Older homes typically used galvanized pipes prone to corrosion, leaking and bursting.If your house was built even earlier — around the 1920s — the pipes were probably made of polybutylene and/or lead. These materials are dangerous and should be replaced immediately. Polybutylene is highly prone to breaking and leaking, so it's only a matter of time before a serious problem occurs. And lead seeps into drinking water, which can cause serious health problems for your family.2. Do you have low water pressure?When pipes contain rust or mineral buildup, it eventually restricts water flow into the house. By the time it affects your water pressure, it's the result of years of buildup — a clear sign repiping is needed.3. Have you had leaks?Bigger problems start small. If you’ve welded or patched leaks in small sections of pipe, this can indicate your entire system is at risk.4. Do you see a problem?Stains, flaking, indentations or rust on the pipes signals corrosion. Corroding pipes may leak and should be replaced. Rusty pipes can also turn water reddish or brown, indicating the need to repipe to make your water healthy to drink.5. Does your water taste or smell bad?An unappealing smell or taste may also mean your water is unsafe, because of a breakdown of your pipes. It’s best to have them inspected immediately — and drink bottled water in the meantime.6. Is it making odd noises?If your plumbing rattles, clanks or bangs, this is a sign of a larger problem. You should have your pipes checked right away.7. Does it run hot and cold?If your shower quickly switches from icy cold to burning hot, corroded materials may have broken off inside the pipes and jammed the anti-scald device or valve regulating your water temperature.The inspectionIf any of these signs sound familiar, contact a professional. Each house is different, requiring a unique repiping solution. Professionals like Uponor Pro Squad experts are trained on multiple installation configurations and considerations that can arise in your home.These experts do a thorough site analysis first, checking your home for signs of leaks, such as moisture, mildew, foundation cracks and a running water meter. They also conduct a water-usage review. Their inspection and recommendations allow you to be proactive and prevent problems before they occur.The solutionOnce the problem is identified, it’s vital to replace pipes with a more durable material. One innovative solution to repiping homes is using Uponor AquaPEX, a flexible polymer piping material that resists corrosion, pitting and scale buildup while also offering greater resiliency in freezing conditions. Flexible crosslinked polyethylene (PEX) pipe lasts longer and also makes repiping less invasive. The pipe can bend around corners and fit into tight spaces without having to cut large holes in drywall.Its benefits include:Repiping using PEX can give you peace of mind by protecting your home and family from future water disasters, costly repairs and unsafe drinking water.For more information, visit ConnectWithUponorProSquad.com."

In fact, 88% of American adults have a least-favorite cleaning task, according to a new survey from the makers of the home cleaning brand CLR® (pronounced 'CLeaR'). When asked to liken their least-favorite cleaning task to a person, 33% of Americans said it's like a scam caller. When asked to choose between activities, almost half (43%) would rather go to the dentist than handle their least-favorite cleaning task.Cleaning during quarantineConsidering the COVID-19 pandemic and the extra time people are spending at home, messes are more frequent and can quickly become bothersome. The frequency of cleaning has increased for most Americans over the past several months, but Americans are, understandably, split on their level of cleaning productivity during this time: 53% have tackled a cleaning task they've been avoiding for years during the pandemic and 42% have avoided at least one cleaning task during the pandemic.Tips for conquering a mess nemesisWhether it's soap scum, mildew, rust, stinks, stains or spills, it's time to show your mess nemesis you mean business. Follow these tips to get the job done right:Set a date: It's easy to keep avoiding tasks you loathe, so set a time for when you plan to focus on cleaning and be specific. For example, 10 a.m. Saturday you're finally giving the boot to that lime and calcium buildup on the shower door. Put on some cleaning clothes, play some motivational music and focus on getting the job done once and for all.Stock ample supplies: Stock necessities such as sponges, scrubbers and rags before diving into any cleaning mission. Having the right supplies for the specific job makes tasks simpler. Use proper cleaning formulations for your task, such as the CLR line that has products designed to get rid of the grime in virtually every area of the home, from the kitchen and bathroom to the patio, garage and beyond.Follow directions and use safer products: Always follow the directions on any product to ensure you get the results you want without making the mess worse or damaging the items. What's more, use products that clean effectively without unnecessary use of harsh chemicals. Many of the CLR products are approved by the EPA Safer Choice Program, meaning they’re recognized as a safer alternative to traditional cleaning options that rely on the use of harsh chemicals to be effective, such as bleach. Look for the EPA Safer Choice label on the front of the product.Rally the troops: Whether it's a big mess that requires multiple sets of hands or a tough mess that requires a few people strategizing, help can make a big difference. Even if you need to focus on the mess nemesis while other people handle regular household chores, this can keep things moving forward thanks to teamwork. Get your partner, spouse, kids or roommates in on the action."

            "summary": "",
            "body": "This holiday, people around the world are getting ready for a season that looks dramatically different from past years. As millions decide to stay home, the desire to make the most out of the holiday festivities is driving people to find more creative, convenient, and memorable ways to enjoy the season and eliminate unnecessary stress.Whether you’re relaxing at home or celebrating with family, a smart home can help take care of daily tasks around the house, giving you more time to enjoy the things that matter most. Not only can smart home products enhance the holiday ambiance, but they can also simplify daily tasks and help you keep your home and family safe. These affordable devices provide the perfect blend of good cheer and peace of mind that are exactly the combination in high demand this year.Here are five ways smart home devices can take the stress out of the season and help you enjoy a safe, relaxing holiday.1. Automate holiday lights with smart plugsUsing an automatic timer for holiday lights is nothing new, but smart plugs take convenience to the next level. They’re easy to setup and, unlike fussy old-school timers, give you greater control. With smart plugs, you can simply use your smartphone to turn on holiday lights right from the couch, without kneeling behind a tree to plug in a power cord or stepping out in the cold to turn on lights or inflatable decorations in your yard.2. Upgrade to a Smart Christmas treeIf finding, transporting, and composting a live tree is too much hassle this year, consider upgrading to an artificial tree with smart lights built in. A smart Christmas tree comes with lights pre-installed and, using your smartphone or Amazon Alexa, you can easily select the lighting color, turn lights on or off, or schedule the lights to turn on at a certain time each night. Many smart Christmas trees even let you change lighting modes with a simple voice command like “set Christmas tree to blue,” or “set Christmas tree to sparkle” to create a flawless festive mood.3. Keep track of comings and goings with smart security camerasFor the holidays and beyond, one of the best investments you can make is a smart home security camera. As online shopping for everything from holiday presents to daily household essentials continues to increase, having a smart home security camera can alert you when your purchases arrive and help keep them safe.Popular smart home security cameras like Blink Outdoor are wireless, weather-resistant, and offer up to two years of battery life, making them easy and convenient to install anywhere around your home. For indoor settings, Blink Indoor security cameras can help you check in on your home day or night with motion alerts and infrared night vision.The full range of features are detailed at www.amazon.com/blink, but their cameras also provide two-way audio and live video, so you can check in on your family, accept deliveries, and greet visitors remotely. Not only does this help encourage social distancing, it also means you stay cozy with fewer trips to the front door.4. Protect against winter hazards with smart alarmsUpgrading to smart alarms is another top strategy for staying safe during the winter. You might not associate fires with winter, but house fires are actually more prevalent with the increased use of fireplaces and heaters. Smart smoke alarms alert you to problems even when you’re not at home, ensuring you get help as soon as possible.Winter also means keeping your home sealed up tight. While this saves energy and keeps you warm, it also increases the risk of carbon monoxide build-up. Smart CO detectors give you up-to-the-moment information about the air quality in your home, allowing you to breathe easy.5. Sink into a holiday soundscape with smart speakersFinally, smart speakers are the best choice for immersing yourself in the sounds of the holidays. People are missing the cheerful carols and soaring classical music that normally fills the air when you’re out and about this time of year. Capture that feeling with smart speakers. Use them to sync your music throughout your home, and transform it into a winter wonderland in no time.While this winter will certainly be different, smart home devices can help encourage holiday cheer while keeping everyone safe and sound. From security cameras to dazzling lights, there’s a smart solution out there that can make your holidays even brighter."

You may need to heat or cool your home so it’s livable, someone in your family may rely on home medical equipment, and you want your refrigerated food to be safe to eat.Power outages have been increasing due to extreme weather events, plus more people staying home — sometimes causing an overload in energy demands. Being able to cope with unexpected power outages is crucial to your family’s comfort, well-being and safety.How to be ready for power outagesYou may think you’re ready for an outage because you’ve got plenty of flashlights and batteries. Maybe you even have a portable charger for your phone and electronic gadgets. But think about all the items powered by electricity in your home. Even if you have a gas stove, you need electricity to safely ignite it. You rely on your modem to provide internet and even phone connectivity. And the longer the outage lasts, the more you've got to worry about.What your family really needs is safe, reliable backup power.Choosing a generator for your homeWhen extreme weather events hit, you don’t want to be one of the many people running to the home improvement store to try to snag the last generator on the shelf. The truth is, you actually have two choices when it comes to generators — a portable model or an automatic standby generator. Either one can help you during an outage, so it’s a good idea to know the difference between the two.Portable generatorsHaving a portable generator handy gives you an easy-to-use, low-cost option which offers you some peace of mind in case of a temporary outage. One benefit to portable generators is that they can be used for a variety of outdoor activities like camping and tailgating.Portable generators supply enough power for a handful of individual products or systems in your home, like your refrigerator or lights. They are manually operated, which means you need to be home to get them started and keep them fueled throughout the power outage.In addition, to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning, you need to be sure your portable generator is placed at least 20 feet away from your home outdoors, and not inside a garage or screened-in porch. Having a carbon monoxide detector in your home is a highly recommended safeguard.When using a portable generator, make sure all the systems and appliances you’re backing up from your home are plugged in with properly rated extension cords that run from your home outdoors to the portable generator.Companies like Kohler offer portable generators in a variety of sizes to meet your power demands. Most portable units run on gasoline, so be sure to keep extra fuel on hand. Automatic standby generatorsFor a more permanent solution, you could choose to have an automatic standby generator permanently installed outside your home, similar to a central air conditioning unit. These generators can power everything in your home, and they run on propane or natural gas supplied from your home, with no refueling necessary.One big advantage of an automatic standby generator is that you do not need to be present to start up and operate the system. When the power goes out, an automatic transfer switch shifts power from the main utility to your generator within seconds — whether you’re home or away.A Kohler Home Generator delivers high-quality power to your home that won’t harm your sophisticated electronics. Larger units can supply enough power to keep your critical hard-wired systems running, including your HVAC, sump pumps, security systems and large appliances. These generators run quietly and come in a corrosion-resistant housing which prevents rusting. You can also use your smartphone or tablet for remote monitoring of the system.Want to learn more about protecting your home from the next power outage? Visit KohlerPower.com."

However, love is leading the way as couples are making thoughtful adjustments to their ceremonies to reflect their personalities and commitment to each other while prioritizing health and safety.'Expect the unexpected is a phrase wedding planners have shared with couples for decades, and the global pandemic is certainly having an impact on matrimony traditions,' says Jonalee DeNoble, associate director of meetings and events at Destination Kohler. 'Although the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way weddings are typically planned and performed, that doesn't mean you can't still have a dream wedding in a memorable location.'Jonalee offers expert insights for planning a wedding during the pandemic and the top wedding trends that smart brides and grooms are embracing:Smaller groups provide intimacy enjoyed by allHaving hundreds of people gather for a wedding or reception simply isn't possible right now. Don't sweat the change and instead embrace the intimacy that only smaller celebrations can provide. This might be a few dozen of your closest friends and family or something as simple as the bride and groom and their parents. There is a beauty in smaller ceremonies that truly reflects the unconditional love a couple has for each other. When planning, remember group gathering restrictions vary by state and can change at any time, so be sure to plan accordingly and be conservative in your numbers.Road trips rule for local destination weddingsJetting to a tropical country or international destination for a wedding is not currently a great option, however, you can still enjoy a dream destination wedding in a picturesque setting when you explore options within driving distance. For example, Kohler, Wisconsin, is the premier wedding destination for people in the Midwest, with the new Straits Chapel at Destination Kohler that's an intimate location surrounded by the beauty and serenity of nature. The picturesque setting of Straits Chapel, complemented by its modern design and proximity to Whistling Straits golf course, will captivate guests looking to celebrate as well as seeking a place for tranquility.Nature-based settings are stunning and spaciousOpting for celebrations in nature over urban settings helps guests feel more comfortable knowing there is ample space for safety and social distancing. For example, Straits Chapel is nestled in the woods on the edge of bluffs overlooking Lake Michigan, which provides stunning views with plenty of access to the outdoors. When planning a wedding, consider if you want an indoor or outdoor ceremony, and how the natural benefits of parks, gardens and other nature-based destinations can enhance your wedding aesthetically while also providing a safer setting for everyone who attends your special day.Streaming ceremonies and celebrations onlineSo many people are working and attending school online, it's no surprise that the wedding ceremony has gone digital, too. Knowing celebrations will likely be smaller, this is a wonderful way to make people feel included even if they can't attend in person. Research platforms and streaming options, as many have pros and cons, and choose the best one for your needs. Then on the big day you can broadcast the ceremony and celebration to loved ones who want to watch as you say 'I do' and share your first moments as a married couple.Request contactless accommodationsFor guests who are attending the ceremony in person and need a place to stay overnight, research the safest and most convenient options so they can choose which they are most comfortable with. Many hotels have upgraded cleaning routines and offer contactless accommodations for a safer experience. Guests at Destination Kohler might consider the new Lake and Pond cabins with upscale features in a beautiful location that is very secluded from other guests. Reach out and get the details on different options to make it easy for guests to feel comfortable with their stay.'COVID-19 has forced us to go back to the drawing board and create unique and luxury experiences while keeping everyone safe,” says DeNoble. 'With great thought and our proactive measures, you can have a dream wedding with memories to last a lifetime.'"

            "body": "The hotel industry has always been on the forefront of finding innovative ways to accommodate and take care of guests. Even though the COVID-19 pandemic has led to canceled or rescheduled plans, many hotels are focused on developing long-term strategies to give their guests the safest and best possible experience. If you’re looking to travel right now, consider booking with a hotel implementing one or all of these six strategies.1. Employing digital assistantsImagine being able to interact closely with a hotel worker who delivers towels and snacks straight to your room, controls elevators and accommodates your needs while keeping safety at the forefront. Hotel attendants like this might sound like a thing of the past, but at The Mercantile Hotel in New Orleans, it’s a reality. The hotel takes contactless service to the next level with their robot Suga, a three-foot tall, automated butler designed to accommodate guest needs in record-breaking time. Suga goes above and beyond to ensure all guests and employees can practice social distancing while still enjoying the comforts and amenities of hands-on hotel services.Digital concierges also make hotel stays more convenient. The Mercantile Hotel is also home to Angie, an interactive digital concierge stationed in each guest room. Available 24 hours a day, this interactive virtual assistant has voice control and touch-screen capabilities. You can customize your stay, check in, play music, make hands-free calls, access hotel amenities, charge mobile devices and more with Angie.2. Offering micro-wedding servicesWith wedding postponements a common practice due to group gathering limitations, many hotels like The Hilton at Pensacola Beach have begun offering “micro-wedding” or “minimony” packages. These are exactly what they sound like: smaller, more intimate ceremonies that give couples the ability to celebrate their special day amidst the backdrop of the pandemic. Many micro-wedding and upgraded elopement providers still offer most of what you’d expect at a full-fledged ceremony — bouquets and flower packages, staff like an officiant and a photographer, and more — at a fraction of the price.Some couples who picked their special date a year or more in advance have opted for a small ceremony in honor of their chosen wedding day, leaving the option for a larger, future celebration open for when we can all happily gather together again.3. Renovating for the futureSome hotels took advantage of a slower travel season to make headway on exciting new renovations designed with the pandemic era in mind. For example, Beachside Hotel &amp; Suites in Cocoa Beach, Florida, returned to its ‘60s glory in May 2020 after a $5.9 million renovation. The hotel offers a relaxed, retro vibe and showcases unique features including individually ventilated rooms and pet-friendly amenities. Beachside also ramped up its outdoor services to accommodate current guest preferences, including a luxury lazy river pool, an outdoor mural for social media photo-ops and rocket-launch viewing locations.4. Giving back to the communityDoctors, nurses, EMTs, paramedics and other healthcare heroes have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic, serving selflessly on the frontlines. In the spirit of hospitality, Innisfree Hotels opened up their rooms to essential workers who need to isolate from their families for safety, allowing them to fully rest and recharge. Additionally, the hotels were staffed with team members who received supplemental training on critical health and safety measures to ensure the safety of all guests.5. Pivoting to take-outAmidst the backdrop of this year’s public health crisis, H20 at the Hilton Pensacola Beach not only switched to curbside pickup, but they also fully redesigned their pantry into a butcher shop. The hotel’s butcher shop offered high-quality proteins to locals and visitors alike for low prices. Menu items included New York steak, filet mignon, rib-eye, veal chops, salmon, snapper, sushi and more. Guests who shared photos of their homecooked meals with H20 via Instagram were entered for a chance to win a free dinner for two at the award-winning restaurant once normal operations resumed.6. Creating an essentials drive-thruEarly on in the pandemic, SpringHill Suites in Panama City Beach, Florida, created an “essentials” drive-thru as a safe way to get much-needed quarantine supplies, like food, personal care items and cleaning supplies, into the community. Here, customers could drive up to the hotel’s parking garage to purchase affordable essentials for their families.While the pandemic continues to affect the travel industry, many hotels’ resilient and creative strategies are helping them provide safe options for guests passing through."

            "body": "The kitchen is one of the most important rooms in the house — especially now, when we’re all at home more than ever. And while we’re cooking more meals in and stocking up on necessities, having the right features and appliances can help make our lives in the kitchen easier when we all need it most.Whether you’re looking to improve capacity for storing essentials, or you simply want the most useful kitchen innovations, these are the top refrigeration trends to keep an eye on as we head into the holiday season and beyond:1. Fast, freshly filtered iceHave you been reaching for more ice water while at home? You’re not alone. A recent survey revealed that 50% of Americans consider themselves “ice obsessed,” with 53% realizing the need for better ice production at home during the COVID-19 pandemic and the same percentage saying no ice available means they simply drink less water. The survey also found that the average American consumes up to 116 glasses of ice per month or nearly 36 pounds!Always looking for ways to simplify life for consumers, the new QuickIcePro System refrigerator from Bosch is one of the fastest refrigerator ice makers in the industry, producing several pounds of freshly filtered ice a day at a rapid rate — which means you won’t be running out anytime soon.2. Fresh-food storageIf you’re staying home, cooking more and making fewer trips to the store, you need extra storage and features that will keep your food fresher longer. Refrigerators have come a long way in helping you maintain optimal freshness, especially when it comes to fresh produce. Look for options that offer precise temperature and humidity control, like the Bosch FarmFresh System, to take your food preservation to the next level and minimize waste. This advanced system uses four technologies to circulate cool air, filter out unwanted odors and ethylene gas, as well as remove the guesswork in storing items at the ideal environment.3. Energy-efficient technologyTechnology can also help you save energy and money at the same time. For example, refrigerators with automatic freezing functions return to normal operation after reaching the required freezing temperature to save energy. As a result, frozen food keeps its flavor, even when new food is being added.And if you’ve ever accidently left your fridge or freezer open, you know it can be a costly mistake. Some refrigerators can help you avoid those high energy bills and spoiled food by sending a notification directly to your smartphone if a door has been left open.4. Smart refrigeratorsIf you’ve ever been at the grocery store without a list, it’s likely you wished for a crystal ball to see inside your fridge. Connected appliances help make that wish come true with remote monitoring and diagnostics, fridge and pantry management, and quick-cooling capabilities that get your fridge ready for new items when you’re on your way back from the grocery store.5. Two-in-one appliancesRefrigeration isn’t only about keeping your food fresh. Storing beverages at the right temperature is just as important. In fact, 56% of Americans agree that having a drink at the wrong temperature has the potential to make their day less enjoyable.The new Bosch Refreshment Center refrigerator offers pre-programmed settings to take the guesswork out of achieving the optimal temperature for the beverages of your choice at the touch of a button — from red or white wine to beer, soda or other drinks. Plus, its industry-first, glass-front beverage drawer puts beverages in view and within reach in your kitchen, eliminating the need for a second appliance dedicated to drink storage elsewhere in your home.6. Easy organizationHaving a large fridge and freezer makes it easier to store more, but without organization, food can become lost or buried and go to waste. To make it easier, the new Bosch French door bottom mount refrigeration collection features organizational solutions like a FlexBar, split glass shelving and three-tiered freezer system to make it easier to keep all your ingredients organized, in view and within reach.Now more than ever, the kitchen has become a place that brings everyone together. Turn yours into the focal point of your home with these refrigeration trends for a happier and more efficient space."

            "html": "<p>The kitchen is one of the most important rooms in the house — especially now, when we’re all at home more than ever. And while we’re cooking more meals in and stocking up on necessities, having the right features and appliances can help make our lives in the kitchen easier when we all need it most.</p><p>Whether you’re looking to improve capacity for storing essentials, or you simply want the most useful kitchen innovations, these are the top refrigeration trends to keep an eye on as we head into the holiday season and beyond:</p><p><strong>1. Fast, freshly filtered ice</strong></p><p>Have you been reaching for more ice water while at home? You’re not alone. A recent <a href=\"https://www.bosch-home.com/us/press/pressrelease-5056#main-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">survey</a> revealed that 50% of Americans consider themselves “ice obsessed,” with 53% realizing the need for better ice production at home during the COVID-19 pandemic and the same percentage saying no ice available means they simply drink less water. The survey also found that the average American consumes up to 116 glasses of ice per month or nearly 36 pounds!</p><p>Always looking for ways to simplify life for consumers, the new <a href=\"https://www.bosch-home.com/us/specials/quickicepro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">QuickIcePro System</a> refrigerator from Bosch is one of the fastest refrigerator ice makers in the industry, producing several pounds of freshly filtered ice a day at a rapid rate — which means you won’t be running out anytime soon.</p><p><strong>2. Fresh-food storage</strong></p><p>If you’re staying home, cooking more and making fewer trips to the store, you need extra storage and features that will keep your food fresher longer. Refrigerators have come a long way in helping you maintain optimal freshness, especially when it comes to fresh produce. Look for options that offer precise temperature and humidity control, like the Bosch <a href=\"https://www.bosch-home.com/us/FreshbyDesign\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FarmFresh System</a>, to take your food preservation to the next level and minimize waste. This advanced system uses four technologies to circulate cool air, filter out unwanted odors and ethylene gas, as well as remove the guesswork in storing items at the ideal environment.</p><p><strong>3. Energy-efficient technology</strong></p><p>Technology can also help you save energy and money at the same time. For example, refrigerators with automatic freezing functions return to normal operation after reaching the required freezing temperature to save energy. As a result, frozen food keeps its flavor, even when new food is being added.</p><p>And if you’ve ever accidently left your fridge or freezer open, you know it can be a costly mistake. Some refrigerators can help you avoid those high energy bills and spoiled food by sending a notification directly to your smartphone if a door has been left open.</p><p><strong>4. Smart refrigerators</strong></p><p>If you’ve ever been at the grocery store without a list, it’s likely you wished for a crystal ball to see inside your fridge. Connected appliances help make that wish come true with remote monitoring and diagnostics, fridge and pantry management, and quick-cooling capabilities that get your fridge ready for new items when you’re on your way back from the grocery store.</p><p><strong>5. Two-in-one appliances</strong></p><p>Refrigeration isn’t only about keeping your food fresh. Storing beverages at the right temperature is just as important. In fact, 56% of Americans agree that having a drink at the wrong temperature has the potential to make their day less enjoyable.</p><p>The new Bosch <a href=\"https://www.bosch-home.com/us/RefreshmentCenter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Refreshment Center</a> refrigerator offers pre-programmed settings to take the guesswork out of achieving the optimal temperature for the beverages of your choice at the touch of a button — from red or white wine to beer, soda or other drinks. Plus, its industry-first, glass-front beverage drawer puts beverages in view and within reach in your kitchen, eliminating the need for a second appliance dedicated to drink storage elsewhere in your home.</p><p><strong>6. Easy organization</strong></p><p>Having a large fridge and freezer makes it easier to store more, but without organization, food can become lost or buried and go to waste. To make it easier, the new Bosch French door bottom mount refrigeration collection features organizational solutions like a FlexBar, split glass shelving and three-tiered freezer system to make it easier to keep all your ingredients organized, in view and within reach.</p><p>Now more than ever, the kitchen has become a place that brings everyone together. Turn yours into the focal point of your home with these refrigeration trends for a happier and more efficient space.</p>",

            "body": "The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the consumption of single-use plastic as disposable mask and glove usage has skyrocketed. Additionally, many businesses have eliminated the option to use reusable shopping bags at a store or to bring your own mug to a coffee shop.These measures are important to help stop the spread of the virus but there are simple steps to take to help reduce your single-use plastic consumption and achieve a more sustainable way of living, even during the coronavirus pandemic. Here are six ideas:1) Buy localIf possible, get out to your local farmers market or butcher for your grocery shopping. Farmers market vendors often use less packaging and you can ask your butcher to wrap your meat in wax paper instead of plastic. Shopping local is also a great way to support your community.2) Swap your cleaning toolsThe leading spray mop uses single-use plastic pads. One greener choice, the O-Cedar ProMist MAX Microfiber Spray Mop features a reusable, machine washable microfiber pad and a refillable bottle to cut down on plastic waste while removing over 99%of E. coli and Staph. aureus from pre-finished hardwood flooring and ceramic tile using tap water, as tested at an independent accredited lab.3) Plate over bowl, bowl over plateIf you’re doing more cooking at home, you’re likely finding yourself with leftovers. Ditch the plastic wrap and use your dishes as an easy, inexpensive food storage solution. To do this, place a plate or saucer over a bowl to cover its contents or, alternatively, flip any size bowl over leftovers on a plate. It’s a simple solution using what you already have. You’ll be protecting your food from drying out in the fridge while eliminating your plastic waste.4) DIY cleaning solutionsWith all the extra cleaning you’re doing around the house, buying cleaning solutions in disposable bottles for your home can be expensive and result in additional plastic waste. The average household goes through 18 bottles a year of cleaning solution when using the leading disposable spray mop. (Calculated using consumer consumption data found in Linkage Research Report: Spray Mop Habits &amp; Practices Study (March 10, 2020).) Instead use a refillable bottle and make your own cleaning solution using water and your choice of vinegar or castile soap.5) Wear a cloth maskSafety guidelines make it difficult to go anywhere without wearing a face covering. But the popularity of disposable face masks has impacted the amount of plastic in the waste stream, according to a report by the LA Times. Do your part by opting to wear reusable, cloth masks – you can find them just about anywhere these days.6) Avoid plastic where you canWhen you’re ordering takeout, be sure to ask the restaurant to leave out any extra disposable materials. For example, let them know you don’t need disposable silverware. And although most coffee shops and cafes aren’t accepting reusable drink containers, you can still bring your own reusable straw."

This enthusiasm is shared by more than just serious gamers; with so many people spending more time at home due to quarantine and social distancing, they've discovered gaming as a pastime they can enjoy alone or with their family. So how can you prepare to get the ultimate experience in your household?Experience epic visuals with the ultimate TVIt doesn't matter how advanced your console is if you don't have a TV that can keep up with it. With stellar picture quality and industry leading gaming features such as HDMI 2.1, LG's 2020 OLED TVs are not only ideal for serious gamers, allowing for more gaming action in real time, but also great for sports fans and film buffs.“For next-gen consoles, you absolutely need an LG OLED TV,” says professional gamer Arteezy of esports team Evil Geniuses. “The high refresh rates and very fast response times make the gameplay much smoother and enjoyable.”Celebrated as the most advanced gaming TV on the market, LG’s 2020 OLED TV lineup raises the bar, providing an immersive and smooth gaming experience. The LG OLED TV reduces screen tearing (when a screen shows visuals from multiple frames) or other distracting visual artifacts like lag and stuttering.The LG OLED TV will make you feel like you’re right there in the game, with perfect blacks and intense colors that let you see all the details without slowing down gameplay. How? Millions of pixels emit their own light independently and can be completely turned off. This unveils perfect black, over a billion rich colors and infinite contrast.Utilize gaming modes and picture settingsThe most advanced TVs have special modes and picture settings that are created with gaming in mind, so you get incredible colors and visuals. For example, some TVs like LG OLED have Dolby Vision® and the HDR Gaming Interest Group's HGiG Mode, created so gamers can enjoy high-quality visuals as game creators and developers intended when playing High Dynamic Range (HDR) games via consoles. HGiG is a group made up of companies from the game and display industries that develops standards to improve the HDR gaming experience for people in their homes.In addition to gaming modes, make sure you check your TV’s picture settings to determine which you prefer for your gaming. Some gamers even change picture settings from game to game. Sound settings can be updated and customized as well, and you may want to add a soundbar to your setup for the best audio experience.Research gaming controllersWhether you’re an amateur or a seasoned gamer, it’s worth investing in a controller you love. These new systems come with controllers, but many gamers prefer to upgrade to options that best fit their gaming style. You’ll need to decide between cord and wireless: Some people prefer the cord, so they never have to worry about batteries running out while others swear by wireless for freedom of movement.When researching controllers keep muscle memory in mind. Past gaming experiences reflect on your skills in the future, so think about buttons, toggles and shape of the controller so you can find one that reflects characteristics you enjoyed in the past and improves on ones you didn’t. One top recommendation to check out: The Razer Wolverine V2.Set up seating strategicallyEven the most satisfying gaming session can ultimately be disappointing if you end up with a sore neck or back. A comfortable chair can elevate any gaming session, especially those that are adjustable for customized, ergonomic support.If new furniture isn't an option, check out your current seating and look for opportunities for improvement. Adding cushions and pillows can amplify comfort tremendously, so stock up on back pillows and lumbar supports so every gamer — young, old and in-between — feels as good after a gaming session as they did at the start.Bottom line: Next-gen consoles are truly remarkable systems. You can enjoy the best they offer with the right complementary technologies and gear. Great equipment brings the next-gen console gaming experience to new heights."

One of the main reasons is that buying and selling through resale marketplaces makes it easier for people to find deals or make money to supplement their income.In 2020, buying and selling locally became more popular as people bought things to create home offices, outfit home gyms, and keep their families entertained. Some enterprising sellers decluttered and supplemented their incomes by using online marketplaces to sell their unwanted or unused items.Though more people bought holiday gifts online this season, despite shoppers’ best efforts, not all gifts will hit the mark this year. The popular online shopping app OfferUp conducted a survey of its buyers and sellers and found that 39% of people surveyed said they are most likely to sell a gift they receive if they are not interested in it. And many plan to use that money towards monthly expenses like rent (40%) and daily essentials (30%) like groceries.Meanwhile, 31% surveyed saying they are more likely to regift an item this year than last year. Compared to 2019, women are more likely to regift than men (37% vs. 26%).OfferUp found some interesting results on buying trends this year as well:Resale can help you save money. The opportunity to save money is a primary motivator for respondents. Sixty-five percent will shop such marketplaces to save money and/or buy what they want without paying full retail prices — and 39% expect to save up to $300 for their efforts.Reduce, reuse, recycle, repeat.

A substantial 46% of respondents say finding something reused and environmentally sustainable is more important than finding something new and trendy.You can find rare or heavily discounted items. The search for rare or discontinued items is another big draw for online resale shoppers; 43% of respondents search such venues for goods or gifts they may not be able to find elsewhere.Resale supports local businesses. Thirty-four percent of respondents are more likely to purchase from a resale marketplace than a physical store because they prefer to support local vendors.Those looking to make money by selling things they don’t need can try resale now by downloading a popular app like OfferUp.

            "body": "Despite the economic challenges since the beginning of the global COVID-19 pandemic this year, one area of the U.S. economy is still going strong: agriculture. Amid so much uncertainty, food security is essential to the population of the United States and the world.Currently, American farms not only grow enough food for America's 330 million residents, but they also export more than 20% of what they produce to international markets, according to American Farm Bureau Federation economist Veronica Nigh.The pandemic had some impact on exports, although the effect appears to be temporary. “International buyers’ ability to purchase U.S. ag products isn’t what it was before the COVID-19 outbreak, but it appears this situation is just a temporary shock,” says Nigh. “America is in a strong position when things normalize after COVID-19.”The importance of agricultural exports to the U.S. economyAll of the agriculture exports America produces help to drive the farm economy of the United States and the country’s economy as a whole. Top exports include soybeans, corn, wheat and cotton.According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the dollar value of agricultural exports in 2018 was nearly $140 billion, combined with nearly $163 billion in additional economic expenditure stimulated by agricultural exports — adding to a combined total of almost $303 billion.AgExportsCount.com reports that approximately one million jobs are supported by U.S. agricultural exports, including 764,000 jobs in the nonfarm sector. Those non-farm jobs are connected to areas such as supplying seed and crop protection products, transporting commodities, plus processing and distributing agricultural products for export.Population growth and agriculture demandDemand for U.S. agricultural products can grow with more trade partnerships. According to the United Nations, the current world population is 7.8 billion, and more than 95% of those people live outside of the United States.“The global population is projected to soar to nearly 10 billion people by 2050,” says Sara Wyant, veteran farm policy reporter and president of Agri-Pulse Communications, Inc. “We need to keep looking at areas around the globe where demand growth is likely for U.S. ag products.”Growing populations in many parts of the world, like India and African countries, will likely need more U.S. agricultural exports.“The key is to avoid focus on just a few trading partners,” said David Widmar, agricultural economist with Agricultural Economic Insights. “We need to maintain and grow trade with a host of countries.”How U.S. farmers can thriveTo succeed and expand agricultural exports moving into the future, American farms need to continue to produce the most marketable crops possible, using elite seed genetics and proven crop protection products.“Twenty years ago, hardly any farmers were using fungicides in corn,” said Lynn Sandlin, business intelligence manager at Syngenta. “Now, growers have Syngenta products like Trivapro and Miravis brand fungicides for broad-spectrum disease control and plant-health benefits. These help farmers grow the very best crop possible, in terms of quality and yield potential.”Optimizing a crop’s potential in these ways is crucial — not only to continuing to feed all of America's families, but to encourage and keep up with increasing global demand for U.S. agriculture exports.To learn more about the role of the agriculture industry in the economy, visit www.SyngentaThrive.com.Despite all of the unprecedented economic challenges since the beginning of the global COVID-19 pandemic this year, there’s one area of the U.S. economy that is still going strong: agriculture.

            "body": "Nearly every business has been disrupted by COVID-19 in some way, which makes this year’s holiday shopping season more important than ever for many small businesses. Small business owners have demonstrated incredible resilience and creativity this year, and there are ways they can prepare for a holiday shopping season unlike any we’ve seen before.For consumers, the season is already underway — and the way to reach them is online. More than 70% of U.S. adults said they planned to do more than half of their shopping digitally this year, and those shoppers are open to buying from small retailers, especially local small businesses.Below are a few ways businesses can be digitally ready to reach customers this holiday shopping season from Kim Spalding, Google’s global product director for small business ads.Create a strong digital presence and keep customers informedTo help you get ready for the holidays, we created a holiday hub where business owners can get personalized recommendations to reach shoppers where they are across search, shopping and maps.Sixty-six percent of people in the U.S. who plan to shop this holiday season said they will shop more at local small businesses. This is great news for business owners, especially as they can stand out by personalizing the customer experience.To ensure customers are finding the most up-to-date information about your business when they search on Google, be sure to claim and update your Business Profile. During this holiday season, you can add links to your online store so shoppers can easily place a pickup or delivery order when researching your business on Google, and also let customers know the added safety precautions you're taking throughout COVID, like offering plexiglass at checkout.In just six months, we’ve seen people changing how they shop. Global searches for “curbside pickup” have grown by over 3,000% over this time last year. Knowing that curbside pickup is likely to be of interest for many holiday customers, you could showcase this service, as well as offering virtual shopping concierge services, gift certificates, customizable gift packages, or flexible return policies. Make sure to share this information on all of your online channels, including your website, and across your social media channels.Show up when shoppers are searchingFor small businesses owners, it’s critical for your products to be in front of consumers searching online. We recently announced that retailers offering e-commerce can list their products for free on Google, making what you offer more accessible to the hundreds of millions of people who shop online every day. You can get started by either submitting your product feed through our Merchant Center or by automating this through platforms like Shopify, WooCommerce or BigCommerce. You can also get your inventory online instantly by connecting to Pointy from Google via a compatible point-of-sale system or device.If you’re ready to advertise, you can use Smart campaigns — built specifically for small businesses. If you don’t yet have a website, Smart campaigns can automatically build a landing page with your phone number, hours, photos and even your reviews. Platforms like Wix and WordPress also offer free accounts that help small business owners build affordable websites.Adapt to changing customer behaviorTo keep your finger on the pulse of customer trends in real time, our Rising Retail categories tool shows a list of the fastest growing retail-related search categories on Google at a national and state level — including the most popular queries related to each category.We know customers want to shop locally and support small businesses. And this is even more evident this holiday season, so be sure to get your business in front of the people who are looking for your products and services."

More than 70% of U.S. adults said they planned to do more than half of their shopping digitally this year, and those shoppers are open to buying from small retailers, especially local small businesses.</p><p>Below are a few ways businesses can be digitally ready to reach customers this holiday shopping season from Kim Spalding, Google’s global product director for small business ads.</p><p><strong>Create a strong digital presence and keep customers informed</strong></p><p>To help you get ready for the holidays, we created a <a href=\"https://smallbusiness.withgoogle.com/holiday/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=keyword&amp;utm_campaign=smb_holiday#!/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">holiday hub</a> where business owners can get personalized recommendations to reach shoppers where they are across search, shopping and maps.</p><p>Sixty-six percent of people in the U.S. who plan to shop this holiday season said they will shop more at local small businesses. This is great news for business owners, especially as they can stand out by personalizing the customer experience.</p><p>To ensure customers are finding the most up-to-date information about your business when they search on Google, be sure to claim and update your <a href=\"https://www.google.com/business/?&amp;gmbsrc=us-en-ha-se-z-gmb-s-z-h~bk;&amp;ppsrc=GMBS0&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI3MDW7Yj-6wIVwxd9Ch3zJgY3EAAYASAAEgIpdPD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Business Profile</a>. During this holiday season, you can add links to your online store so shoppers can easily place a pickup or delivery order when researching your business on Google, and also let customers know the added safety precautions you're taking throughout COVID, like offering plexiglass at checkout.</p><p>In just six months, we’ve seen people changing how they shop. Global searches for “curbside pickup” have grown by over 3,000% over this time last year. Knowing that curbside pickup is likely to be of interest for many holiday customers, you could showcase this service, as well as offering virtual shopping concierge services, gift certificates, customizable gift packages, or flexible return policies. Make sure to share this information on all of your online channels, including your website, and across your social media channels.</p><p><strong>Show up when shoppers are searching</strong></p><p>For small businesses owners, it’s critical for your products to be in front of consumers searching online. We recently announced that retailers offering e-commerce can list their products for free on Google, making what you offer more accessible to the hundreds of millions of people who shop online every day. You can get started by either submitting your product feed through our Merchant Center or by automating this through platforms like Shopify, WooCommerce or BigCommerce. You can also get your inventory online instantly by connecting to Pointy from Google via a compatible point-of-sale system or device.</p><p>If you’re ready to advertise, you can use <a href=\"http://ads.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Smart campaigns</a> — built specifically for small businesses. If you don’t yet have a website, Smart campaigns can automatically build a landing page with your phone number, hours, photos and even your reviews. Platforms like Wix and WordPress also offer free accounts that help small business owners build affordable websites.</p><p><strong>Adapt to changing customer behavior</strong></p><p>To keep your finger on the pulse of customer trends in real time, our <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/feature/category-trends/us/month/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rising Retail categories</a> tool shows a list of the fastest growing retail-related search categories on Google at a national and state level — including the most popular queries related to each category.</p><p>We know customers want to shop locally and support small businesses. And this is even more evident this holiday season, so be sure to get your business in front of the people who are looking for your products and services.</p>",

            "body": "While recycling is a proactive way to have a positive impact on the planet, putting recyclable items out on the curb is just one step in the overall process. Cartons, like those made by Tetra Pak, are recyclable and are common in many households since they package food and beverage staples including milk, soups, broths, juices, protein shakes and other prepared foods. There are two types of cartons: those that need to be refrigerated and those that are shelf-stable, which means they store food safely at room temperature.Cartons are made mostly of paperboard, with thin layers of plastic. Shelf-stable, or aseptic cartons also contain a thin layer of aluminum. These layers maintain the quality, flavor and nutrients of the products without the need for preservatives or refrigeration, making them ideal for pantry items. And when recycled, both refrigerated and shelf-stable cartons can be transformed into many different types of new products.Before this transformation can take place, there are important steps you can take to properly prepare cartons for their recycling journey. First, be sure to empty cartons of all remaining product, although you do not need to rinse them. Next, keep caps on the carton, and push straws (like those on a juice box) back into the package. This simple step ensures the cap and/or straw is recycled with the carton and doesn’t end up as litter. Cartons can be sorted manually or by machine, so it’s important not to flatten them so they can be easily identified by their three-dimensional shape.After cartons and other recyclable materials are picked up from the curb, they’re taken to a materials recovery facility, or MRF, to be sorted by material type. Sorted cartons can follow one of two paths as they are transformed into new materials.Path 1: From cartons to construction materialsIn the first path, cartons are sent to a building material manufacturer and shredded into pieces the size of a quarter. The pieces are pressed together in a machine that looks like a large panini sandwich press. The press applies high heat, pressing the pieces together into boards of building material that can be used for eco-friendly roofing, floors and walls. Cartons make great building materials because of their mold- and moisture-resistant properties. A single 4-by-8-foot board can give new life to about 400 cartons!Path 2: To the paper millsIn the second path, cartons are sent to a paper mill for processing. Cartons and water are put into a large machine called a hydrapulper, which separates out the layers of paperboard, plastic and aluminum. The pulp from the paperboard fiber is used to make products such as office paper, notebooks, tissues, paper towels and more. The small amount of plastic and/or aluminum left over can be used in different ways such as energy generation or manufacturing of wood-plastic laminates.By reusing the raw materials in cartons for new products, virgin materials do not have to be harvested to make those same products. This results in reduced carbon dioxide emissions and less water and energy use. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, every ton of paper made from recycled materials conserves 7,000 gallons of water, 17 to 31 trees, 4,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity and 60 pounds of air pollutants!To learn more about carton recycling in your community, visit the Carton Council’s website at www.recyclecartons.com."

            "body": "Recent projects have seen project managers and change makers find resourceful ways to maintain momentum and avoid obstacles, despite a global pandemic. To honor this perseverance, Project Management Institute (PMI), with input from hundreds of experts globally, has unveiled 2020’s 50 Most Influential Projects, off the heels of its inaugural year in 2019.In addition to the top 50, PMI released 30 lists recognizing the top 10 Most Influential Projects specific to a variety of regions and industries. In total, the lists celebrate over 250 breakthrough efforts that celebrated important milestones in the past 18 months.“The global pandemic has challenged all of us, disrupting the rhythms of our lives and forcing us to adapt to new realities,” reflects Sunil Prashara, President and CEO of Project Management Institute. “The projects honored in the 2020 edition of Most Influential Projects should give all of us cause for optimism in these tough times, as each team had to make hard decisions, often going against the grain of tradition — all for the betterment of society. As we rebuild, it is going to take innovation, collaboration and determination to make reality.”How have project managers helped make the year’s Most Influential Projects a reality? Here are three examples.Innovation to solve global problemsProject managers in South Korea innovated by adapting existing technology, despite multiple challenges, to develop Chollian-2B, an environmental satellite that measures the sources of air pollution and offers advanced weather forecasting.NASA and the European Space Agency are now planning to follow this model to learn how to mitigate the effects of air pollution on the environment and human health, showcasing how project management can inspire future initiatives. Air pollution's role in making some populations more susceptible to respiratory viruses like COVID-19 brings added urgency to this vital global endeavor.Collaboration for ambitious projectsMammoth projects require wide-spread collaboration, with project managers crucial to ensuring everyone works together successfully. One example is Learning Passport, a massive educational initiative requiring collaboration between educators, administrators and engineers.When the lockdown closed schools, roughly 1.7 billion children were impacted worldwide. While some regions quickly shifted to remote learning through digital education tools, many children in economically and technologically challenged regions struggled.That’s when a pilot project, Learning Passport, ventured into new territory to help. Originally a partnership between global organizations to assist displaced and refugee children, Learning Passport was adapted to meet the new demands of students in underprivileged and remote areas.A team of project managers rallied for rapid deployment of Learning Passport, customizing it wherever it was used — and collaborated with the different ecosystems to deliver content to support improved learning outcomes for children around the world.Determination to get the job done As COVID-19 began spreading, the U.S. Digital Response (USDR) project mobilized software engineers to help local governments. The group — including three former U.S. Deputy Chief Technology Officers — recruited volunteer data scientists, interaction designers and project managers to help public agencies whose resources were stretched to a breaking point.In the first three months, the USDR was tapped for over 100 projects, from building a dashboard to track hospital-bed capacity for the Pennsylvania Department of Health to creating a system to connect volunteers with vulnerable populations needing groceries delivered.The response to the USDR’s call was astounding: Over 5,000 experts volunteered. USDR is now developing projects for food and housing security, plus digitizing government systems. Through its organized and determined team of volunteers, USDR's project managers show what’s possible when people mobilize for a common cause.2020 — and beyondThese projects and others celebrated by PMI emphasize the need to innovate at a breakneck pace, demonstrating that progress must take precedence over perfection to solve immediate problems. It is crucial for project leaders to break everyone out of their silos to achieve ambitious goals, as without collaboration from experts across disciplines and regions, progress would be impossible. And while times of crisis may tempt people to focus on the issues of the moment, the Most Influential Projects 2020 list highlights forward-thinking projects born from a determination to remake the world.To learn more about Most Influential Projects 2020, visit PMI.org/most-influential-projects."

More people working remotely and from home has led to a re-evaluation of lifestyles and future goals — at times shifting the focus to where people choose to live, and why.Many are exploring locations around the country with new priorities in mind, leading to growing interest in living in more rural areas. These new goals and values may just lead you to consider new frontiers where you could relocate your home or business.Fortunately, there are places like Casper, Wyoming, that have communities actively reaching out and welcoming new residents and companies.

            "body": "A gallon of milk. Cream for your coffee. A pat of butter. Whether you’re enjoying a yogurt on the go in the morning or family night at home with a cheese and veggie pizza, dairy has been an enjoyable and nutritious part of daily life for generations. Throughout that time, America’s dairy farm families have provided an essential service to nourish their communities, during good times or bad.Did you know those same dairy farmers are also taking care of the planet? America’s 34,000 dairy farm families are directly connected to the land and have a long history of care for the environment and responsible dairy production.Since 2007, the dairy industry worked together to reduce the carbon footprint of each gallon of milk by 19%, using 30% less water and 21% less land, as seen in the Journal of Animal Science (2017). Now, the Innovation Center for U.S. Dairy, established under the leadership of dairy farmers and dairy companies, set aggressive, industry-wide sustainability targets for 2050:Recognizing the challenges facing the planet, farmers across the U.S. are adopting conservation practices, caring for their cows, recycling water and even generating clean energy to help make dairy an environmental solution.One such farmer, Dirk Young of Twin Birch Dairy in Skaneateles, New York, maximizes his operation’s resources with a combination of climate-smart practices. He uses an anaerobic digester to make cow bedding and crop fertilizer out of cow manure, and he also partners with an environmental group to ensure the water quality of New York’s Finger Lakes meets the highest standards for his community. As a result, the water quality surrounding his dairy farm has improved downstream and upstream.For Lloyd and Daphne Holterman, healthy cows and a healthy planet go hand in hand at Watertown, Wisconsin’s Rosy-Lane Holsteins dairy. They improved their production so cows can produce more milk per pound of feed, and the farm has not used antibiotics on its milking herd in over seven years.Oregon’s largest dairy farm, Threemile Canyon Farms in Boardman, has little to no waste, thanks to its closed-loop system. Highlights from the dairy’s system: mint harvest byproducts are included in the cows’ feed; manure is used as fertilizer; and its anaerobic digester produces renewable natural gas. On the farm, it powers natural gas vehicles, which reduce fuel emissions by 80% compared to diesel fuel.U.S. dairy farmers recognize the challenges facing the planet require more than just individual action. That’s why the U.S. dairy community is building on a long-standing history of environmental stewardship and collaborating on ways to accelerate the pace of continuous improvement to become an environmental solution, laying the roadmap to responsibly feed families for generations to come."

            "body": "It’s always a good idea to commit to improving your well-being or creating healthy habits in the new year, but if you approach your resolutions as something you want to do versus something you should do, you’re much more likely to follow through on your goals. So, why not rethink the whole new year’s resolution premise? What have you always wanted to do, but never given yourself permission to spend time pursuing? Here are a couple nontraditional resolutions that you might actually want to stick to.1. Dance like nobody's watchingIn the comfort of your own living room, you don't have to worry about what you look like — literally, no one will be watching — so it’s easy to learn how to dance.Look for YouTube videos with tutorials on dancing and see what catches your interest! Whether it’s an old-fashioned Charleston or the Woah, you can enjoy the thrill of movement, alone or with your partner. You could even try a new dance each month to keep it fresh all year long — there are so many types, and there are guides all over the internet!Not only is dancing a ton of fun, it’s also a great form of exercise.2. Learn a new languageExploring a new language is enriching and fun — and it also keeps your brain active while allowing you to explore other cultures. Already know a bit about a language, but haven’t put your skills to good use since high school or college? What better resolution than to brush up on learning a language?Becoming fluent is a great way to boost your confidence, and it’s easy to get started with apps like Rosetta Stone. Rosetta Stone helps you get ready for real-world conversations by using a “Dynamic Immersion” approach with exercises that take advantage of the brain's natural language processing ability. In short, that means it helps you learn fast.Rosetta Stone offers 25 different languages for you to choose from. Their program is mobile-friendly, so keeping up with your learning will be a breeze.3. Boost your careerLooking to advance your career? These days, classes, training courses and certifications are right at your fingertips. Where to start, though?First, figure out what skills would help you develop an edge in the job market, allowing you to move ahead or even change careers. Second, seek out experts and companies in that field who can point you toward learning resources.Better yet, consider combining two resolutions into one. Learning a new language is one sure way to boost your resume. What countries does your company do business with? Who are your company’s business partners and customers? Learning their language can be a great way to stand out from the crowd when it comes to the next round of promotions.4. Plan future adventuresYes, most travel plans are on hold right now — especially international travel. But there’s no reason you can’t make a resolution to plan your next overseas adventure. Where have you always wanted to go? Research the area and make a plan to learn more about the geography, cuisine and history of that region. Prepare yourself for your future trip by learning how to speak like a local, understand the signage, and find your way around easily! Having time to plan and practice means you’ll be that much more prepared when you get there.5. Create culinary masterpiecesYou can start with a modest goal — like making more plant-based dishes or using healthier cooking methods. But why not expand your skills? Thanks to cable channels devoted to cooking, plus countless how-to’s on Instagram and YouTube, you can find classes and tutorials on making just about anything that sounds tasty — right in your own kitchen. Even better, if you’re planning a trip (see #4) in the future, why not match up your culinary ambitions with your plans, and try making one of the signature dishes native to your next destination?New Year's resolutions don't have to be all about putting yourself through grueling new regimens. Find resolutions that bring real enjoyment and meaning to your life, and they'll stick with you for even longer."

            "body": "by David PacittiArtificial intelligence (AI) is already deeply embedded in our world. Its use is inevitable, and so often discussed, that many — including visionary business personalities like Elon Musk and Jack Ma — default to arguing over its positive or negative implications. Of course, the story requires more nuance, especially when thinking about the use of AI in healthcare.I believe AI has the ability to positively transform how we care for patients. By enabling us to optimize efficiency, power new tools, and enhance collaboration, AI has opened up a world of possibilities in healthcare. These span from AI mental health chatbots such as the Woebot pioneered by Facebook and Stanford, to physician AI “companions” to help ease ever-increasing physician workloads. Different approaches to these companions have been pioneered by various companies, including my own, Siemens Healthineers.Further innovating and fully realizing AI’s promise of healthcare transformation requires harnessing the massive amounts of data at the healthcare system level — a major, three-part undertaking that includes: 1) partnerships between industry and hospitals and health systems, 2) significant financial investments, and 3) a focus on patient needs. These three elements must be linked together by dialogue between experts in the fields of medicine and technology. And only when these partners team up can true innovation occur.To be sure, this is a shift in the way many companies — including mine — have delivered on the promise of AI for customers. For a long time, we focused on technical improvements, such as making an MRI faster or a CT scan more accurate, or helping improve a particular workflow within an organization. And while these are important efforts, they don’t address the larger need to change and streamline the entire system. Having all three elements of the trifecta of investment, partnership, and human focus has the potential to yield exciting possibilities for how AI can help drive system-wide change.This type of collaboration and human-focused approach has also played an important role in investigating AI’s capabilities in addressing new and emerging threats, like the COVID-19 pandemic. From multinational companies to small startups, the healthcare industry has stepped up by putting significant investments behind the use of AI in addressing this global crisis. Siemens Healthineers, too, has worked with our collaboration partners in France, New York, Switzerland, and Canada to develop a new algorithm for use in chest CT imaging to help healthcare professionals more quickly and easily identify pneumonia and measure disease severity in patients with suspected COVID-19 infections.These are just a few examples of digital innovation resulting from shared investment and partnership with a focus on patient care.The possibilities of what may come as a result of shared investment, partnership, and focus on patient care are exciting, whether it’s the next new innovation from big tech collaborating with academia or the societal impact we are hoping to see with our new 10-year digital health partnership with Geisinger, a nationally recognized healthcare system in Pennsylvania. This partnership, which is one of our largest in North America, is aimed at improving the patient experience for residents and driving digital health collaborations, including AI-enabled applications.We are only beginning to truly realize the potential of AI and the power of collaboration in healthcare and beyond. And if we want AI in healthcare to indeed be inevitable, we must all have skin in the game.David Pacitti is President of Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc. and Head of the Americas at Siemens Healthineers.

Experts encourage maintaining a steady flow of fresh, quality air within your home to help slow the transmission of coronavirus.Proper air circulation is crucial in any home, because airflow regulates temperature and creates a more pleasant and safe breathing environment. By contrast, poor air circulation can actually endanger your health. In fact, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often two to five times higher than outdoor levels, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.Here’s how to improve the airflow in your home.Open your windowsOnly 57% percent of homeowners open their windows in the winter, according to a study conducted by Pella Windows and Doors. However, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state health departments agree — opening your windows is a simple way to help to reduce the spread of coronavirus.“Opening windows is one of the easiest and most affordable ways to encourage air flow and limit the spread of germs, and potentially COVID-19, within your home,” said Nicolle Picray, brand communications and public relations manager at Pella Windows &amp; Doors.The company says the simple act of opening windows for 15-20 minutes a day, even in the winter months, can not only help to slow the transmission of COVID-19, but it can deliver a powerful lift to physical and mental health, as well as help clear homes of indoor pollutants and odors.Turn on ceiling fansWhenever possible, keep fresh air circulating in your home. Turning on ceiling fans can keep air moving, and combined with opening windows, can help cross-ventilation.Check your air filterA dirty air filter will reduce clean airflow from your home’s heating and cooling system.

            "body": "Did you know that too much time spent looking at your smartphone, computer or TV can lead to symptoms of dry eye? If you are having blurry vision, gritty, scratchy or watery eyes, you might be one of the 30 million Americans with dry eye. And for a majority of those people, a complex disorder called Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD) is a root cause of dry eye symptoms.“While dry eye is more prevalent in older people, more young people are being diagnosed due to increased screen time, diet and other factors. There are many causes for dry eye, but it is important to understand conditions like Meibomian Gland Dysfunction and how to best find relief for symptoms,” said Dr. Whitney Hauser, optometrist and “The Dry Eye Coach”.Follow these tips to help ease the discomfort of dry eye and to determine if you need to talk to your eye doctor if symptoms persist and become more severe:1. Take breaks from your devicesIt is easy to lose track of screen time when the new normal includes relying on digital devices for everything from staying connected to your family, working and even ordering household necessities. Be sure to take breaks to give your eyes a rest and, most importantly, don’t forget to blink. Failing to blink regularly can contribute to drying out your eyes, so try following the 20/20/20 rule; look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes while reading or staring at devices and computers for prolonged periods of time.2. Make small changes to your lifestyle Taking care of your eyes in a variety of ways can help keep dry eye symptoms at bay. Small changes like wearing sunglasses outdoors to reduce exposure to wind and the sun, properly cleaning your contact lenses before inserting them if you wear weekly or monthly lenses, using a humidifier in your home and staying hydrated can help reduce dry eye symptoms.3. Use an over-the-counter eye drop for reliefOver-the-counter dry eye drops are a great option to replenish the eye’s natural moisture, especially for people with mild symptoms. One example, SYSTANE Complete®, can be used for the temporary relief of burning and irritation, and provides fast relief. This can be a convenient option because you can take it with you and alleviate symptoms no matter where you are.4. Make an appointment with your eye doctor If you’re having persistent visual fluctuations, irritation, watery eyes and dryness, you might have a condition called Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD). Consider making an appointment with an eye doctor to discuss in-office treatments like the Systane® iLux®. This device delivers direct and personalized treatment to blocked glands in your eyelids in just 8-12 minutes for both eyes.For more information on Meibomian Gland Dysfunction, visit www.GetToRootCause.com.Important Information for iLUX® Device:The iLUX® Device is used to heat and compress glands in the eyelids of adult patients with a specific type of dry eye, called Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD), also known as evaporative dry eye.Potential side effects may include eyelid/eye pain requiring stopping the treatment procedure, eyelid/eye irritation or inflammation, temporary reddening of the skin, and other eye symptoms (burning, stinging, tearing, itching, discharge, redness, feeling like there is something in the eye, changes in your vision, sensitivity to light).Ask your eye care professional for a complete list of safety information for the iLUX® Device.Dr. Hauser is a paid consultant for Alcon. © 2020 Alcon Inc. 9/20 US-ILU-2000130"

            "body": "As the country continues to navigate uncertainties surrounding COVID-19, it seems like there are new questions and decisions that pop up each day. What does heading back to school or work look like? How should my family commute in the safest way? How can I continue to minimize the risk of exposure when I’m surrounded by more people during the day?For someone with an underlying medical condition like diabetes, the risk of serious complications is greater if an individual does get sick with COVID.1 That means it is even more critical for people with diabetes to have the tools they need at home to manage their blood sugar safely.For individuals with diabetes who take insulin, managing their blood sugar is a delicate balancing act. If someone doesn’t take enough insulin, blood sugar could skyrocket after a meal. On the flip side, blood sugar could plummet because someone took too much insulin, didn’t eat as much as expected, engaged in rigorous physical activity, were under increased stress — or many other reasons. One misstep and they could land in the hospital due to very low blood sugar.Very low blood sugar, or severe hypoglycemia, occurs when blood sugar gets so low that there is a shortage of glucose to the brain. This can be extremely frightening and could result in a person passing out, having a seizure, going into a coma and, if left untreated, can be life-threatening. It is an emotionally scarring moment that stays with you for months, or even years. Severe hypoglycemia is an emergency that needs immediate attention.Until recently, the only medicine available to treat this kind of emergency was a kit that required many steps to prepare and use, making a scary situation even scarier. The process was so complicated that only about 30% of people were able to use it correctly.2 The result was that many people decided to not even get a prescription for the kit. Instead, they told family, friends or coworkers to call 9-1-1 if their blood sugar dropped too low.Now, Gvoke HypoPen™ (glucagon injection) is available — the first premixed autoinjector for very low blood sugar. Gvoke HypoPen is simple to administer, so anyone can use it. People with diabetes can even give it to themselves in certain situations. And it is a proven method of delivery — 99% of people were able to use Gvoke HypoPen correctly.2Just as someone with severe allergies would carry an epinephrine pen to deliver medicine quickly and effectively after an insect sting or allergic reaction to food, ready-to-use Gvoke HypoPen can also give confidence in a potentially life-threatening moment.Stress and erratic schedules (what many are experiencing as a result of COVID-19) can increase the risk for very low blood sugar in people with diabetes.3-4 More than ever, someone with diabetes needs a tool they can be confident in using if they have a very low blood sugar event.If you have diabetes and are on insulin, you have most likely had a low blood sugar event where you were worried you might pass out. With Gvoke HypoPen™, you now have a tool that can help turn a potential crisis moment into a manageable situation.Don’t wait until after a scary situation to talk to your doctor about new options for treating very low blood sugar, like Gvoke HypoPen. Talk to your doctor now or visit GvokeGlucagon.com to learn more. Add one to your daily diabetes kit and keep another in a spot where you can get to it quickly. Get in the habit of telling others where you keep your glucagon and how to use it, just in case you can't get to it yourself.INDICATION AND SAFETY SUMMARYGVOKE is a prescription medicine used to treat very low blood sugar (severe hypoglycemia) in adults and kids with diabetes ages 2 years and above.

            "body": "Even if you work out regularly, chances are you’d like to see more results in terms of muscle strength and tone. It’s easy to get stuck in an exercise rut, where you keep doing the same thing and don’t see much improvement. Feel like you’re hitting a plateau?If you want real results and just aren’t getting there, here are some different tips for taking your body contouring goals further.Boost your cardio workoutIf you’re focused on strength and just phoning in your cardio workouts, don’t forget that overall muscle strength—including that most important muscle, your heart—and general health benefits from intense workouts that get you up and moving.[1] Vary workouts to challenge yourself. Try something new like rowing, dancing, cycling, or swimming to jump-start your routine.Consider a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workout for better calorie- and fat-burning results.[2] HIIT workouts alternate short bursts of intense exercise such as sprints—around 45 seconds to a few minutes—followed by an equal period of moderate exercise or rest. Combining HIIT with moderate exercise has been shown to improve health/lung health.[3]Switch up your strength routineConsult a trainer to make sure you’re doing exercises that activate all the main muscle groups of your body, including your glutes and those essential core muscles, so you get those toned abs you want.Challenge yourself by adding free weights, kettle bells, or calisthenics you aren’t currently doing, 2-3 times per week. Give those muscles time to rest between strength-training days, or alternate days working one muscle group with another to give those muscles recovery time.[4]Consider adding routines combining strength with flexibility, such as Pilates, barre, or yoga, as these may help improve your posture and appearance.Body contouring can help take muscle strength and tone furtherIn addition to cardio and strength training, CoolTone™ by CoolSculpting® can help you strengthen and tone your muscles using Magnetic Muscle Stimulation (MMS) technology, which penetrates into the muscle layers and induces involuntary muscle contractions your body could not otherwise achieve on its own. CoolTone™ is an FDA-cleared device used in-office to strengthen, tone, and firm muscles of your abdomen, buttocks, and thighs.It is recommended that patients receive 4 treatments over 2 consecutive weeks. Patients generally see results after 4 treatments, but the number of treatments it takes to see results will depend on each person and the area being treated. Your healthcare provider can provide a plan to help you reach your body contouring goals. After the treatments, your abs and buttocks will feel tighter and have a more defined and toned appearance. Treatments take about 30 minutes per area.“An appropriate candidate for CoolTone™ is someone generally close to their ideal body weight, does not have a contraindication to treatment, and is looking to improve strength and tone in their abdomen, buttocks, or thighs,” said Dr. Sabrina Guillen Fabi, MD, a board-certified dermatologist and an assistant clinical professor at the University of California, San Diego. She also said that patients were excited to see a change in their abdomen after the last of 4 treatment sessions.Dr. Fabi, who was involved with clinical trials for CoolTone™, shared, “CoolTone™ treatment can help improve patients’ strength and definition in the treated area. I see this treatment as an addition to one's overall healthy lifestyle.”If you’re interested in taking your body contouring goals further with CoolTone™, visit https://coolscul.pt/2RNaYKw to find a provider near you.UsesThe CoolTone™ device is FDA-cleared for improvement of abdominal tone, strengthening of the abdominal muscles, and development for a firmer abdomen. CoolTone™ is also FDA-cleared for strengthening, toning, and firming of buttocks and thighs.Important Safety InformationThe CoolTone™ procedure is not for everyone. You should not have the CoolTone™ treatment in areas with metal, electrical, or electronic implants/devices like cardiac pacemakers, implanted hearing devices, implanted defibrillators, implanted neurostimulators, drug pumps, or hearing aids.Tell your doctor if you have any medical conditions as CoolTone™ should not be used over a menstruating uterus, over areas of the skin that lack normal sensation, in patients with fever, malignant tumor, hemorrhagic conditions, epilepsy, recent surgical procedure, pulmonary insufficiency, or pregnancy.CoolTone™ should be used with caution in patients with Graves’ disease (an autoimmune disorder that causes overactive thyroid), active bleeding disorders, or seizure disorders.Women who are close to menstruation may find that it comes sooner, or cramping is increased or intensified with CoolTone™ treatments, therefore, it is recommended to not undergo treatment during this time of the month.CoolTone™ should not be used in the heart or head areas, areas of new bone growth, over the carotid sinus nerves, or over the neck or mouth.

It’s easy to get stuck in an exercise rut, where you keep doing the same thing and don’t see much improvement. Feel like you’re hitting a plateau?</p><p>If you want real results and just aren’t getting there, here are some different tips for taking your body contouring goals further.</p><p><strong>Boost your cardio workout</strong></p><p>If you’re focused on strength and just phoning in your cardio workouts, don’t forget that overall muscle strength—including that most important muscle, your heart—and general health benefits from intense workouts that get you up and moving.<a rel=\"nofollow\" name=\"_ftnref1\"></a><a href=\"https://hub.brandpoint.com/#_ftn1\" rel=\"nofollow\">[1]</a> Vary workouts to challenge yourself. Try something new like rowing, dancing, cycling, or swimming to jump-start your routine.</p><p>Consider a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workout for better calorie- and fat-burning results.<a rel=\"nofollow\" name=\"_ftnref2\"></a><a href=\"https://hub.brandpoint.com/#_ftn2\" rel=\"nofollow\">[2]</a> HIIT workouts alternate short bursts of intense exercise such as sprints—around 45 seconds to a few minutes—followed by an equal period of moderate exercise or rest. Combining HIIT with moderate exercise has been shown to improve health/lung health.<a rel=\"nofollow\" name=\"_ftnref3\"></a><a href=\"https://hub.brandpoint.com/#_ftn3\" rel=\"nofollow\">[3]</a></p><p><strong>Switch up your strength routine</strong></p><p>Consult a trainer to make sure you’re doing exercises that activate all the main muscle groups of your body, including your glutes and those essential core muscles, so you get those toned abs you want.</p><p>Challenge yourself by adding free weights, kettle bells, or calisthenics you aren’t currently doing, 2-3 times per week. Give those muscles time to rest between strength-training days, or alternate days working one muscle group with another to give those muscles recovery time.<a rel=\"nofollow\" name=\"_ftnref4\"></a><a href=\"https://hub.brandpoint.com/#_ftn4\" rel=\"nofollow\">[4]</a></p><p>Consider adding routines combining strength with flexibility, such as Pilates, barre, or yoga, as these may help improve your posture and appearance.</p><p><strong>Body contouring can help take muscle strength and tone further</strong></p><p>In addition to cardio and strength training, <a href=\"https://www.coolsculpting.com/cooltone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CoolTone™</a> by CoolSculpting<sup>®</sup> can help you strengthen and tone your muscles using Magnetic Muscle Stimulation (MMS) technology, which penetrates into the muscle layers and induces involuntary muscle contractions your body could not otherwise achieve on its own. CoolTone™ is an FDA-cleared device used in-office to strengthen, tone, and firm muscles of your abdomen, buttocks, and thighs.</p><p>It is recommended that patients receive 4 treatments over 2 consecutive weeks. Patients generally see results after 4 treatments, but the number of treatments it takes to see results will depend on each person and the area being treated. Your healthcare provider can provide a plan to help you reach your body contouring goals. After the treatments, your abs and buttocks will feel tighter and have a more defined and toned appearance. Treatments take about 30 minutes per area.</p><p>“An appropriate candidate for CoolTone™ is someone generally close to their ideal body weight, does not have a contraindication to treatment, and is looking to improve strength and tone in their abdomen, buttocks, or thighs,” said Dr. Sabrina Guillen Fabi, MD, a board-certified dermatologist and an assistant clinical professor at the University of California, San Diego. She also said that patients were excited to see a change in their abdomen after the last of 4 treatment sessions.</p><p>Dr. Fabi, who was involved with clinical trials for CoolTone™, shared, “CoolTone™ treatment can help improve patients’ strength and definition in the treated area. I see this treatment as an addition to one's overall healthy lifestyle.”</p><p>If you’re interested in taking your body contouring goals further with CoolTone™, visit <a href=\"https://coolscul.pt/2RNaYKw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://coolscul.pt/2RNaYKw</a> to find a provider near you.</p><p><strong>Uses</strong></p><p>The CoolTone™ device is FDA-cleared for improvement of abdominal tone, strengthening of the abdominal muscles, and development for a firmer abdomen.

            "body": "In the spring of 2016, Kate was excitedly preparing for the rites of passage most high school seniors look forward to — prom, graduation, turning 18 and getting ready for college. What she wasn’t preparing for was a chronic illness diagnosis.It started out as a small patch of dry skin on Kate’s neck that began to spread to her scalp in thick, red patches. This must be an allergic reaction, Kate thought, before seeking help at an urgent care center. There, a physician suggested the patches were a fungal rash and recommended special shampoos. But the patches soon covered large areas of her scalp and neck, and were now accompanied by a painful, burning sensation. Kate spent many days trying to hide her patches from other people.Kate visited a dermatologist who prescribed another treatment option, but unfortunately it didn’t relieve her symptoms. As her condition worsened, she saw other specialists, hoping to find some relief. But her symptoms persisted.Now, Kate had to prepare to go off to college while still searching for answers about this unknown condition.“Starting college is hard enough — living in a new place, meeting new people, starting new classes and activities,” said Kate. “I was focused on trying to hide what was happening to my body. I started wearing a baseball cap and avoided wearing dark clothing.”Kate was determined to get to the bottom of what was going on with her skin. After multiple visits to several different dermatologists, a biopsy finally revealed the truth — Kate had moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.Plaque psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease and its exact cause is unknown. Research suggests that an overactive immune system may cause skin cells to pile up on the surface of the skin, which then form psoriasis lesions or plaques and can lead to physical pain, itching, skin tightness and a burning sensation.1More than 8 million Americans are currently living with psoriasis,2 and plaque psoriasis is the most common form.3 Now that Kate had a proper diagnosis of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, her next step was to find the right treatment. The first two treatments prescribed to her provided some skin clearance.However, finishing her freshman year at college, Kate was still concerned about her skin plaques. Then, that summer, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a medication called TREMFYA® (guselkumab), a biologic treatment that selectively blocks a protein in the body called interleukin-23 (IL-23), one of the key proteins thought to be responsible for plaque psoriasis.TREMFYA® is approved to treat adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who may benefit from taking injections or pills (systemic therapy) or phototherapy (treatment using ultraviolet or UV light). In clinical studies, at least 7 out of 10 patients treated with TREMFYA® saw 90 percent clearer skin and more than 8 out of 10 were rated clear or almost clear after 16 weeks. In clinical studies at Week 16, 4 out of 5 people with scalp psoriasis were also rated clear or almost clear of their scalp psoriasis. Also, more patients had improvement in symptoms such as pain, stinging, and skin tightness.The medicine comes in both a pre-filled syringe and a One-Press Patient Controlled injector. Your first self-injection should be performed at your dermatologist’s office so they can show you the right way to give yourself injections under the skin. After this training, and with your healthcare provider’s approval, you may be able to inject TREMFYA® under the skin at home every eight weeks after two starter doses at Week 0 and Week 4.“I was amazed by the results,” said Kate. “I am so happy I started on TREMFYA®. I inject my medication every 8 weeks and I’m pleased to share my journey to achieving clearer skin. I know now that my psoriasis doesn’t define me.”Results may vary. TREMFYA® may not be right for everyone. Only your doctor can decide if TREMFYA® is right for you.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONWhat is the most important information I should know about TREMFYA®?TREMFYA® is a prescription medicine that may cause serious side effects, including:Do not take TREMFYA® if you have had a serious allergic reaction to guselkumab or any of the ingredients in TREMFYA®.Before using TREMFYA®, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you:Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.What are the possible side effects of TREMFYA®?TREMFYA® may cause serious side effects.

            "body": "The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant disruption in cancer care and treatment.1 As the leading cause of cancer death in the US, the potential impact on lung cancer is especially alarming.2,3 Recent studies predict a significant increase in the number of cancer deaths over the next five years due to missed screenings, delays in diagnosis and reductions in oncology care caused by COVID-19.3,4While part of this disruption is due to the reduction and suspension of screening programs and diagnostic services caused by the reallocation of medical staff and resources to fight the pandemic, there are also other important factors at play.1 Nationwide stay-at-home orders, job and/or insurance loss and general fear of exposure to the virus during a doctor visit have resulted in people postponing care for non-COVID-19 health concerns, or foregoing it altogether.1,6 As a result of these factors, although individuals across the US are still getting lung cancer, more people are going undiagnosed until the cancer has reached an advanced stage.5“What we are seeing in our practice is that people are not coming in for anything unless they absolutely have to,” said Joyce Knestrick, PhD, FNP-BC, FAANP. “They don’t want to go to any screenings. They don’t want to go to any hospital settings to be exposed to COVID.”Many medical conditions, including lung cancer, will not “wait” for the pandemic to end. Putting off diagnosis and treatment may have significant negative effects on patient outcomes.5“In my experience, if they don’t know they have a diagnosis they are not going to seek it out unless they are really sick anyway. That’s why I am really worried about the burden on the system when people come in at different levels,” Joyce continued.Lung Cancer: There’s No Pause ButtonCancer does not discriminate, and its consequences are not pausing even if the world is.Despite relatively stable lung cancer diagnoses rates for 13 months prior to the pandemic,7* states with a particularly high prevalence of lung cancer where the decline is most notable and severely affected by COVID-19— New York, California, Texas, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Michigan and Ohio— have since seen a 30-60% reduction in such diagnoses as of May 2020.This sharp decline does not mean fewer people are developing lung cancer. Instead, quite the opposite: more individuals are going undiagnosed and delay treatment until their cancers advance.8While some individuals with early lung cancer can have symptoms, many do not until the disease spreads. An added challenge is some symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath and fatigue may mimic those of COVID-19.10,11If lung cancer symptoms are noticed sooner rather than later, or people at known risk seek medical care, it might be diagnosed and treated more effectively at an earlier stage.“I think this is a challenging time for all of us, but we are all in this together,” said Nanette Alexander, DNP, APRN, FAANP. “We want to minimize what they need for care, and early intervention does that.”Reassuring Patients: The Time Can STILL Be NowIt is critical for people at risk for lung cancer, or with potential symptoms, to stay connected with their health care providers and learn how to best seek care given the situation. Even in the face of a global pandemic, concerns should not be put on hold.Hospitals and clinics are doing all they can to ensure the health and safety of patients during the pandemic. Ultimately, the risk of COVID-19 must be balanced against the risk to the patient of lung cancer progression, and in most cases, lung cancer still represents a greater risk of mortality for patients.3,12“When your providers say it is safe to go back, go back,” Nanette concluded.For more information on cancer and COVID-19, visit covid19cancerresources.com.*Compared to the average lung cancer diagnosis rates from Jan '19 to Feb '20.1.

            "html": "<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant disruption in cancer care and treatment.<sup>1</sup> As the leading cause of cancer death in the US, the potential impact on lung cancer is especially alarming.<sup>2,3</sup> Recent studies predict a significant increase in the number of cancer deaths over the next five years due to missed screenings, delays in diagnosis and reductions in oncology care caused by COVID-19.<sup>3,4</sup></p><p>While part of this disruption is due to the reduction and suspension of screening programs and diagnostic services caused by the reallocation of medical staff and resources to fight the pandemic, there are also other important factors at play.<sup>1</sup> Nationwide stay-at-home orders, job and/or insurance loss and general fear of exposure to the virus during a doctor visit have resulted in people postponing care for non-COVID-19 health concerns, or foregoing it altogether.<sup>1,6</sup> As a result of these factors, although individuals across the US are still getting lung cancer, more people are going undiagnosed until the cancer has reached an advanced stage.<sup>5</sup></p><p>“What we are seeing in our practice is that people are not coming in for anything unless they absolutely have to,” said Joyce Knestrick, PhD, FNP-BC, FAANP. “They don’t want to go to any screenings. They don’t want to go to any hospital settings to be exposed to COVID.”</p><p>Many medical conditions, including lung cancer, will not “wait” for the pandemic to end. Putting off diagnosis and treatment may have significant negative effects on patient outcomes.<sup>5</sup></p><p>“In my experience, if they don’t know they have a diagnosis they are not going to seek it out unless they are really sick anyway. That’s why I am really worried about the burden on the system when people come in at different levels,” Joyce continued.</p><p><strong>Lung Cancer: There’s No Pause Button</strong></p><p>Cancer does not discriminate, and its consequences are not pausing even if the world is.</p><p>Despite relatively stable lung cancer diagnoses rates for 13 months prior to the pandemic,<sup>7*</sup> states with a particularly high prevalence of lung cancer where the decline is most notable and severely affected by COVID-19— New York, California, Texas, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Michigan and Ohio— have since seen a 30-60% reduction in such diagnoses as of May 2020.</p><p>This sharp decline does not mean fewer people are developing lung cancer. Instead, quite the opposite: more individuals are going undiagnosed and delay treatment until their cancers advance.<sup>8</sup></p><p>While some individuals with early lung cancer can have symptoms, many do not until the disease spreads. An added challenge is some symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath and fatigue may mimic those of COVID-19.<sup>10,11</sup></p><p>If lung cancer symptoms are noticed sooner rather than later, or people at known risk seek medical care, it might be diagnosed and treated more effectively at an earlier stage.</p><p>“I think this is a challenging time for all of us, but we are all in this together,” said Nanette Alexander, DNP, APRN, FAANP. “We want to minimize what they need for care, and early intervention does that.”</p><p><strong>Reassuring Patients: The Time Can STILL Be Now</strong></p><p>It is critical for people at risk for lung cancer, or with potential symptoms, to stay connected with their health care providers and learn how to best seek care given the situation. Even in the face of a global pandemic, concerns should not be put on hold.</p><p>Hospitals and clinics are doing all they can to ensure the health and safety of patients during the pandemic. Ultimately, the risk of COVID-19 must be balanced against the risk to the patient of lung cancer progression, and in most cases, lung cancer still represents a greater risk of mortality for patients.<sup>3,12</sup></p><p>“When your providers say it is safe to go back, go back,” Nanette concluded.</p><p>For more information on cancer and COVID-19<insert title=\"Inserted by Kat Vega - 09/29/2020 2:56pm\" class=\"ins cts-1\" data-cid=\"43\" data-userid=\"16505\" data-username=\"Kat Vega\" data-time=\"1601409373833\">,</insert> visit <a href=\"https://www.covid19cancerresources.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">covid19cancerresources.com</a><span style=\"text-align: left; color: #000000; text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; float: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;\">.</span></p><p><span style=\"text-align: left; color: #000000; text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; float: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;\"></span></p><p><em>*Compared to the average lung cancer diagnosis rates from Jan '19 to Feb '20.</em></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 9.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;\">1.

            "body": "If you’re over the age of 40 and heading to the bathroom with increasing urgency and frequency or trying to avoid leakage, you could be experiencing symptoms of overactive bladder or “OAB”.[1],2 Urgency (feeling like you can’t make it to the toilet in time), frequency (having to pee more than usual during the day) and leakage are all symptoms of OAB”.[2] If any of these symptoms seem familiar to you, talk to your medical provider who can conduct a thorough assessment of your bladder health.2Nearly 30 million Americans 40 years of age and older experience OAB symptoms.1 OAB can impact both men and women, but it’s more common in women.1 “I hit this point in my life when I was nearing 50 where I started feeling like I was constantly using the restroom,” said Lynne, a patient with OAB who lives in Southern California. “But I finally brought it up with my doctor at my annual exam since I was feeling so frustrated.”Here are some facts to understand about OAB.One difficult aspect of addressing bladder issues can be bringing it up in the first place.3 Changes in bladder control can often be accompanied by shame or embarrassment for many, causing those who suffer to put off treatment or keep it a secret.3In Lynne’s case, she was eventually diagnosed with overactive bladder and started a treatment plan. “My doctor prescribed a treatment called Myrbetriq, which has helped me manage my OAB symptoms,” Lynne said. Myrbetriq, also known as mirabegron, was FDA approved in 2012 and is indicated for the treatment of OAB with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency and urinary frequency. It helps the bladder store urine.[5]“I’m a beach lover and enjoy travel,” continued Lynne. “Feeling tethered to the bathroom makes it difficult to leave the house or go on long trips which was a non-starter for me. I decided enough was enough. Emotionally, I felt a sense of relief once I had that conversation with my doctor. From that point forward I felt empowered rather than ashamed.”To get thinking about your ‘peehavior’, visit myrbetriq.com for more information and to access a tool that can help facilitate a discussion with your doctor.A qualified health care professional can evaluate any changes to your symptoms and recommend the appropriate course of treatment to best meet your needs.Use of MyrbetriqMyrbetriq® (mirabegron) is a prescription medicine for adults used to treat overactive bladder (OAB) with symptoms of urgency, frequency and leakage.Important Safety InformationMyrbetriq is not for everyone. Do not take Myrbetriq if you have an allergy to mirabegron or any ingredients in Myrbetriq. Myrbetriq may cause your blood pressure to increase or make your blood pressure worse if you have a history of high blood pressure. It is recommended that your doctor check your blood pressure while you are taking Myrbetriq. Myrbetriq may increase your chances of not being able to empty your bladder. Tell your doctor right away if you have trouble emptying your bladder or you have a weak urine stream.Myrbetriq may cause allergic reactions that may be serious. If you experience swelling of the face, lips, throat or tongue, with or without difficulty breathing, stop taking Myrbetriq and tell your doctor right away.Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take including medications for overactive bladder or other medicines such as thioridazine (Mellaril™ and Mellaril-S™), flecainide (Tambocor®), propafenone (Rythmol®), digoxin (Lanoxin®) or solifenacin succinate (VESIcare®). Myrbetriq may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how Myrbetriq works.Before taking Myrbetriq, tell your doctor if you have liver or kidney problems. The most common side effects of Myrbetriq include increased blood pressure, common cold symptoms (nasopharyngitis), dry mouth, flu symptoms, urinary tract infection, back pain, dizziness, joint pain, headache, constipation, sinus irritation, and inflammation of the bladder (cystitis).For further information, please talk to your healthcare professional and see accompanying Patient Product Information and complete Prescribing Information for Myrbetriq® (mirabegron).You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.

            "summary": "",
            "body": "The statistics around pancreatic cancer are grim. In the US this year, more than 57,000 people will be diagnosed and approximately 47,000 will die from the disease. Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death, with a five-year survival rate of 10% across all stages.However, the five-year survival rate has slowly risen from just 6% in 2006. As researchers learn more about this devastating disease, they are discovering more about the role of genetic mutations – abnormal changes in genes – in the development and treatment of pancreatic cancer. Specifically, changes in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, genes that all men and women are born with, have been linked to an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. The good news is that knowing whether a patient with pancreatic cancer has a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation can help inform treatment decisions.Whether you have a family history of pancreatic cancer or have been recently diagnosed, here are five key things to understand about this disease and the role genetics can play.1. Why is the prognosis for advanced pancreatic cancer typically poor?Pancreatic cancer is difficult to detect in the early stages, as early-stage tumors typically cannot be felt or seen during routine check-ups. Often there are no symptoms until the cancer has reached an advanced stage. More than 50% of patients are diagnosed at the metastatic stage, meaning the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. At this stage, there are limited treatment options and typically poor outcomes.2. What are BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes and why are they important in pancreatic cancer?We all inherit BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes from our parents. Under normal circumstances, these genes suppress tumor growth by producing proteins to help repair damaged DNA and keep the body’s genetic material stable. However, if BRCA genes become altered, they may no longer be able to help suppress tumors, leading to an increased risk of certain types of cancer. BRCA gene mutations may be inherited (carried in the germline) or somatic (acquired and located only in the tumor).While breast and ovarian cancers are more commonly associated with these mutations, many people may be unaware that the risk of pancreatic cancer is increased in people with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Studies have shown that 4-7% of pancreatic cancer patients harbor a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Those with pancreatic cancer who are of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry are even more likely to carry a BRCA mutation.3. How do I find out if I have a BRCA mutation?Whether or not you have been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, a blood or saliva test can determine if you carry an inherited BRCA gene mutation that puts you at increased risk for developing pancreatic and other cancers. Knowing if these mutations exist can also help to better inform diagnosed pancreatic cancer patients of treatment options and why they might respond to some treatments over others.“Every patient is different, so testing for genetic mutations at diagnosis is important for metastatic pancreatic cancer patients because it can help doctors determine a personalized treatment plan,” said Julie Fleshman, JD, MBA, president and CEO of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (PanCAN). “PanCAN strongly recommends that all pancreatic cancer patients undergo genetic testing for inherited mutations and biomarker testing of their tumor tissue to help them and their healthcare team make informed treatment decisions.”4. What are the treatment options for advanced pancreatic cancer?There have been limited treatment advances for pancreatic cancer over the last few years. In pancreatic cancer, only 10-20% of patients are eligible for surgery. In patients whose cancer cannot be removed surgically, chemotherapy is typically given. There is an approved treatment option for patients with an inherited BRCA gene mutation and with metastatic pancreatic cancer.LYNPARZA® (olaparib), a type of drug known as a PARP (poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase) inhibitor, was approved in December 2019 by the US Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for metastatic pancreatic cancer with an inherited BRCA gene mutation. LYNPARZA is used as a maintenance treatment after the cancer has not progressed during at least 16 weeks of treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. Your healthcare provider will perform a test to make sure that LYNPARZA is right for you. This test, a companion diagnostic for LYNPARZA, is the FDA-approved diagnostic to determine which patients are eligible for treatment with LYNPARZA.The availability of this treatment supports the value of testing patients with pancreatic cancer for germline (inherited) BRCA mutations, as it offers a personalized biomarker-led approach for the maintenance treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer. Previously, there were no approved biomarker-directed treatment options. LYNPARZA is the only approved targeted medicine for biomarker-selected advanced pancreatic cancer patients (those who test positive for a germline BRCA mutation). For more information, visit LYNPARZA.com.LYNPARZA may cause serious side effects, including bone marrow problems called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and lung problems (pneumonitis). Tell your doctor if you experience any new or worsening symptoms of lung problems, including shortness of breath, fever, cough, or wheezing. See full Important Safety Information below.5. What resources are available for people with pancreatic cancer?It’s important for pancreatic cancer patients and their caregivers to learn about the disease and have a support system. The Pancreatic Action Network (PanCAN), a leading patient advocacy and research organization founded in 1999, provides free, in-depth, personalized resources on pancreatic cancer, including one-to-one support from expert case managers, educational materials, clinical trial information and even molecular profiling.“A diagnosis of pancreatic cancer can be scary and confusing, and people may be unsure where to turn, so PanCAN’s Patient Services is here to help,” said Fleshman. “Knowledge and a strong support system will help empower patients to be their own best advocate and ensure they’re asking the right questions about their treatment options.”If you or a loved one are newly diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, it is important to talk to your care team about BRCA mutation testing and how the results could inform your future treatment decisions.

            "html": "<p>The statistics around pancreatic cancer are grim. In the US this year, more than 57,000 people will be diagnosed and approximately 47,000 will die from the disease. Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death, with a five-year survival rate of 10% across all stages.</p><p>However, the five-year survival rate has slowly risen from just 6% in 2006. As researchers learn more about this devastating disease, they are discovering more about the role of genetic mutations – abnormal changes in genes – in the development and treatment of pancreatic cancer. Specifically, changes in the <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> genes, genes that all men and women are born with, have been linked to an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. The good news is that knowing whether a patient with pancreatic cancer has a <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> mutation can help inform treatment decisions.</p><p>Whether you have a family history of pancreatic cancer or have been recently diagnosed, here are five key things to understand about this disease and the role genetics can play.</p><p><strong>1. Why is the prognosis for advanced pancreatic cancer typically poor?</strong></p><p>Pancreatic cancer is difficult to detect in the early stages, as early-stage tumors typically cannot be felt or seen during routine check-ups. Often there are no symptoms until the cancer has reached an advanced stage. More than 50% of patients are diagnosed at the metastatic stage, meaning the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. At this stage, there are limited treatment options and typically poor outcomes.</p><p><strong>2. </strong><strong>What are <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> genes and why are they important in pancreatic cancer?</strong></p><p>We all inherit <em>BRCA1 </em>and<em> BRCA2 </em>genes from our parents. Under normal circumstances, these genes suppress tumor growth by producing proteins to help repair damaged DNA and keep the body’s genetic material stable. However, if <em>BRCA</em> genes become altered, they may no longer be able to help suppress tumors, leading to an increased risk of certain types of cancer. <em>BRCA</em> gene mutations may be inherited (carried in the germline) or somatic (acquired and located only in the tumor).</p><p>While breast and ovarian cancers are more commonly associated with these mutations, many people may be unaware that the risk of pancreatic cancer is increased in people with <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> mutations. Studies have shown that 4-7% of pancreatic cancer patients harbor a <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> mutation. Those with pancreatic cancer who are of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry are even more likely to carry a <em>BRCA </em>mutation.</p><p><strong>3. How do I find out if I have a <em>BRCA</em> mutation?</strong></p><p>Whether or not you have been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, a blood or saliva test can determine if you carry an inherited <em>BRCA</em> gene mutation that puts you at increased risk for developing pancreatic and other cancers. Knowing if these mutations exist can also help to better inform diagnosed pancreatic cancer patients of treatment options and why they might respond to some treatments over others.</p><p>“Every patient is different, so testing for genetic mutations at diagnosis is important for metastatic pancreatic cancer patients because it can help doctors determine a personalized treatment plan,” said Julie Fleshman, JD, MBA, president and CEO of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (PanCAN). “PanCAN strongly recommends that all pancreatic cancer patients undergo genetic testing for inherited mutations and biomarker testing of their tumor tissue to help them and their healthcare team make informed treatment decisions.”</p><p><strong>4. What are the treatment options for advanced pancreatic cancer?</strong></p><p>There have been limited treatment advances for pancreatic cancer over the last few years. In pancreatic cancer, only 10-20% of patients are eligible for surgery. In patients whose cancer cannot be removed surgically, chemotherapy is typically given. There is an approved treatment option for patients with an inherited <em>BRCA</em> gene mutation and with metastatic pancreatic cancer.</p><p>LYNPARZA<sup>®</sup> (olaparib), a type of drug known as a PARP (poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase) inhibitor, was approved in December 2019 by the US Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for metastatic pancreatic cancer with an inherited <em>BRCA </em>gene mutation. LYNPARZA is used as a maintenance treatment after the cancer has not progressed during at least 16 weeks of treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. Your healthcare provider will perform a test to make sure that LYNPARZA is right for you. This test, a companion diagnostic for LYNPARZA, is the FDA-approved diagnostic to determine which patients are eligible for treatment with LYNPARZA.</p><p>The availability of this treatment supports the value of testing patients with pancreatic cancer for germline (inherited) <em>BRCA</em> mutations, as it offers a personalized biomarker-led approach for the maintenance treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer. Previously, there were no approved biomarker-directed treatment options. LYNPARZA is the only approved targeted medicine for biomarker-selected advanced pancreatic cancer patients (those who test positive for a germline <em>BRCA</em> mutation).

            "body": "When Patti, a busy 64-year-old mother and grandmother, was diagnosed with thyroid disease in the late 1990s, she figured treating it would be the end of her issues. It took about a year, but Patti’s weakness, fatigue and high heartrate finally subsided and her thyroid levels normalized – she was in the clear, or so she thought.Four or five years after her thyroid disease diagnosis, Patti started experiencing eye symptoms she’d never had before, like eye bulging, excessive watering, dry eye and an inability to fully shut her eyes while she slept. Patti eventually met with an ophthalmologist who diagnosed her with Thyroid Eye Disease (TED), a rare but vision-threatening autoimmune disease.In people with TED, the immune system attacks the muscle and fat tissue behind the eye, causing it to become inflamed and swollen. TED most often occurs in people with Graves’ disease or Hashimoto’s hyperthyroidism, but sometimes the symptoms of TED, such as eye pain, redness, double vision, light sensitivity and eye bulging, will be the first reason someone visits their doctor. Until recently, there were no medicines approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of TED, leaving many patients to feel helpless.Over the years, Patti’s eye symptoms worsened, and she bounced from ophthalmologist to ophthalmologist trying to find relief. It wasn’t until she started having double vision that Patti knew it was time to take her TED seriously and consider possible treatment options.In the summer of 2019, Patti underwent orbital decompression surgery to relieve pressure behind her eyes. After her surgeon left the practice she was being treated at, Patti was referred to Dr. Erik Happ, an ophthalmologist with Allegheny Ophthalmic and Orbital Associates in Pittsburgh. Dr. Happ recommended Patti look into a recent advancement called TEPEZZA (teprotumumab-trbw), the first and only FDA-approved medicine for TED.“TEPEZZA is changing the way doctors treat Thyroid Eye Disease,” says Happ. “As the first treatment of its kind, TEPEZZA has been shown to reduce eye bulging and double vision and improve the signs and symptoms of TED, including eye pain, redness and swelling. For many patients, just knowing they have a nonsurgical option provides a sense of hope.”TEPEZZA is an intravenous medicine, also known as an IV medicine – meaning it’s delivered through a needle in a person’s arm under supervision by a medical professional. TEPEZZA is given to patients once every three weeks for a total of eight infusions, with a full course of treatment with TEPEZZA lasting about five months.After finishing her treatment, Patti is now enjoying comfort in her eyes and a new confidence. “Living with TED is emotionally distressing, and the eye bulging was embarrassing,” she says. “While treatment can seem like a long journey, it was so worth it for me.”In honor of the first TED Awareness Week beginning November 16, Dr. Happ offers the following tips and information to help TED patients.Be your own advocateIdentifying and monitoring TED symptoms is key to managing this disease. Without proper care, TED can get worse over time and can lead to blindness in some cases, so it’s important to talk to a TED Specialist about your risk for TED.When describing symptoms to your doctor, remember to mention how they’re affecting your life, such as causing difficulty driving or spending time outdoors. These details help your doctor understand the full impact of the disease and how to best manage it.Know your specialistsBefore seeking out a doctor, it’s good to know which specialists identify, diagnose and treat TED and how they work together to help you manage the disease. TEDspecialists.com can help patients find a nearby TED Specialist, and also provides helpful information about TED, including symptoms, risk factors and tips for tracking symptoms.* Endocrinologists specialize in glands and hormones to gauge thyroid activity and help patients manage Graves’ disease and other conditions related to the thyroid.* Ophthalmologists specialize in eye and vision care and can specifically diagnose TED through an eye exam. However, not all ophthalmologists specialize in TED, so it’s important to seek out an expert who frequently treats and manages TED.* Oculoplastic surgeons and neuro-ophthalmologists are specialists who typically have extensive experience managing TED. They are best equipped to conduct comprehensive TED exams and promptly treat difficult symptoms. Bringing in these specialists helps endocrinologists and ophthalmologists address immediate needs and facilitate a long-term care plan.“Every medicine has potential side effects. For TEPEZZA, people who are pregnant should not take TEPEZZA and should tell their doctor if they are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Patients with diabetes or pre-existing irritable bowel disease should inform their doctor before taking TEPEZZA. Also, as with most medicines that are infused, infusion reactions can occur,” added Happ.For adult patients who think they may have TED, speak with your doctor and visit TEPEZZA.com for more safety information.USE and IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONWhat is the most important information I should know about TEPEZZA?Infusion reactions can happen during or within 24 hours after your infusion of TEPEZZA. If you have a reaction while receiving TEPEZZA, your doctor or nurse will slow or stop your infusion and treat your reaction. If you have a severe infusion reaction, your doctor may stop your treatment completely.Tell your doctor or nurse right away if you have any of these symptoms during or after your treatment with TEPEZZA:High blood pressureFast heartbeatRedness of the face/Feeling hotDifficulty breathingHeadacheMuscle painIf you have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis, TEPEZZA may make your IBD symptoms worse. Symptoms of worsening IBD may include: an increased number of loose stools with stomach pain or cramps, and blood in your stools. After each TEPEZZA infusion, tell your doctor right away if you have worsening IBD symptoms.TEPEZZA may cause an increase in your blood sugar. Before starting treatment with TEPEZZA, tell your doctor if you are currently being treated for diabetes, know your blood sugar is high, or have been diagnosed with diabetes. It is important for you to take your treatments and follow an appropriate diet for glucose control as prescribed by your doctor.Before receiving TEPEZZA, tell your doctor if you:Have inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis).Are currently being treated for diabetes, have been diagnosed with diabetes, or know your blood sugar is high.Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. TEPEZZA may harm your unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you become pregnant or suspect you are pregnant during treatment with TEPEZZA.Women who are able to become pregnant should use an effective form of birth control (contraception) prior to starting treatment, during treatment and for at least 6 months after the final dose of TEPEZZA.Are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if TEPEZZA passes into your breast milk. Talk to your doctor about the best ways to feed your baby during treatment with TEPEZZA.Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over the counter medicines, vitamins, dietary and herbal supplements. Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show your doctor and pharmacist when you get a new medicine.What are the possible side effects of TEPEZZA?The most common side effects of TEPEZZA include muscle cramps or spasms, nausea, hair loss, diarrhea, feeling tired, high blood sugar, hearing problems, taste changes, headache, and dry skin.This is not a complete list of all possible side effects. Tell your doctor or treatment team if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away.Please visit TEPEZZA.com for more information.You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.Visit www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch, or call the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.USETEPEZZA is a prescription medicine used to treat Thyroid Eye Disease."

Other major risk factors include:4In some cases, people with small cell lung cancer may not show symptoms.Because people with SCLC may not always show symptoms, it’s especially important for people with exposure to risk factors to be especially vigilant.In later stages, small cell lung cancer symptoms include:5It’s important for people to contact their doctor when they first recognize symptoms, as treatment is more likely to be effective when lung cancer is diagnosed at an earlier stage.Stigma is one of the main barriers for people with SCLC from receiving the medical care they need.Since the 1950s, attitudes around lung cancer have played a role in shaping perceptions of people with the disease. Due to an association with smoking, people with lung cancer often face stigma from both the general public and healthcare providers, which can impact ability to seek treatment.6In 2019, the national average of those who did not receive treatment for lung cancer was 15.2%.7“During my time as an oncologist, I’ve treated many people with lung cancer who have delayed seeing a doctor due to feelings of shame and guilt associated with the disease. It’s so important that we overcome this stigma that prevents people with lung cancer from receiving appropriate treatment and medical care,” commented Dr. Joan Schiller, a professor in the Department of Medicine at the Inova Schar Cancer Institute.The first FDA-approved treatment for 1L ES-SCLC in 20 years:For years, the standard treatment for people with SCLC has been chemotherapy, but last year the FDA approved a new type of treatment for the disease called immunotherapy, which works with a person’s immune system to identify and attack cancer cells. Immunotherapy may also affect normal cells.Tecentriq, in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin and etoposide), is the first FDA-approved immunotherapy medicine for the initial treatment of ES-SCLC. In the clinical trial, Tecentriq has been shown to improve outcomes for people with this form of lung cancer.8Dr. Balazs Halmos, Director, Thoracic Oncology and Clinical Cancer Genomics at Montefiore Albert Einstein Cancer Center noted, “The approval of Tecentriq marked exciting progress for people with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer, offering the first approved treatment in decades that may help them live longer.”1.

            "body": "Most women learn how to manage their periods beginning in their teenage years, often juggling work and school with an extra tampon or two on hand. However, for many women, managing a period often becomes a major burden due to symptoms stemming from uterine fibroids as they get into their 20s and 30s.1,2 Uterine fibroids, also known as leiomyomas, are the most common type of non-cancerous pelvic tumors in women affecting up to 80 percent of African American women and 70 percent of Caucasian women that can develop before the age of 50.3-6For some, uterine fibroids can be completely asymptomatic, but approximately six million women in the U.S. are estimated to be suffering from symptoms due to uterine fibroids.1,7,8,9 The most common uterine fibroid symptom is excessive menstrual bleeding.4,5 Women who experience heavy menstrual bleeding commonly have to change their pads or tampons frequently and may experience blood loss that is two to three times greater, or more, than what is considered normal.3,10,11 Heavy bleeding is also the main reason women seek treatment, with 65 percent of patients with fibroids symptoms reporting they worry about bleeding accidents through their clothes or bedding.12Each woman’s experience is unique, but the symptoms can interfere with her daily activities, relationships with family, friends and loved ones, and the ability to work.12 “I lived in constant fear of leakage,” said Julie B., a woman living with uterine fibroids. “I carried a towel with me and tried to plan trips around my heavy periods. I purchased several pairs of black pants, just in case.”Traditionally, uterine fibroids are commonly managed through surgery and are one of the leading causes for hysterectomies in the U.S.3,6,13 However, women with heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids now have a non-surgical option to consider. Earlier this year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Oriahnn™ (elagolix, estradiol, and norethindrone acetate capsules; elagolix capsules). Oriahnn is the first and only FDA-approved oral medication specifically designed to treat heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids.Oriahnn was studied in two six-month clinical trials, including premenopausal women with heavy periods due to uterine fibroids aged 25-53. In clinical trials, Oriahnn was clinically proven to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding in women with uterine fibroids in the first month of use by at least 50 percent (six percent in placebo). By the third month of therapy, Oriahnn was able to reduce heavy bleeding due to uterine fibroids by more than 85 percent (10 percent in placebo). Ultimately, Oriahnn was proven to lighten heavy periods in about seven in ten women, compared to about one in ten women that took placebo. This finding was based on the number of women that saw both a bleeding volume reduction of 50 percent or more from the start of the clinical trial, and had an amount of 80 mL (about a third of one cup) or less by the final month of treatment. The most common adverse reactions (&gt;5%) in clinical trials were hot flushes, headache, fatigue, and metrorrhagia.14,15Please click to see the full prescribing information including medication guide.For women exploring treatment who don’t want to undergo surgery, Oriahnn may be an option. “My doctor had recommended a hysterectomy because my periods were horrific, but that’s just not in my plans right now,” Julie B. said. “I’m glad there is a non-surgical option available.”Women who have heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids and want to learn more about a non-surgical treatment option, can visit Oriahnn.com and talk to an OB/GYN to see if Oriahnn may be right for them.USEORIAHNN™ (elagolix, estradiol, and norethindrone acetate capsules; elagolix capsules) is a prescription medicine used to control heavy menstrual bleeding related to uterine fibroids in women before menopause.

            "body": "Your skin is the largest organ of your body. And, like other parts of the body, it can get cancer. Melanoma is a rare form of skin cancer, and if caught early is often treatable. When it spreads to other parts of the body, the cancer is advanced – stage III or IV. Advanced stages of melanoma are harder to treat.Cancers like melanoma can be caused by mutations, or changes, in the DNA of skin cells. In melanoma, these mutations can happen randomly or through ongoing exposure to the sun and UV rays. When this type of damage happens, it can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and may cause cancer cells to spread. One of the most common changes in melanoma cells that increase tumor cell growth is a BRAF mutation. Approximately one in two people diagnosed with melanoma have a BRAF mutation in their tumor cells.Researchers are working to better understand the role of mutations like BRAF in melanoma. When people with melanoma participate in research and clinical trials, it helps to advance the science. Scientific advancements have led to more treatment options for people living with stage III and IV melanoma.Read the Q&amp;A below to learn more about this type of melanoma and important information to consider when you discuss with your doctor, including safety and potential long-term benefits shown in a clinical trial of a targeted therapy to treat stage III melanoma after surgery.Q: How many people get melanoma and what role do gene alterations play in melanoma?A: Approximately 100,000 adults in the United States will be diagnosed with melanoma in 2020 and approximately 6,850 people will die from the disease. Melanoma is a complex disease; changes or alterations to the genes play a role in its progression. Approximately one in two people diagnosed with melanoma have a BRAF mutation in their tumors, which is a specific change in the BRAF gene that may lead to the growth and spread of cancer cells. Biomarker testing can determine whether a tumor has a BRAF mutation.Q: Why is biomarker testing and knowing your BRAF status so important for melanoma? A: One of the most important things people diagnosed with melanoma can do is speak to their doctor about getting a biomarker test. The biomarker test helps people learn their BRAF mutation status. When the doctor and the patient know the BRAF mutation status, it helps identify all possible treatment options and may help make an informed treatment plan. People with a BRAF mutation may be candidates for therapies that target the mutation.For example, one Phase III study that included patients with BRAF+, stage III melanoma showed the benefits of taking Tafinlar® (dabrafenib) plus Mekinist® (trametinib) for one year after having surgery to remove melanoma. At first analysis of this data, the results showed that the combination of Tafinlar plus Mekinist reduced the risk of relapse or death by 53% compared to placebo.Later on, during an updated analysis, at five years, an estimated 52% of patients treated with Tafinlar plus Mekinist were alive without their cancer coming back compared to 36% of those who were treated with two placebo (pills with no active medication). During this update, it showed that there was a 49% reduction in risk of relapse or death.Q: What do clinical experts say about a treatment for BRAF-mutated melanoma following surgery?A: Researchers recently announced results from the COMBI-AD study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in September 2020. The 5-year results showed treatment with Tafinlar® (dabrafenib) plus Mekinist® (trametinib) for one year after surgery for BRAF+ stage III melanoma may result in relapse-free survival for some patients. An estimated 52% of patients treated with Tafinlar plus Mekinist were alive without their cancer coming back compared to 36% of those who were treated with two placebo (pills with no active medication). Information about side effects, some of which can be severe, for Tafinlar plus Mekinist are included at the end of this article.Q: What does the COMBI-AD study mean for patients with stage III melanoma?A: Some patients who have their melanoma removed by surgery still face the potential risk of their cancer coming back. Patients who have BRAF-positive stage III melanoma may be at a higher risk of their cancer coming back.The findings from COMBI-AD support the important role a targeted therapy like Tafinlar plus Mekinist may play after surgery.Q: What should people know about the safety results of the COMBI-AD study?A: The COMBI-AD study helped researchers and physicians understand the side effects seen with treatment with Tafinlar plus Mekinist. Tafinlar plus Mekinist, in combination, may cause serious side effects. As part of informed treatment decision-making, patients and their physicians should review and discuss medication risks and benefits.Some of the side effects can be severe and lead to death. Some of the side effects can cause patients to pause or completely stop taking their treatment. Patients should immediately talk to their doctor or healthcare provider if they experience any side effect.

            "body": "Tammy, a mother and grandmother, who always led an active lifestyle — going to the gym several times a week — never thought she would be at risk for heart failure.Tammy began experiencing what she thought were common cold symptoms, including a persistent cough, shortness of breath and fatigue, but they worsened over time. “I went from leading group exercise classes, to being completely exhausted just from walking to my car from my door,” Tammy recalls.When Tammy woke up one morning, she noticed that her abdomen was bloated and she had rapidly gained weight, a sign of fluid retention (edema). She knew something wasn’t right, so she scheduled an appointment with her doctor and was eventually referred to a cardiologist.To Tammy’s surprise she was diagnosed with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), a chronic, progressive condition that changes the structure of the heart so it can’t work as well. This specific type of heart failure accounts for half of all heart failure cases. Tammy’s condition got so serious that she was hospitalized.There are approximately 1 million hospitalizations for heart failure every year in the US — that’s about 2 every minute. A hospitalization for heart failure is a sign that the condition is worsening, and patients may experience frequent hospitalizations throughout their condition, which can take a great toll on them and their loved ones as well as the health care system.Tammy has worked closely with her health care providers to develop a heart failure treatment plan that works best for her, including ENTRESTO® (sacubitril/valsartan), a heart failure medication prescribed by most cardiologists that helps improve the heart’s ability to pump blood to the body.While everyone’s journey may be different, Tammy hasn’t been hospitalized since starting ENTRESTO. In addition, Entresto helped Tammy's heart so she can keep on doing what she loves.In addition to frequent hospitalizations, heart failure can make doing daily activities harder, such as walking to the mailbox or taking care of household chores. Some symptoms of heart failure are shortness of breath, persistent cough, fatigue and swelling in legs, feet, ankles and/or abdomen. While it’s always been important, now more than ever, it is critical for patients to actively communicate how they are feeling to their health care providers so they can be partners in care.Though not as active as she once was, Tammy has adapted to a new routine, including eating a low-salt diet, getting some regular physical activity, and taking her medications, including ENTRESTO. These unprecedented times can be challenging, especially for those with heart failure, but Tammy takes precautions to stay well and tries to stick to her heart-healthy routine. Instead of going to the gym, she walks her dogs outside and uses workout videos, and she cooks meals at home as much as possible.Tammy encourages others with the condition to keep positive, set daily goals — no matter how small — and stay connected with their health care providers to find a treatment plan that works for them.To learn more about ENTRESTO for heart failure patients, go to ENTRESTO.com.ENTRESTO (sacubitril/valsartan) is a prescription medicine used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization in adults with long-lasting (chronic) heart failure. ENTRESTO is usually used with other heart failure therapies, in place of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or other angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) therapy. Heart failure occurs when the heart is weak and cannot pump enough blood to your lungs and the rest of your body. It is not known if ENTRESTO is safe and effective in children less than 1 year old.Entresto can harm or cause death to an unborn baby. Patients should talk to their doctor about other ways to treat heart failure if they plan to become pregnant. If a patient gets pregnant while taking Entresto, she should tell her doctor right away.Patients are not to take Entresto if they are allergic to sacubitril or valsartan or any of the ingredients in Entresto; have had an allergic reaction including swelling of the face, lips, tongue, throat or trouble breathing while taking a type of medicine called an ACE inhibitor or ARB; or take an ACE inhibitor medicine. Patients are not to take Entresto for at least 36 hours before or after they take an ACE inhibitor medicine. Patients should talk with their doctor or pharmacist before taking Entresto if they are not sure if they take an ACE inhibitor medicine. Patients are not to take Entresto if they have diabetes and take a medicine that contains aliskiren.Before they take Entresto, patients should tell their doctor about all of their medical conditions, including if they have kidney or liver problems; or a history of hereditary angioedema; are pregnant or plan to become pregnant; are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Patients should either take Entresto or breastfeed. They should not do both.Patients should tell their doctor about all the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. They should especially tell their doctor if they take potassium supplements or a salt substitute; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); lithium; or other medicines for high blood pressure or heart problems such as an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or aliskiren.Entresto may cause serious side effects including serious allergic reactions causing swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat (angioedema) that may cause trouble breathing and death. Patients are to get emergency medical help right away if they have symptoms of angioedema or trouble breathing. Patients are not to take Entresto again if they have had angioedema while taking Entresto. People who are black or who have had angioedema may have a higher risk of having angioedema if they take Entresto. Entresto may cause low blood pressure (hypotension). Patients are to call their doctor if they become dizzy or lightheaded, or they develop extreme fatigue. Entresto may cause kidney problems or an increased amount of potassium in the blood.The most common side effects in adults were low blood pressure, high potassium, cough, dizziness, and kidney problems.Please see full Prescribing Information, including Boxed WARNING available at http://www.pharma.us.novartis.com/product/pi/pdf/entresto.pdfPatients are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.

A hospitalization for heart failure is a sign that the condition is worsening, and patients may experience frequent hospitalizations throughout their condition, which can take a great toll on them and their loved ones as well as the health care system.</p><p>Tammy has worked closely with her health care providers to develop a heart failure treatment plan that works best for her, including <a href=\"https://www.entresto.com/info/how-entresto-works.jsp?site=TP2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ENTRESTO<sup>®</sup></a> (sacubitril/valsartan), a heart failure medication prescribed by most cardiologists that helps improve the heart’s ability to pump blood to the body.</p><p>While everyone’s journey may be different, Tammy hasn’t been hospitalized since starting ENTRESTO. In addition, Entresto helped Tammy's heart so she can keep on doing what she loves.</p><p>In addition to frequent hospitalizations, heart failure can make doing daily activities harder, such as walking to the mailbox or taking care of household chores. Some symptoms of heart failure are shortness of breath, persistent cough, fatigue and swelling in legs, feet, ankles and/or abdomen. While it’s always been important, now more than ever, it is critical for patients to <a href=\"https://www.entresto.com/info/doctor-discussion-guide.jsp?site=TP3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">actively communicate</a> how they are feeling to their health care providers so they can be partners in care.</p><p>Though not as active as she once was, Tammy has adapted to a new routine, including eating a low-salt diet, getting some regular physical activity, and taking her medications, including ENTRESTO. These unprecedented times can be challenging, especially for those with heart failure, but Tammy takes precautions to stay well and tries to stick to her heart-healthy routine. Instead of going to the gym, she walks her dogs outside and uses workout videos, and she cooks meals at home as much as possible.</p><p>Tammy encourages others with the condition to keep positive, set daily goals — no matter how small — and stay connected with their health care providers to find a treatment plan that works for them.</p><p>To learn more about ENTRESTO for heart failure patients, go to <a href=\"https://central.entresto.com/entrestosignup/support.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ENTRESTO.com</a>.</p><p>ENTRESTO (sacubitril/valsartan) is a prescription medicine used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization in adults with long-lasting (chronic) heart failure. ENTRESTO is usually used with other heart failure therapies, in place of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or other angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) therapy. Heart failure occurs when the heart is weak and cannot pump enough blood to your lungs and the rest of your body. It is not known if ENTRESTO is safe and effective in children less than 1 year old.</p><p>Entresto can harm or cause death to an unborn baby. Patients should talk to their doctor about other ways to treat heart failure if they plan to become pregnant. If a patient gets pregnant while taking Entresto, she should tell her doctor right away.</p><p>Patients are not to take Entresto if they are allergic to sacubitril or valsartan or any of the ingredients in Entresto; have had an allergic reaction including swelling of the face, lips, tongue, throat or trouble breathing while taking a type of medicine called an ACE inhibitor or ARB; or take an ACE inhibitor medicine. Patients are not to take Entresto for at least 36 hours before or after they take an ACE inhibitor medicine. Patients should talk with their doctor or pharmacist before taking Entresto if they are not sure if they take an ACE inhibitor medicine. Patients are not to take Entresto if they have diabetes and take a medicine that contains aliskiren.</p><p>Before they take Entresto, patients should tell their doctor about all of their medical conditions, including if they have kidney or liver problems; or a history of hereditary angioedema; are pregnant or plan to become pregnant; are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Patients should either take Entresto or breastfeed. They should not do both.</p><p>Patients should tell their doctor about all the medicines they take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. They should especially tell their doctor if they take potassium supplements or a salt substitute; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); lithium; or other medicines for high blood pressure or heart problems such as an ACE inhibitor, ARB, or aliskiren.</p><p>Entresto may cause serious side effects including serious allergic reactions causing swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat (angioedema) that may cause trouble breathing and death. Patients are to get emergency medical help right away if they have symptoms of angioedema or trouble breathing. Patients are not to take Entresto again if they have had angioedema while taking Entresto. People who are black or who have had angioedema may have a higher risk of having angioedema if they take Entresto. Entresto may cause low blood pressure (hypotension). Patients are to call their doctor if they become dizzy or lightheaded, or they develop extreme fatigue. Entresto may cause kidney problems or an increased amount of potassium in the blood.</p><p>The most common side effects in adults were low blood pressure, high potassium, cough, dizziness, and <br>kidney problems.</p><p><strong>Please see full Prescribing Information, including Boxed WARNING available at </strong><a href=\"http://www.pharma.us.novartis.com/product/pi/pdf/entresto.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://www.pharma.us.novartis.com/product/pi/pdf/entresto.pdf</a></p><p>Patients are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.

            "body": "Tiffany Williams went to the doctor to see if something could be done about her severe back pain, but the root cause was something she wasn't planning on. She learned she had multiple myeloma. As the doctor explained this rare form of blood cancer and how it would impact her life, her brain latched on to a single phrase: “Incurable but treatable.”As the news settled in over the following days and weeks, she held on to that fearful term, “incurable.”She says, “I was shocked and surprised to learn that while multiple myeloma is considered a rare disease, it is the most common form of blood cancer among African Americans.”Learning more about her diagnosisPrior to being diagnosed with multiple myeloma, Tiffany had always been in great health, with a vibrant personality. Though her career was in healthcare, her work never focused on cancer treatment, or even caring for patients with a cancer diagnosis. Despite her background, she found she knew little of what to expect once she learned she had multiple myeloma.Navigating a new normalThe most challenging part of living with multiple myeloma, Tiffany says, is the physical challenges. Some weeks she found herself too sick to get out of bed for two- or three-day stretches. Feeling the changes taking place in her body was most difficult to accept.For an idea of what was happening to Tiffany, here’s a look at some characteristics of multiple myeloma, which is the second most common form of blood cancer in the U.S.Multiple myeloma affects plasma cells, a type of white blood cell in the bone marrow that helps the body fight infection. The myeloma cells rapidly produce abnormal antibodies called M proteins, which crowd out other important blood cells. A high level of these M proteins is a hallmark characteristic of multiple myeloma.Patients with multiple myeloma may or may not experience symptoms. The common symptoms patients present with include the body’s calcium levels spiking, which can lead to kidney issues, anemia as well as bone pain.The disease is most often diagnosed in patients between the ages of 65-74. It’s more common in males and twice as common in African Americans than white Americans, for reasons that are not clearly understood. While many African American patients have a lower-risk genetic profile and could achieve treatment results equal to those seen in other multiple myeloma patient populations, barriers to appropriate treatment and lack of awareness of the disease contribute to inconsistent treatment approaches.In 2020, there were an estimated 32,270 new cases in the U.S, and an estimated 275,000 new cases will develop worldwide by 2040.The current COVID-19 pandemic adds another challenge for multiple myeloma patients. Because multiple myeloma affects infection-fighting plasma cells, it impacts the immune system’s ability to root out infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Therefore, patients with multiple myeloma and other blood cancers are particularly vulnerable to the virus. Research indicates that patients whose cancer progressed during a COVID-19 diagnosis had an increased risk of death. Additionally, routine doctor visits that could potentially lead to an earlier cancer diagnosis have been delayed or avoided because of the pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports 4 in 10 U.S. adults have avoided medical care because of concerns related to COVID-19.Getting treatment: An ongoing processTiffany worked closely with her care team to help her evaluate her treatment options and make the best-informed decisions. She recalls how she felt as she anticipated the first part of her treatment plan – an autologous stem cell transplant – which is a standard of care in multiple myeloma that uses healthy stem cells from one’s own body.“I was really anxious about starting treatment,” she says. “Very nervous. I remember being nauseous on the way to treatment. But once we got through the first day, my anxiety was relieved.”As a maintenance therapy following her stem cell transplant, she now takes Revlimid® (lenalidomide), a prescription medicine that’s used to treat adults with multiple myeloma following an autologous stem cell transplant.REVLIMID® (lenalidomide) is a prescription medicine, used to treat adults with multiple myeloma (MM) in combination with the medicine dexamethasone, or as maintenance treatment after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (a type of stem cell transplant that uses your own stem cells). REVLIMID should not be used to treat people who have chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) unless they are participants in a controlled clinical trial. It is not known if REVLIMID is safe and effective in children.WARNING: Risk to unborn babies, risk of low blood counts and blood clots.Before you begin taking REVLIMID, you must read and agree to all of the instructions in the REVLIMID REMS® program. Before prescribing REVLIMID, your healthcare provider will explain the REVLIMID REMS program to you and have you sign the Patient-Physician Agreement Form.Please see additional Important Safety Information below, and full Prescribing Information, including Boxed WARNINGS and Medication Guide, on REVLIMID.comTiffany explains that after the stem cell transplant, there would be residual disease that remains in the blood.“Revlimid has been my maintenance therapy to prolong the response (of the stem cell transplant),” she says.This is the story of a patient’s experience with Revlimid® (lenalidomide). Not all patient experiences will be the same.How Revlimid works and what to expectRevlimid is a prescription medicine, used to treat adults with multiple myeloma. It is used in several FDA-approved therapy combinations, or as a maintenance therapy after an autologous stem cell transplant to help sustain the response or delay disease progression. Revlimid is not a traditional chemotherapy, injection or infusion. It is a once-daily capsule taken at home or wherever is convenient.Most common side effects include: diarrhea, itching and rash, nausea, constipation, tiredness or weakness, fever, itching, swelling of your arms, hands, legs, feet, and skin, sleep problems (insomnia), headache, muscle cramps or spasms, shortness of breath, cough, sore throat, and other symptoms of the common cold, upper respiratory tract infection or bronchitis, inflammation of the stomach and intestine (“stomach flu”), nose bleed, shaking or trembling (tremor), joint aches, and pain in your back or stomach area (abdomen).Patients experiencing side effects should report them to their doctor.Please see more information below; these are not all possible side effects. Talk to your healthcare provider for more information. Always talk to your doctor if you have side effects.Maintaining her treatment along with her spiritsLiving with multiple myeloma has been challenging for Tiffany. Fortunately, her family is her support system that keeps her motivated and helps her stay optimistic.Her husband, Adrian, has been her rock, she says. It was he who helped her shift her focus from “incurable” to “treatable.”Tiffany has also found it empowering to give voice to the struggles of multiple myeloma and being an advocate for others who share her diagnosis.“I think the most important tip that I can give other patients is the importance of maintaining an open line of communication with their care team. Keeping regular communication with my doctor has made it easy for him to adjust my dosage as needed to remain on therapy, which is very important to me.”Individual results can vary.What is REVLIMID® (lenalidomide)?REVLIMID® (lenalidomide) is a prescription medicine, used to treat adults with multiple myeloma (MM) in combination with the medicine dexamethasone, or as maintenance treatment after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (a type of stem cell transplant that uses your own stem cells).

However, Alek’s diagnosis with a rare, genetic disease called spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) changed everything. The family’s days were soon filled with doctor’s appointments and navigating clinical trials.Their journey started when Alek was seven months old and began to fall behind on physical milestones. Doctors first told Iwona and Todd that Alek had hypotonia, sometimes called “floppy infant syndrome,” and incorrectly diagnosed him with cerebral palsy. When Alek lost the ability to hold up his head and began having trouble swallowing, Todd and Iwona became concerned and sought a second opinion. “We didn’t understand what was going on but it was evident something was wrong,” Iwona said. “Alek was changing from a healthy baby to a weaker baby right before our eyes.”The path to a diagnosisAfter consulting with a neurologist, they learned that Alek had SMA — a severe, progressive neuromuscular disease that can be fatal. It affects approximately one in 10,000 babies and is the leading genetic cause of infant mortality.SMA leads to muscle weakness that can impact a person’s ability to walk, eat and even breathe on their own. Depending on the severity of SMA, some people require constant caregiver support for daily activities, such as going to the bathroom, getting dressed and brushing their teeth. There are four primary types of SMA, determined by the age when symptoms begin and physical milestones reached. Alek has Type 2 SMA, which is usually diagnosed between six months to two years of age. People with Type 2 SMA may experience respiratory issues and be unable to walk.A parent’s love does not quitDoctors told Todd and Iwona that the months of incorrect diagnoses had caused Alek’s strength and motor function to decline and that there was nothing that could be done.Not taking no for an answer, the family turned to the SMA community and Alek’s neurologist for help. They learned about a study for an investigational treatment that could be administered orally and at-home. This treatment seemed like a good option for Alek and they worked with their neurologist to enroll in the clinical trial.Starting a new journey Shortly after, Alek received his first dose of this medicine, now approved as Evrysdi™ (risdiplam) for the treatment of SMA in adults and children 2 months of age and older.Todd and Iwona have noticed improvements in Alek’s motor function since he started treatment, and they are thankful that in the midst of a global health pandemic, Alek has an oral medicine that can be taken at home.'The neurologist told us that Alek is improving on his physical assessments, which are based on measurements of motor function,” said Todd. In one of the clinical trials for Evrysdi, motor function improved in children and adults with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA after taking Evrysdi for 12 months (average 1.36-point increase on the Motor Function Measure [MFM-32] scale compared with an average 0.19-decrease for those not taking Evrysdi).*A family’s hope for the future More than two years since Alek’s diagnosis, his family is learning how to adapt to life with SMA. For example, the family is building specialized features in their house to make daily living and moving around in a wheelchair more manageable for Alek.With more knowledge and experience, the family is optimistic as they look to the future. “When it is once again safe to travel, we plan to visit Poland and Iwona’s parents,” says Todd. “This is something we’ve been planning for a long time.”*SUNFISH is a 2-part study of children and adults with later-onset SMA. This includes 128 people with Type 2 SMA and 52 with Type 3 SMA. Part 2 includes 180 people and is measuring the safety and effectiveness of Evrysdi at the recommended dose (n=120), compared with those not taking Evrysdi (n=60). The main measurement was the change in motor function, as assessed on Motor Function Measure-32 (MFM-32), after 12 months of treatment, compared with those not taking Evrysdi.What is Evrysdi?Evrysdi is a prescription medicine used to treat spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in adults and children 2 months of age and older.It is not known if Evrysdi is safe and effective in children under 2 months of age.Important Safety InformationThese are not all of the possible side effects of Evrysdi.

            "body": "Living with a chronic lung condition can be challenging. The first step toward improving your lung health is understanding what kind of lung condition you have and what you can do to manage your condition in close partnership with your doctor.One such condition, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) lung disease, can be serious and can worsen over time. Commonly found in the environment, MAC bacteria is the most common species that causes nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung disease. MAC bacteria can get inside your lungs when you breathe them in through daily activities, such as showering or gardening. While most people who come in contact with MAC do not develop an infection, people at risk are those with other lung conditions such as bronchiectasis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma.MAC lung disease symptoms – persistent cough, shortness of breath and fatigue – are similar to those of other lung conditions. Thus, it may take years to identify and properly diagnose. Early identification is important because MAC lung disease can progress and could potentially result in lung damage.If your doctor suspects you have MAC lung disease, you may be referred to a specialist – such as a pulmonologist or infectious disease specialist – who has experience diagnosing and treating the condition. A series of tests can help ensure a proper diagnosis, and these include obtaining sputum, or mucus samples, and a chest CT scan. If diagnosed, you and your doctor will work together to determine the right treatment plan for you.Dr. Nicole Lapinel, pulmonologist and assistant clinical professor at Louisiana State University School of Medicine, says that active monitoring and being open with your healthcare team about how you’re feeling are an integral part of MAC lung disease management.According to Dr. Lapinel, “While the 2020 NTM Lung Disease Treatment Guidelines are at the forefront of doctors’ decision-making process, it’s essential for patients to have a personalized treatment plan that includes support from other specialists. The first steps are to work together to determine the appropriate combination of airway clearance techniques, antibiotics if recommended and lifestyle changes to manage the condition.”Monitoring ProgressAfter establishing an initial treatment plan, it’s important to continue monitoring progress to assess whether the condition is improving, staying the same or worsening. According to the 2020 NTM Treatment Guidelines, treatment is considered successful if a patient’s sputum culture shows there is no sign of MAC, meaning they test negative for the bacteria. However, the Guidelines also suggest that if the multi-drug antibiotic treatment regimen is not successful after six months, other options may be considered. This makes it important to maintain regular communication with your care team and share how you’re feeling with your doctor.When starting new medications, Dr. Lapinel suggests keeping a journal to document symptoms and any side effects. She also encourages patients to speak with their doctors about how frequently they should be seen in the clinic; typically, once every 1-3 months depending on the circumstances.Continuing to Advocate While on TreatmentBecause managing MAC lung disease can feel overwhelming, Dr. Lapinel recommends being proactive by staying in close communication with your care team about your symptoms and overall health, even while on treatment.For MAC lung disease patients, putting this into practice is key. Kathy, a MAC lung disease patient, has learned the importance of two-way dialogue with her doctor since being diagnosed in 2015 after experiencing symptoms for five years.Kathy and her pulmonologist worked together to determine the right treatment for her, which included multiple antibiotics. Just as Dr. Lapinel recommends, Kathy scheduled routine check-ups with her own pulmonologist every few months to monitor her condition. Her pulmonologist ordered annual chest x-rays and chest CT scans in order to monitor her condition and to determine if she was making appropriate progress on treatment.After over six months of being on treatment, Kathy’s sputum cultures were still testing positive for MAC lung disease. That’s when her pulmonologist decided to refer her to an infectious disease specialist, who suggested adding prescription ARIKAYCE® (amikacin liposome inhalation suspension) to her treatment regimen. Kathy took ARIKAYCE as prescribed, to help with proper management of the condition.ARIKAYCE is the first and only FDA-approved treatment designed specifically to treat refractory MAC lung disease as part of a combination treatment plan in adult patients who did not respond to combination treatment alone.This product was approved by the FDA using the Limited Population pathway. This means the FDA has approved this drug for a limited and specific patient population, and studies on the drug may have only answered focused questions about its safety and effectiveness. ARIKAYCE is an inhaled antibiotic you take with a nebulizer. It is different from other inhaled antibiotics because the amikacin is contained inside tiny particles called liposomes. When you inhale ARIKAYCE, the liposomes containing the medicine travel into your lungs. Once inside the lungs, they release the medicine to fight the infection.As patients consider their own treatment journeys with their doctors, Dr. Lapinel offers the following tips to help patients manage this condition.1. Maintain Open Communication with Your Healthcare TeamArrange regular check-ins with your doctors to monitor your progress and determine if your treatment is working. Today, healthcare services can be conducted virtually through the internet and telephone, but certain appointments may still need to occur in person. You should talk to your doctors to determine your options.2. Stay on Top of Your Overall Health It is important to take care of your overall health – mentally, emotionally and physically. Your doctor can share lifestyle changes such as a well-balanced diet, ways to help reduce exposure to MAC bacteria and airway clearance techniques. Beyond your care team, you may benefit from a support system to help manage your condition. This may include family members, friends or loved ones that may help with emotional support and activities such as transportation to and from appointments.3. Know Your Treatment OptionsIf you continue to test positive for MAC lung disease after months of treatment, consider speaking with your doctor about alternate treatment options that may be appropriate. The 2020 NTM Treatment Guidelines recommend adding ARIKAYCE for MAC lung disease patients who continue to test positive after at least six months of a standard multidrug treatment regimen. Learn more about the guidelines and speak to your doctor to find out if these could impact your treatment plan.If you have been prescribed ARIKAYCE, you can consider enrolling in the Arikares Patient Support Program. This program is designed to help you get started on treatment and become familiar with taking it. Additionally, the Arikares Patient Support Program provides information about insurance coverage and financial support options for eligible patients.Knowing the Possible Side EffectsEveryone responds differently to treatment, so if you think you may be experiencing any potential side effects while taking ARIKAYCE, be sure to alert your doctor immediately.ARIKAYCE can cause serious side effects, including:While using ARIKAYCE, these side effects may become serious enough that treatment in a hospital is needed. Call your healthcare provider or get medical help right away if you have any of these serious side effects while taking ARIKAYCE. Your healthcare provider may ask you to stop using ARIKAYCE for a short period of time or completely stop using ARIKAYCE.Do not use ARIKAYCE if you are allergic to any aminoglycoside, or any of the ingredients in ARIKAYCE.Before using ARIKAYCE, tell your healthcare provider about all medical conditions, including if you:Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription medicines and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.ARIKAYCE may cause serious side effects, including:The most common side effects of ARIKAYCE include: changes in voice and hoarseness (dysphonia), sore throat, diarrhea, muscle pain, nausea, tiredness (fatigue), fever, vomiting, headache, decreased weight, increased sputum, rash, chest discomfort, or cough during or after a dose of ARIKAYCE, especially in the first month after starting treatment.These are not all of the possible side effects of ARIKAYCE. Call your doctor or pharmacist for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.Please see full Prescribing Information at ARIKAYCE.com.For important questions to ask your doctor about ARIKAYCE, and tips on how to make the most of your next appointment, see here for a discussion guide.

            "word_count": "707",
            "summary": "",
            "body": "The pandemic changed our travel habits considerably, and forced us to reconsider how we get around safely. For example, the latest Hankook Tire Gauge Index found that three-quarters of Americans don’t feel comfortable taking public transportation because of the coronavirus pandemic, leading more people to get behind the wheel.This increase in drivers is having an impact on our car buying decisions: Data showed that 44% of Americans have already considered a new vehicle purchase. Many are likely to be first-time car buyers, too, as over half of Gen Z and millennials are thinking about a new vehicle purchase.In addition to the usual considerations when buying a vehicle — cost, performance, safety and reliability — the events of 2020 have raised new questions. After a year of significant change, here are four things to consider when buying a new vehicle.Your vehicle is just as much about comfort as it is mobility We’re spending more time in our cars, even when we’re not going places — waiting in parking lots for grocery orders, lining up at drive-thrus, or even taking a conference call when home gets a little too noisy! So a vehicle’s interior should be a nice place to spend your time.The good news is that there are plenty of standard features and affordable options to make that possible. The Gauge Index found that Americans consider everything from Bluetooth connectivity (62%) and in-dash navigation (57%), to remote and keyless start tech (56%) as important factors when choosing their vehicles.Self-healing tire technology was also rated as an important feature by 56% of Americans — a useful feature at any time, and crucial when one may not want to come into close contact with others for an emergency tire change!Is it finally time to plug in?With increased range, lower prices and expansions in charging infrastructure, electric vehicles (EVs) are increasingly becoming a choice for drivers, with 62% of Americans likely to consider an EV.Deciding if it’s time to go electric means considering a few important factors. The first is range: What do you anticipate to be your regular mileage between charges? The average range of today’s electric vehicles should be more than enough for daily commuting, errands and even the occasional afternoon road trip.Then, make sure you have access to charging infrastructure at home and at your frequent destinations. And calculate the true financial benefit, taking into account rebates, credits and a newfound freedom from the petrol pump.Take time to kick the tires.When buying a new vehicle, check the tires it comes with to ensure they’re best suited for the weather conditions where you live.

            "html": "<p>The pandemic changed our travel habits considerably, and forced us to reconsider how we get around safely. For example, the latest <a href=\"https://www.hankooktire.com/us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hankook Tire</a> Gauge Index found that three-quarters of Americans don’t feel comfortable taking public transportation because of the coronavirus pandemic, leading more people to get behind the wheel.</p><p>This increase in drivers is having an impact on our car buying decisions: Data showed that 44% of Americans have already considered a new vehicle purchase. Many are likely to be first-time car buyers, too, as over half of Gen Z and millennials are thinking about a new vehicle purchase.</p><p>In addition to the usual considerations when buying a vehicle — cost, performance, safety and reliability — the events of 2020 have raised new questions. After a year of significant change, here are four things to consider when buying a new vehicle.</p><p><strong>Your vehicle is just as much about comfort as it is mobility </strong></p><p>We’re spending more time in our cars, even when we’re not going places — waiting in parking lots for grocery orders, lining up at drive-thrus, or even taking a conference call when home gets a little too noisy! So a vehicle’s interior should be a nice place to spend your time.</p><p>The good news is that there are plenty of standard features and affordable options to make that possible. The Gauge Index found that Americans consider everything from Bluetooth connectivity (62%) and in-dash navigation (57%), to remote and keyless start tech (56%) as important factors when choosing their vehicles.</p><p>Self-healing tire technology was also rated as an important feature by 56% of Americans — a useful feature at any time, and crucial when one may not want to come into close contact with others for an emergency tire change!</p><p><strong>Is it finally time to plug in?</strong></p><p>With increased range, lower prices and expansions in charging infrastructure, electric vehicles (EVs) are increasingly becoming a choice for drivers, with 62% of Americans likely to consider an EV.</p><p>Deciding if it’s time to go electric means considering a few important factors. The first is range: What do you anticipate to be your regular mileage between charges? The average range of today’s electric vehicles should be more than enough for daily commuting, errands and even the occasional afternoon road trip.</p><p>Then, make sure you have access to charging infrastructure at home and at your frequent destinations. And calculate the true financial benefit, taking into account rebates, credits and a newfound freedom from the petrol pump.</p><p><strong>Take time to kick the tires.</strong></p><p>When buying a new vehicle, check the tires it comes with to ensure they’re best suited for the weather conditions where you live. This is especially important when driving regularly in inclement weather where an all-weather tire like the Hankook Kinergy 4S2 can save you money down the road. Less than half (47%) of Americans can accurately identify the difference between all-weather and all-season tires, so here’s the cheat sheet: All-weather tires manage rain and snow while also delivering year-round performance; all-season tires prioritize comfort and fuel economy over ice and snow traction.</p><p>If you’re switching to electric, your tire choice could impact your ride comfort, mileage and road noise.

            "body": "Jeanneane M. was living the life of a “work hard, play hard” non-profit executive in D.C. She was enjoying her office located two buildings from the White House, the ability to travel extensively, and the opportunity to hobnob with Washington’s movers and shakers. However, the migraine headaches, which she had suffered from since age six, were increasing, leading to debilitating headaches. Ultimately, she made the difficult decision to quit the job she loved.“Something within me told me, without question, that I had to resign and move to Texas to be near my family,” Jeanneane said.With the moving van packed, Jeanneane headed off to one last doctor’s appointment before heading on the road.“Amazingly, as I handed my car keys to the valet, I suffered a seizure and went to the emergency room instead of the doctor’s appointment,” Jeanneane recalled.A subsequent MRI revealed a large lime-size tumor in her brain, which would ultimately be diagnosed as glioblastoma (GBM), a rare but aggressive form of cancer.Jeanneane described calling her mom to share the news as “the hardest thing I have ever done in my life. I knew I would break her heart.”Jeanneane’s mom, Jenny, expressed how heart wrenching it was to receive ‘The Call’ stating “Her announcement socked me in the gut.”'It's a life-changing diagnosis,” said Dr. Karen Fink, a neurooncologist at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas, who is treating Jeanneane.Dr. Fink explained to Jeanneane that treatment options for newly diagnosed GBM included surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and chemotherapy with Optune, a wearable, portable FDA-approved device.According to Fink, “Optune is non-invasive and delivers treatment directly to the tumor, and the most common device-related adverse event is mild-to-moderate skin irritation.”Optune works by delivering low-intensity, wave-like electric fields via adhesive patches called transducer arrays, placed on a patient’s scalp. These fields, known as Tumor Treating Fields or TTFields, leave patients' healthy cells mostly unaffected, but are strong enough to slow or stop cancer cells from dividing and may destroy some cancer cells completely.“Surgery rarely eliminates all tumor cells, due to the invasive nature of GBM,” Fink explained. “We aim to use all the tools at our disposal to help fight this cancer.”Jenny explained one of the reasons Jeanneane decided to use Optune was “We had read the dreadful statistics of GBM and were determined to help fight this cancer with our entirety.”Although wearing the device required Jeanneane to shave her head in order to apply the arrays, she was not too bothered.“When looking to extend your life, hair doesn’t matter,” Jeanneane said. “I wanted to do whatever I needed to.”Jeanneane, who had an active lifestyle, was, however, concerned about how using Optune would impact her ability to travel.According to Jeanneane, “The travel ended up being easier than I expected. After one successful trip, I felt like a pro and [had] no more traveling concerns.”Jeanneane has logged many miles across the country since starting Optune. She’s gone back to working nearly full-time and is a popular speaker for non-profit conferences. She also travels to visit her mom who lives in West Virginia and who helps serve as her caregiver along with her father in Texas.“My family has adjusted to stepping up to care for me,” Jeanneane said. “When my mom got ‘The Call’ at work she literally walked straight out the door and got on a plane and then spent a full year away from her home to help me fight GBM. Though I moved in with my dad in Texas I now frequently travel to visit my mom.”In fact, one aspect Jeanneane cites as the silver lining to her diagnosis is the additional time that she is now spending with her family.“I’ve learned to value the beauty in small things — seeing a niece win a medal in an ice-skating competition, watching a little nephew light up with joy upon seeing his birthday cake, giving a teen nephew advice on how to approach his first crush,” Jeanneane said. “I am grateful for being a part of these precious memories and for every day I survive, which is priceless.”Indications and Important Safety Information for Optune®What is Optune® approved to treat?Optune is a wearable, portable, FDA-approved device indicated to treat a type of brain cancer called glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in adult patients 22 years of age or older.Newly diagnosed GBMIf you have newly diagnosed GBM, Optune is used together with a chemotherapy called temozolomide (TMZ) if:Recurrent GBMIf your tumor has come back, Optune can be used alone as an alternative to standard medical therapy if:Who should not use Optune?Optune is not for everyone. Talk to your doctor if you have:Do not use Optune if you are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant. It is not known if Optune is safe or effective during pregnancy.What should I know before using Optune?Optune should only be used after receiving training from qualified personnel, such as your doctor, a nurse, or other medical staff who have completed a training course given by Novocure®, the maker of Optune.What are the possible side effects of Optune?Most common side effects of Optune when used together with chemotherapy (temozolomide, or TMZ) were low blood platelet count, nausea, constipation, vomiting, tiredness, scalp irritation from the device, headache, seizure, and depression. The most common side effects when using Optune alone were scalp irritation (redness and itchiness) and headache. Other side effects were malaise, muscle twitching, fall and skin ulcers.

Maybe you already have a health care plan but aren't sure if you're using all the benefits available to you? Exploring all coverage options can help you lower your costs.It's important to be proactive and ask questions to your health insurance provider or a licensed agent to explore opportunities to save money while staying as healthy as possible. To help guide your conversation, ask these important questions to help you maximize your health care plan benefits:What services are covered at 100% without having to meet a deductible?In addition to the monthly premium you may pay for health coverage, you often have to meet a deductible before coverage kicks in. For example, if you have a $500 deductible, you'll need to pay that much out of pocket before you are covered and your plan begins to pay its share. However, many plans have exceptions to this rule, so you should ask what is covered immediately.For example, most health plans must cover a set of preventative services at no cost to you. For example, this might cover an annual physical and wellness checkup as well as certain immunizations. Keep in mind, you will likely have to use in-network providers in order to take advantage of this no-cost coverage, so verify before making an appointment.Do I qualify for additional coverage at no cost?Your personal situation may qualify you for additional coverage, but you need to ask about your options to take advantage of these opportunities. For example, people receiving financial assistance, or on Medicaid that also qualify for Medicare benefits, may be able to enroll in a UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete® plan — a type of Dual Special Needs Plan — that offers additional benefits and features. Depending on where you live, benefits can include dental, hearing and vision coverage; and can even include credits to buy healthy food! Learn more at www.GetDual.com.With a UnitedHealthcare Dual Complete plan, you may also receive transportation to health care appointments and financial assistance to help purchase approved health items. You will also have someone to help you manage and coordinate care. All of these additional benefits may be available at no additional cost. However, according to the Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), 80% of people eligible for a Dual Special Needs Plan are not enrolled in one, so make sure to ask your health insurance provider or a licensed agent, or check the website to determine your eligibility.Are there programs I can participate in to help lower my costs? Many health plans offer additional optional programs that may help lower your premium costs and save you money. Make sure to ask about programs that may include discounts at the grocery store, rewards for hitting health goals such as taking a certain number of steps, or reimbursements for health club costs based on monthly use.It’s important to have the right kind of health coverage for your needs, and to save as much money as possible. Asking these questions will help guide your conversation with your insurance provider so that you can make the most of your coverage while saving money."

            "body": "Safety should be paramount on roads — not only for drivers, but for cyclists and pedestrians. One of the easiest ways to make sure everyone stays safe on the road is to have well-functioning headlights.Headlights define what drivers can see, and anything that limits their vision increases the risk of accidents for everyone on the road. However, one of the most common issues with headlights today is when they project uncontrolled light, also known as glare. If you’ve ever driven a car, you’ve likely been subject to this glare from oncoming traffic at one point or another — it’s blinding, it’s a safety hazard and it’s often because of illegal LED low-beam replacement bulbs.How bad is this glare, really? Think of moments when you’ve driven past cars that kept their high beam lights on, even though you were in their field of vision. Those high beams flooded the road with uncontrolled illumination and made it near impossible to keep your eyes focused ahead of you. Using incorrectly designed and low-cost LED low-beam replacement bulbs as headlights in your car can create similar scenarios.Some of the U.S.’s 40,000 annual traffic fatalities could potentially be averted by cracking down on the sale of these dangerous LED low-beam replacement bulbs, but LED replacement bulbs are being sold by third-party, online retailers for both low-beam and high-beam applications in the U.S., even though they are illegal.An estimated 60,000 LED low-beam replacement bulbs are sold online weekly, and nearly two million consumers have installed these illegal bulbs in their cars within the past year. That’s two million chances to be on the wrong side of a bad glare. To make matters more complicated, consumers often purchase these bulbs online under the impression that they are legal and in compliance with the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) regulations.When drivers go to install these replacement bulbs, they’re typically putting them in vehicles with either reflector-based or projector-based headlight assemblies. These are designed for traditional lights, like HID or halogen bulbs, which emit very different light patterns compared to an LED bulb. The difference in beam pattern isn’t accounted for in the designs of illegal LEDs, which can be crafted to sub-par standards. Because of this, there tends to be a mismatch between the LED replacement bulb and the vehicle’s reflector — this is what creates that dangerous glare.For now, there is no regulation in the U.S. that allows manufacturers to design LED low-beam replacement bulbs that pair correctly with vehicles’ reflectors. When the regulations change and provide legal guidance on the design and performance of these bulbs, you will be able to purchase them confidently from industry leaders that offer safe and reliable products.Until then, your best option is to use the technology that your reflectors were originally designed for, such as HID or halogen. The DOT has made it easy to identify safe, legal bulbs — just look for the mark on the bulb that indicates they are DOT-approved. You can do your part to keep our roads safe by purchasing safe and compliant replacement bulbs from an authorized dealer, and by proactively replacing your bulbs in pairs to avoid burn-outs.To learn more about headlight-replacing best practices, visit https://www.sylvania-automotive.com/customer-education/faq/index.jsp."

            "html": "<p>Safety should be paramount on roads — not only for drivers, but for cyclists and pedestrians. One of the easiest ways to make sure everyone stays safe on the road is to have well-functioning headlights.</p><p>Headlights define what drivers can see, and anything that limits their vision increases the risk of accidents for everyone on the road. However, one of the most common issues with headlights today is when they project uncontrolled light, also known as glare. If you’ve ever driven a car, you’ve likely been subject to this glare from oncoming traffic at one point or another — it’s blinding, it’s a safety hazard and it’s often because of illegal LED low-beam replacement bulbs.</p><p>How bad is this glare, really? Think of moments when you’ve driven past cars that kept their high beam lights on, even though you were in their field of vision. Those high beams flooded the road with uncontrolled illumination and made it near impossible to keep your eyes focused ahead of you. Using incorrectly designed and low-cost LED low-beam replacement bulbs as headlights in your car can create similar scenarios.</p><p>Some of the U.S.’s 40,000 annual traffic fatalities could potentially be averted by cracking down on the sale of these dangerous LED low-beam replacement bulbs, but LED replacement bulbs are being sold by third-party, online retailers for both low-beam and high-beam applications in the U.S., even though they are illegal.</p><p>An estimated 60,000 LED low-beam replacement bulbs are sold online weekly, and nearly two million consumers have installed these illegal bulbs in their cars within the past year. That’s two million chances to be on the wrong side of a bad glare. To make matters more complicated, consumers often purchase these bulbs online under the impression that they are legal and in compliance with the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) regulations.</p><p>When drivers go to install these replacement bulbs, they’re typically putting them in vehicles with either reflector-based or projector-based headlight assemblies. These are designed for traditional lights, like HID or halogen bulbs, which emit very different light patterns compared to an LED bulb. The difference in beam pattern isn’t accounted for in the designs of illegal LEDs, which can be crafted to sub-par standards. Because of this, there tends to be a mismatch between the LED replacement bulb and the vehicle’s reflector — this is what creates that dangerous glare.</p><p>For now, there is no regulation in the U.S. that allows manufacturers to design LED low-beam replacement bulbs that pair correctly with vehicles’ reflectors. When the regulations change and provide legal guidance on the design and performance of these bulbs, you will be able to purchase them confidently from industry leaders that offer safe and reliable products.</p><p>Until then, your best option is to use the technology that your reflectors were originally designed for, such as HID or halogen. The DOT has made it easy to identify safe, legal bulbs — just look for the mark on the bulb that indicates they are DOT-approved. You can do your part to keep our roads safe by purchasing safe and compliant replacement bulbs from an authorized dealer, and by proactively replacing your bulbs in pairs to avoid burn-outs.</p><p>To learn more about headlight-replacing best practices, visit <a href=\"https://www.sylvania-automotive.com/customer-education/faq/index.jsp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.sylvania-automotive.com/customer-education/faq/index.jsp</a>.</p>",

And in the darkest moments of the journey, the glimmer of hope on the horizon has been a guiding light.While it’s hard to know what’s around the corner, many travelers with wanderlust are thinking about heading for the horizon in 2021. And while travel may look different in the new year, there are lots of great socially distanced destinations on the map.Nokian Tyres is inviting drivers to report what’s on their horizons. The tire company has created a website — NokianTires.com/Horizons — where users can add road trips they hope to take in 2021. The global leader in safety and sustainability will randomly select entrants to win a free set of tires.Website visitors will also find a road trip tire safety checklist and a guide to Nokian Tyres’ high-quality products. And the tire company also created a list of great road trips for every U.S. state and many Canadian provinces to help fuel journey ideas.Here are some places drivers plan to travel in 2021.Close the hood and head for OregonCraggy coasts, vast volcanoes, lush vineyards, remote forests — it’s hard to match the geographical diversity of Oregon, making the Beaver State a cherished road trip destination.Eclectic Portland is a great home base. In the Rose City, quirky meets classy in a delightful blend that’s as rich as a Willamette pinot noir. From there, it’s time to explore the Beaver State’s wealth of environmental riches.Set your sights east toward towering Mount Hood, which presides over Northwest Oregon from its pulpit 90 miles outside town. Oregon’s highest point stands at 11,250 feet. Head to Government Camp, a pocket-sized tourist town on the side of the slope. It’s home to several shops, restaurants and boutique hotels; you can also hit trails that’ll get you up the mountain.For the best driving experience, install a set of all-weather tires, which are rated for winter weather but suitable for year-round use.Explore mountains of adventure in the Green Mountain StateVermont brushes the shores of Lake Champlain before gracefully rising into the clouds, shrouding a world of adventure and escape that’ll make you glad you visited the Green Mountain State.Start in Burlington, the state’s largest city. Stroll down Church Street for a socially distanced jaunt to immerse yourself in the city’s eclectic culture — part college town, part New England village, part business capital.Then, it’s time to head for the hills. Killington Ski Resort is 60 miles south of the capital city but feels like a world away. It’s the largest ski area in the Eastern United States and boasts the biggest vertical drop in New England — more than 3,000 feet. If it’s summertime and the slopes aren’t frosty white, rent a mountain bike and tackle the hills on wheels instead.Vermont’s winter weather can be severe. A set of winter tires will help you stay safe in sudden snow and ice.Volunteer for a jaunt through TennesseeIf you live in the Eastern U.S., perhaps the mountains are calling. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the most-visited in the country — and for good reason.Carve your way from bucolic Gatlinburg up to Clingmans Dome, Tennessee’s highest point, for stunning views — as long as the Smokies’ namesake haze isn’t shrouding the hills below. Dip your toes in a frigid mountain stream and dive into the trail map for thousands of hiking and backpacking options. And when your head is ready to hit the pillow, book a cabin on the Peaceful Side of the Smokies in Townsend, Tennessee, for a quiet escape. If you’re headed east, rest at renowned Hemlock Inn in Bryson City, North Carolina for a bucolic bed-and-breakfast experience.Just like our tires, we're all eager to get rolling.

            "body": "While the crisp autumn air signals the change of seasons, it also brings fire safety risks associated with fall activities, such as getting cozy around a campfire and burning candles. While spending more time at home and cooking more indoors as cooler weather approaches, it is important to be prepared. According to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA):As temperatures begin to drop, make sure to check out these fire safety tips from First Alert:Be alert while cooking. Cooking fires are expected to continue to increase with more cooking occurring at homes across the country right now, so it is important for you to stay alert and be mindful in the kitchen. Stay in the kitchen while you are frying, grilling, boiling or broiling food. If you are simmering, baking or roasting food, check it regularly, remain in the kitchen and use a timer to remind you that you are cooking. Keep anything that can catch fire — oven mitts, wooden utensils, food packaging or dish towels — away from your stovetop.Play it safe around a campfire. Whether in your backyard or on a campsite, it is important to know how to enjoy a campfire safely. Campfires need to be placed at least 25 feet away from any structure and anything that can burn, such as dry leaves and shrubs. Avoid burning on windy, dry days and never use gasoline or other flammable liquids. Always attend to the campfire and keep a close eye on children while the fire is burning, especially when roasting marshmallows.Practice candle safety. Candles can add lots of ambiance to your indoor and outdoor areas, but they can easily ignite anything that can burn. When burning candles, keep them at least a foot away from anything flammable, never leave them unattended and place them out of reach from children. Make it a routine to check that all flames are extinguished before you leave the area.Be prepared to put out a fire. Fires can spread very quickly and have the potential to cause significant damage. You should always be prepared with a fire extinguishing device nearby, like First Alert EZ Fire Spray. It’s easy to use — just point and spray — and features a familiar lightweight spray-can design to help stop fires fast. Plus, it discharges four times longer than regular extinguishers (based upon approximate size of fire extinguishing vs. 1-A:10-B:C) and is easy to clean up after use. Its small size makes it easy to store, like in your kitchen cabinet, or perfect to have near you around the campfire.Teach kids about fire safety. While many children will be at home this school year, it is important to remind them about staying safe when near an open flame. Teach kids to stop, drop and roll. Talk about the dangers of open flames and run through safety drills so everyone will feel confident to handle a scary situation.“While spending more time at home, it is important to be prepared, such as having a fire extinguishing device nearby and discussing safety with your entire family to help ensure everyone is ready in the event a fire incident occurs,” said Tarsila Wey, director of marketing for First Alert.To learn more about fire safety, visit FirstAlert.com."

As the season changes, insects and other critters are searching for places to hunker down for the cold weather and scoping out new food sources.A recent survey conducted on behalf of Tomcat found that 73% of consumers said they would do whatever it takes to get rid of rodents. Over 21 million households see rodents in their homes every winter, and more than 60 million households experience insects indoors. Insects and rodents can be a real health hazard, bringing dirt and diseases into your house.While everyone is spending more time at home, they’re also noticing signs of unwanted visitors in their homes more than ever before. According to a recent survey conducted by Ortho, the number one reason consumers moved away from a professional pest service in 2020 was COVID-19. For health and safety reasons, many were just not willing to invite new people inside their homes. Instead, they've opted to try to handle the problem themselves.Why wait to discover evidence of pests in your home to take action? If you wait until you see one insect or rodent, there are likely many more already lurking in the nooks, crannies — and walls — of your home. The best way to deal with these unwanted intruders is to be proactive, and keep them out of your house in the first place.To help you better prepare to prevent bugs and rodents from entering your home this fall, Ortho and Tomcat's Gretchen White, Home Pest Scientist, has shared the following tips:1. Keep your home cleanInside:Outside:2. Block them from enteringInsects:According to the Ortho survey, the most common pests homeowners try to get rid of are:Unfortunately, it's hard to keep small insects from entering through holes and cracks you may not even see.One easy solution is to use an indoor barrier product like Ortho Home Defense Max Indoor Insect Barrier against all common household insects. It kills and deters ants, cockroaches, spiders, fleas, ticks, scorpions, beetles, earwigs, silverfish, centipedes, millipedes and more. The fast-drying formula has no fumes and leaves no stains, so you can use it with confidence indoors. People and pets can reenter the space once the product has dried. It spreads easily into cracks, crevices, under appliances and into hard-to-reach places where insects hide. This is the perfect product to use before you even see any insects — putting down a preventative barrier to keep bugs out.Rodents:Rats and mice can enter your home through small holes, cracks or crevices — even as small as a dime. Check your home's exterior for holes or cracks and seal with caulk, expanding foam, or weather-stripping depending on the size and where you find the holes. When possible, use these flexible materials in combination with those that rodents can’t chew through, such as steel wool, hardware cloth, galvanized sheet metal and cement.Those measures aren't fool-proof, however. You can also keep rodents from even trying to come inside by spraying potential points of entry like doors, windows, pipes, cracks, crevices and vents with Tomcat Repellents Rodent Repellent Continuous Spray, which uses essential oil technology to give off a smell and taste rodents naturally hate, but is safe to use around kids and pets when used as directed. It's easy to apply, and features a no-stink, long-lasting rain-resistant formula.Following these tips will help give you peace of mind so you can enjoy your home this fall — and year-round — without the constant worry, annoyance and potential health risks insects and rodents can bring."

This is the perfect product to use before you even see any insects — putting down a preventative barrier to keep bugs out.</p><p><strong>Rodents:</strong></p><p>Rats and mice can enter your home through small holes, cracks or crevices — even as small as a dime. Check your home's exterior for holes or cracks and seal with caulk, expanding foam, or weather-stripping depending on the size and where you find the holes. When possible, use these flexible materials in combination with those that rodents can’t chew through, such as steel wool, hardware cloth, galvanized sheet metal and cement.</p><p>Those measures aren't fool-proof, however. You can also keep rodents from even trying to come inside by spraying potential points of entry like doors, windows, pipes, cracks, crevices and vents with <a href=\"https://www.tomcatbrand.com/en-us/products/mice/tomcat-repellents-rodent-repellent-continuous-spray\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tomcat Repellents Rodent Repellent Continuous Spray</a>, which uses essential oil technology to give off a smell and taste rodents naturally hate, but is safe to use around kids and pets when used as directed. It's easy to apply, and features a no-stink, long-lasting rain-resistant formula.</p><p>Following these tips will help give you peace of mind so you can enjoy your home this fall — and year-round — without the constant worry, annoyance and potential health risks insects and rodents can bring.</p>",

            "summary": "These 6 small lifestyle changes could keep you healthier now.",
            "body": "Life is unpredictable. Between these stressful times and your own personal challenges, you’re probably dealing with more today than perhaps ever. Stress can throw your body, emotions and routine off course, but sometimes even the worst of situations can provide a silver lining. A recent survey found more than half of respondents said they cook more than before the pandemic with 51% stating they will continue to cook more after the crisis ends. Besides healthier eating habits, more than 75% of participants have adopted at least one new wellness habit.According to McKel Kooienga, M.S., R.D.N., L.D.N. of Nutrition Stripped and One A Day brand partner, making small adjustments in key aspects of your day can make a big difference long-term when it comes to supporting your healthy lifestyle.Here are five tips from McKel that will help you:Tip 1: Choose nutritious foodsWhen we think about stress relief, meditation or yoga may come to mind first, but diet can also play an important role in reducing the negative effects of stress on your body. A diet rich in whole foods can provide many benefits, including supporting a healthy immune system and even boosting your mood. Although it can be challenging to eat healthy with limited time, setting aside a few hours a week to food prep can help improve diet and lead to reduced stress levels. So, instead of reaching for takeout menus, cut up veggies for easy grab-and-go snacking, stock your pantry with nutritious options and set yourself and your family up for success.Tip 2: Add a multivitamin Nobody is perfect and it can be difficult to get all of the nutrients you need from food alone. Stress can also deplete many vital vitamins like B vitamins and vitamin E. Adding a multivitamin to your daily routine like One A Day Natural Fruit Bites Multivitamins that offer key vitamins and minerals your body may need in the form of tasty bites made with real farm-grown apples (in the form of apple puree concentrate) can help supplement a healthy diet. These bites support physical energy by helping convert food to fuel and immune and bone health. They are available for the whole family, making it easier to get the key nutrients needed.Step 3: Move More When you exercise your body releases endorphins, which can help you feel better. Not to mention, exercise has also been linked to reduced stress, lower risk of disease and longer lifespan. You don’t have to hit the gym to move. Take a walk outside, check out the many free workouts offered online, or have a dance party with the kids. As long as you pick something you enjoy, it will be easier to stick to.Tip 4: VolunteerAdding purpose to your life may be just what the doctor ordered. Research from the University of Georgia found people who volunteer regularly feel better mentally, physically and emotionally. And the best part? You don’t have to volunteer in person to give back. Packing meals at home to drop off for those in need, fostering or adopting an animal, tutoring students or making virtual calls to the elderly can make a big impact. It’s also something the whole family can do together to feel more connected to the community, all while helping to reduce stress.Tip 5: Take a Digital DetoxIt’s no surprise nearly 80% of Americans are spending more time on screens to ease feelings of isolation, anxiety and disconnection. Technology may seem like a saving grace to many looking for comfort, but increased use contributes to stress and can disrupt quality and length of sleep. Disconnecting entirely may not be possible, but setting boundaries and selecting windows of time to shut off can do wonders for your mental health. Limiting social media use to about 30 minutes per day has been shown to significantly improve well-being by reducing symptoms of depression and loneliness. Whether implementing a no-device policy at meals, trying to go screen free for one day of the week or simply taking a much-needed break from social media, pick something that’s realistic for you and your family.These are just a few simple tips that will help you live your best today no matter what tomorrow brings. Keep a positive attitude and be patient and you'll find your groove again."

But even now, it’s important to remember that you can continue to make a positive impact on your loved one’s life.While you may be unable to physically be with your loved one, remind yourself that what you’re doing from a distance does matter. Careful, thoughtful planning and clear communication may help make remote caregiving easier on you and the person you’re caring for.1. Stay connected. Communicate through video chats whenever possible to help them feel engaged. Encourage family and friends to call often or write letters and notes. You may also be able to set up a medical alert system that can help you track and monitor the person in your care. Look for a system that’s designed with caregivers in mind.2. Get smart with prescriptions. If the person in your care regularly takes medication, talk to his or her pharmacist to see if they offer a mail-order option.

For some, it happens right before or after lunch, for others in the late afternoon. You may reach for a caffeinated beverage or sugary snack to try to boost your energy, but that only offers a short-term fix.What can you do to keep better energy and focus throughout your entire day?Here are a few tips that will not only help you power through your day better but will also improve your overall health — mental and physical.1. Give yourself a breakIf you spend much of your day sitting, taking frequent short breaks to switch up your activity level will help you stay alert. Set a timer on your phone or computer to remind you to get up once or twice every hour to move for five to ten minutes:Anything that gets your blood flowing will perk you up — just don't wait until you're already feeling drowsy to take a break.2. Breathe easyAs part of your regular breaks, or even more frequently, sit up straight in your chair and take a few deep breaths in a row to get more oxygen to your brain. Establish a habit, like taking a deep breath after each email you answer, or before a meeting.If you’re home with the kids, encourage them to join you on your movement and breathing breaks.3. Add a vitamin and nutrient-packed dietary supplement to your routineInstead of reaching for a sugary beverage or tenth cup of coffee, try AdvoCare's Spark energy supplement drink — which delivers energy and enhanced mental focus with a unique blend of 20 vitamins, minerals and nutrients. Vitamins such as A, B-6, B-12, C and E, plus minerals including Zinc, help give your body what it needs to keep going in the afternoon. Spark contains enough caffeine to give you the burst of energy you’re looking for, and is about equal to a strong cup of coffee. It has four grams of sugar, and comes in over 13 different flavors so you can find your favorite. All you do is mix with water — which also helps you stay hydrated!4. Get outsideSunshine provides your body with vitamin D, which is a great, natural pick-me-up, and fresh air encourages deep breathing. Just sitting outside for 15 minutes can help boost your energy — but a short brisk walk outdoors is even better.5. Snack smartWhen you’re getting that sleepy feeling, avoid the temptation of empty carbs and sweet treats. Try keeping healthy snacks nearby like a container of raw nuts or hard-boiled eggs in your refrigerator so you can snack. The protein in nuts and eggs helps give you some sustained energy without the undesirable effects of bingeing on less healthy snacks.6. Sleep wellNothing is more important for maintaining your energy levels than getting enough sleep:Don't wait until you're feeling an energy slump to take good care of yourself. A proactive approach to your health and wellness will help you feel better and stay focused all day long.To learn more about ways to be your best any time of day, visit AdvoCare.com."

            "body": "Many people are surprised to find out that Original Medicare doesn’t generally cover prescription drugs. For help with the cost of your medications, you can choose a stand-alone Part D plan or a Medicare Advantage plan with prescription drug coverage.With Medicare Annual Enrollment fast approaching from Oct. 15 to Dec. 7 — the yearly window when you can make changes to your Medicare coverage — now is a good time to arm yourself with information to help you make an empowered decision this fall.Mike Anderson, CEO of the Medicare Part D program at UnitedHealthcare, recommends you consider these three things when choosing a plan.1. Your drugsPrescription drug plans can vary significantly. Each Part D plan has a list of drugs, called a formulary, which shows the drugs it covers.“When considering a Part D plan, be sure your medications are covered,” Anderson said. “Even if you don’t expect to change plans, it’s important to make sure your drugs will still be covered next year, as plans can change from year to year.”2. Your pharmacyMost Part D plans have preferred pharmacy networks. People can typically get their drugs for a lower copay when they visit preferred pharmacies.“Make sure the plan offers access to pharmacies that are convenient for you,” Anderson said. “Some plans also have mail-order pharmacy benefits, and you can get prescriptions delivered to your home for a lower cost than purchasing from a retail location.”3.

For help with the cost of your medications, you can choose a stand-alone Part D plan or a Medicare Advantage plan with prescription drug coverage.</p><p>With Medicare Annual Enrollment fast approaching from Oct. 15 to Dec. 7 — the yearly window when you can make changes to your Medicare coverage — now is a good time to arm yourself with information to help you make an empowered decision this fall.</p><p>Mike Anderson, CEO of the Medicare Part D program at UnitedHealthcare, recommends you consider these three things when choosing a plan.</p><p><strong>1. Your drugs</strong></p><p>Prescription drug plans can vary significantly. Each Part D plan has a list of drugs, called a formulary, which shows the drugs it covers.</p><p>“When considering a Part D plan, be sure your medications are covered,” Anderson said. “Even if you don’t expect to change plans, it’s important to make sure your drugs will still be covered next year, as plans can change from year to year.”</p><p><strong>2. Your pharmacy</strong></p><p>Most Part D plans have preferred pharmacy networks. People can typically get their drugs for a lower copay when they visit preferred pharmacies.</p><p>“Make sure the plan offers access to pharmacies that are convenient for you,” Anderson said. “Some plans also have mail-order pharmacy benefits, and you can get prescriptions delivered to your home for a lower cost than purchasing from a retail location.”</p><p><strong>3.

To do that, you need to understand your options.Original Medicare (Parts A and B) is provided by the federal government and includes hospital and medical coverage. But it doesn’t cover everything.

In addition, Original Medicare does not cover prescription drugs.If you want additional coverage, there are two ways to get it.2) Does Original Medicare cover dental, vision and hearing care?Original Medicare (Parts A &amp; B) does not cover routine dental, vision or hearing care. Some costs may be covered if you have an eye injury or a certain medical condition, such as diabetes or cataracts.Many Medicare Advantage plans cover dental and vision care, including routine eye exams, eyeglasses or contacts.Medicare Part B covers diagnostic hearing and balance exams if your doctor thinks you may need medical treatment, but neither Part B nor Part A covers routine hearing tests or hearing aids. Many Medicare Advantage plans offer this coverage.3) How can I get coverage for my medications, since Original Medicare doesn’t provide it? You have two options for prescription drug coverage: You can add a standalone Part D plan to Original Medicare, or you can join a Medicare Advantage plan that includes prescription drug coverage.Look for plans that cover the drugs you take. Each plan has a formulary that lists which drugs are covered and what the cost is. Most formularies are tiered, dividing drugs into different levels of cost. Typically, low-tier drugs will cost less than high-tier drugs.4) Why are the costs for my prescription drugs going up? Can I switch plans? Part D prescription drug plans may change copays, premiums, deductibles and other costs from year to year.

Medicare Annual Enrollment runs from Oct. 15 to Dec. 7, so now is a good time for a refresher on key words to inform your coverage decisions for 2021.Deductible, copay and coinsuranceA deductible is the amount you pay out of pocket in a given year for eligible prescription drugs before your plan’s coverage kicks in. The deductible can vary from plan to plan.Some plans charge a copay, a flat fee, each time you fill a prescription. For example, a plan may require you to pay $2 when you fill a prescription for generic drugs and a higher amount for brand-name drugs.With coinsurance, you pay a set percentage of the cost of the drug instead of the flat fee associated with a copay.FormularyPart D plans are offered by private insurance companies, and each plan has what’s known as a formulary, a list of the prescription drugs covered under the plan.“When considering a Part D plan, review the formulary to make sure your medications are covered,” said Mike Anderson, CEO of the Medicare Part D business at UnitedHealthcare.And keep in mind that plan formularies can change from year to year, so don’t assume that the prescription drugs covered under your current plan will carry over in 2021.Drug tiersA Medicare Part D plan’s formulary is made up of tiers, depending on the cost of the medications. The lower tiers generally include preferred generic drugs, and many plans cover these medicines with low or no copay or coinsurance.Higher tiers generally include brand-name drugs and specialty medications and tend to have higher copays or coinsurance. So, talk to your doctor to see if the brand-name prescription you take can be replaced with a generic version.Preferred pharmacy networkA Part D plan may designate a preferred network of pharmacies, and if you use these pharmacies, you can save money on prescriptions.“Make sure the plan offers access to pharmacies that are convenient for you,” Anderson said. “Some plans also have mail-order pharmacy benefits, and you may be able to get prescriptions delivered to your home for a lower cost than purchasing from a retail location.”The donut holeThe majority of Part D plans have a coverage gap known as a “donut hole.” For example, in 2020, you enter this donut hole once your out-of-pocket costs (including deductibles, copays and coinsurance) for prescription drugs reach $4,020. Once you’re in the donut hole, you will pay 25% of the cost of your drugs. In past years, this percentage was higher.In 2020, once your out-of-pocket costs reach $6,350, you exit the donut hole and pay a smaller coinsurance. Your Part D plan tracks your out-of-pocket spend progression and should be accessible on your plan website and monthly statements.If you meet certain income and resource requirements, you may be eligible for Extra Help, which helps qualified beneficiaries pay some or all Medicare Part D premiums, deductibles, co-payments and co-insurance.Learn more Now is a great time to start thinking about your health and budget needs for the upcoming year.

            "body": "Full-time, hybrid and supplemental distance learning have become a fundamental part of education. This isn't just a big adjustment for students; parents and teachers face new challenges as well. Whether you are trying to meaningfully connect with students over Zoom, or stay engaged at home, navigating the difficulties of distance learning causes stress levels to increase for everyone.To keep kids focused on their studies, weary educators and parents are turning to a surprising practice: Kundalini Yoga. Kundalini Yoga postures and breathing practices combined with meditation and mindfulness exercises are helping students handle the challenge of remote learning, easing the pressure put on teachers and parents.How yoga helps studentsRecent research underscores yoga’s benefits for young learners, demonstrating that the practice of yoga is an effective form of social and emotional learning. In one study, a team of researchers including Dr. Sat Bir Singh Khalsa, a Harvard Medical School researcher and director of research for the Kundalini Research Institute, evaluated students who participated in the Kundalini Yoga-based Y.O.G.A. for Youth program. The results confirmed that students who practiced yoga reported feeling less stressed, more resilient and experienced more positive emotions.“With yoga practice, students start developing the ability to regulate their stress and emotions and develop increased awareness of their mind and body,” says Khalsa. “This leads to improved functioning and coping overall, thereby preventing the risk factors for impaired mood, behavior and health.” These skills are always important but are particularly critical for students dealing with dramatic changes to their learning structure.Kundalini Yoga helps build concentration too, along with improving coordination, balance, strength and flexibility. Every student can benefit from incorporating yoga into their school day. To support parents and teachers, here are some tips to get students started.Tip 1: Start small and make it routineWhile a 60-minute yoga class is standard for adults, children don't have the focus or stamina to practice for that long. Try starting with 5- to 10-minute sessions. Set times to do this during the school day, for example, once mid-morning and right after lunch to refocus. Start with gentle breathing and then move through a few easy poses. Forget perfection and encourage kids to try. Soon they'll learn their favorite poses and look forward to these yoga breaks.Tip 2: Be lighthearted and have funStudents — especially younger children — will have a more enjoyable time with their yoga practice if you keep it centered on fun. Be creative by selecting poses based on your kids' favorite animals. Tell stories as you change positions. Integrate games and fun mental visuals into your practice; pretend to take a trip around the world, under the sea or to a far-off imaginary place as you move through poses. Kids’ yoga isn't just about yoga, it's about having fun and being yourself.Tip 3: Teach breathing awarenessJust like adults, when children are nervous, stressed, excited or energetic, their breath quickens to a shorter, faster pace. If you help students become aware of their breath, they can better manage their emotional state. This is done by teaching effective breathing practices. Try using long, deep breaths — a relaxed, slow approach to breathing that involves more movement of the abdomen. This has a direct impact on the autonomic nervous system, which helps kids stay calm and more able to cope with stress.Tip 4: Use meditations and mantrasMantras, words or phrases that are repeated in a chanting manner, are a wonderful way to help kids center themselves. It is soothing during transition periods in particular. Common mantras include “I am,” “peace,” or “calm,” but any phrase or sound will work. Ideally a mantra should reflect the state that you want to be in rather than the one you are in now.Meditations are also great in addressing problems and frustrations that can impact students. For example, when a student feels nervous, they can close their eyes, place their hand on their belly and breathe slowly, feeling the stomach increase and decrease while imagining a balloon gracefully floating on the breeze.Tip 5: Bring in the prosYou don't have to be a yoga expert to teach students yoga basics. However, if you feel uncomfortable or just want some guidance, there are many books and videos about instructing yoga to children. You can even play yoga videos for kids so everyone can participate together. Make sure the resource is from a KRI Certified Kundalini Yoga teacher to ensure proper technique and age-appropriate guidance. Find a trainer near you through the International Kundalini Yoga Teachers Association or Y.O.G.A. for Youth.Remember that distance learning is a challenge for parents and teachers as much as students. By following these tips and Kundalini yoga techniques yourself, you'll be better equipped to help children thrive whether they are in the classroom or studying remotely.

Moms' roles have evolved tremendously during the global pandemic as they're stepping up to meet new challenges and support their family.These extra demands have had a multitude of effects — both positive and negative. While a majority of moms do feel stress, they are also discovering their resiliency and what they value most in life, found a new national survey from DOVE® Chocolate.Overcoming school challengesBeing a parent and educator simultaneously isn't easy, so it's no surprise nearly three out of four moms reported feeling anxious during the stay-at-home orders that began in March and nearly 70% of those surveyed agreed they experienced burnout.Schools are now adopting a variety of learning models, including in-person, hybrid and remote education. Mothers will continue to be called on to support this evolving educational environment, with nearly 40% feeling anxious about the future.Difficult times are challenging, but it's also an opportunity for growth. Mothers are learning through these experiences that they are agile and adaptable. If you're feeling overwhelmed with the new school structure, be kind to yourself. Adjustments take time and it's important to celebrate small successes, for both the kids and yourself. Remember to reach out for support — such as from community programs, the school district and friends — because it takes a village.Finding meaningful moments, peace and connectionAdopting a multitude of new roles plus orders to quarantine and social distance has had a negative impact on many people, but especially moms. Nearly 70% of moms agreed they've experienced feelings of isolation. All moms ranked navigating their new normal — whether it be homeschooling, reduced 'me-time' due to managing more people at home or transitioning to working remotely — as an additional stressor.It's important to remember that taking time for self-care activities is not selfish. When you're the best version of yourself you can be a better mother, partner, friend and colleague. Make time each day for yourself, even if it's just 15 minutes to read, take a walk or meditate. You deserve it.It's also important to prioritize connection even when it's from afar. Plan a weekly video chat with your best friend. Have coffee and catch up with your parents on the phone. Send a handwritten note to another mom who might need encouragement. These small acts compound to make a big impact in your positivity and connection to others.Embracing silver liningsDespite new demands, moms are rising to the occasion plus finding positives by spending extra time with the ones they love most. Having more time with their children ranked as the top positive impact of stay-at-home orders. What's more, many moms benefit from spending more quality time with their partner at home as well.For moms who shifted to working at home, the extra flexibility is also an advantage, allowing them to experience newfound time, milestones and moments with their family. In fact, 84% of working-from-home moms strongly agreed that they grew more emotionally connected with family during stay-at-home orders.This extra time at home may be stressful at times, but try to remind yourself that it is a gift. Rather than running around town from activity to activity, you get extra time to talk with your kids, snuggle, watch movies and play games. You can try new recipes and bake together. You might also explore a hobby or rediscover an interest that you can share with younger generations.The pandemic has been tough for moms who just want to give their families the best while keeping them safe. DOVE® Chocolate hopes all moms can relate to these insights and ultimately, help them feel seen, validated and less alone. Although stressful, there have been opportunities for everyone to grow together while making lasting memories."

            "body": "Flu causes millions of illnesses, hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations, and tens of thousands of deaths in the United States yearly. This year, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get a flu vaccine to protect yourself, your family and your community from flu and its potentially serious consequences.Both flu and COVID-19 are respiratory illnesses that are thought to spread mainly by droplets when people who are infected cough, sneeze or talk. Both flu and COVID-19 can be spread to others before infected people know they are sick.There are also some key differences between flu and COVID-19. COVID-19 seems to spread more easily than flu and causes more serious illnesses in some people. It can also take longer before people show symptoms and people can be contagious for longer. Another important difference is there is a vaccine to protect against flu. There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to the virus.While what will happen this fall and winter is uncertain, CDC is preparing for flu and COVID-19 to spread at the same time. Besides making people sick, this could result in a dangerous public health situation because both diseases can cause serious illness that might require hospitalization. Getting a flu vaccine provides the best protection against flu and is particularly important this year. Flu vaccines help reduce the risk of developing potentially serious flu complications. This is especially important for people with certain long-term health conditions like diabetes, asthma and heart disease. Flu vaccines are also important for people who are 65 years or older who are more likely to get very sick from flu.Reducing the number of people who are sick with flu also can reduce the burden on our medical systems. More people getting vaccinated can mean that fewer people will need to go to doctors’ offices for flu treatment and testing, and fewer people will need to seek urgent medical care or be hospitalized with flu. These reductions in doctor visits and hospitalizations can help save medical resources needed for the care of COVID-19 patients.CDC recommends everyone 6 months and older get their flu vaccine in September or October, or as soon as possible after that. Talk to your healthcare provider, pharmacy, or health department about getting your flu vaccine. Doctors, pharmacists and other health professionals are putting new procedures in place to keep people safe from COVID-19 during vaccination.It’s also important to continue social distancing, wearing a mask and washing hands often — all these actions help slow the spread of respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19 and flu.Not sure where to get a flu vaccine?

            "body": "Since the coronavirus pandemic began, many Americans have canceled or postponed non-emergency doctor visits. At first, practices were temporarily closed, but later patients avoided visits out of fear of exposure to COVID-19.In a Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll from May of this year, nearly half (48%) of respondents said that they or someone in their household had postponed or skipped medical care because of the pandemic. Perhaps not surprisingly, 11% of adults overall reported that their or their family member’s health condition had worsened due to delaying or canceling medical appointments. If you or your child suffers from a chronic condition like allergies or asthma, it is likely you could experience a further decline in your health and well-being by continuing to put off visiting your allergist.If you have allergies and asthma, you need to have your medications and your overall health monitored carefully — and regularly — by an allergist to keep symptoms under control. Allergists are specially trained to help patients manage these conditions effectively, so it’s vital to keep up regular visits to maintain the best possible health outcomes.Health and safety proceduresIf you’re one of the many Americans who haven’t kept up with appointments out of concern for exposure to COVID-19, you can be reassured by the strict safety protocols being implemented by allergists' offices around the country to protect their patients, as well as their staff.“Our first priority as allergists is keeping all our patients and staff safe from COVID-19, while at the same time keeping patients’ allergies and asthma under control,” says J. Allen Meadows, M.D., president of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI). “When you come to the office, know that your allergist has put protocols in place to make your visit both comfortable and safe.”Here are just some of the safety practices being employed by allergists:Why you may need office visitsWhile some issues can be discussed with your allergist using telemedicine, many of the most crucial allergy and asthma treatments and procedures must be performed in the office to ensure that you are getting the best possible health results.Allergy testing: Most patients are given an in-office skin test to detect sensitivity to common household animals (like cats and dogs), dust mites, grasses, trees, weeds and mold. If you're taking medicine that could interfere with allergy test results or if you have very sensitive skin or a serious skin condition, your allergist might perform a blood test instead.Allergy shots: If you are receiving allergy shots, these will need to be administered in person. Allergy shots are given on a schedule designed to increase the amount of the allergen on a regular basis. It's best not to interrupt, skip or postpone the timing of when you get them.Oral food challenges: To confirm or rule out a food allergy, an oral food challenge (OFC) is performed. For an OFC, a person is given a very small dose of a food by mouth at first, followed by increasing doses under the supervision of a board-certified allergist to confirm tolerance or a reaction to the food.Biologics: To receive biologic therapy to treat allergic disorders such as asthma, atopic dermatitis (eczema) or chronic sinus disease, treatments are given by injection in your allergist’s office, at least at first.If you’re behind on appointments to monitor and treat your allergies or asthma, call your allergist today. Ask about their current health and safety procedures so you'll know what to expect when you arrive.Also, if you plan to visit an allergist for the first time, you will need to provide a history of your symptoms, and then the allergist will perform an in-office physical exam. Using this information, the allergist can determine appropriate allergy testing.Need to find a board-certified allergist in your area? Use the ACAAI allergist locator."

For an OFC, a person is given a very small dose of a food by mouth at first, followed by increasing doses under the supervision of a board-certified allergist to confirm tolerance or a reaction to the food.</p><p><strong>Biologics: </strong>To receive biologic therapy to treat allergic disorders such as asthma, atopic dermatitis (eczema) or chronic sinus disease, treatments are given by injection in your allergist’s office, at least at first.</p><p>If you’re behind on appointments to monitor and treat your allergies or asthma, call your allergist today. Ask about their current health and safety procedures so you'll know what to expect when you arrive.</p><p>Also, if you plan to visit an allergist for the first time, you will need to provide a history of your symptoms, and then the allergist will perform an in-office physical exam. Using this information, the allergist can determine appropriate allergy testing.</p><p>Need to find a board-certified allergist in your area?

Thanks to greater accessibility, it’s easier than ever to take care of your symptoms from home, observing safe social distancing without having to regularly visit an allergist to seek relief. And given the pandemic (and the upcoming flu season), it’s increasingly important to maintain your general health so you can better fight off illnesses of all kinds.If you’re struggling with the misery that can result from seasonal allergies, you’re far from alone. According to the CDC, more than 50 million Americans are now dealing with some kind of allergy, making such afflictions the sixth most prevalent cause of chronic illness in the country. And with symptoms that can be mistaken for the novel coronavirus, seasonal allergies could be causing even more stress and anxiety for sufferers.The good news? These days, many allergies can be safely identified with minimal visits to healthcare providers and then treated from home. And that could provide better relief from your symptoms as well as greater peace of mind.“For millions of Americans, the impact of seasonal allergies can extend well beyond just the clinical symptoms — missed work and school days, avoidance of the outdoors, and limitation of desired activities. Currently, allergy sufferers are also facing uncertainty and fear that they might be suffering from COVID-19 due to some similarity amongst symptoms,” says Amanda Hofmann, vice president, clinical at United Allergy Services. “But fortunately, you can get clear answers as to what may be causing you trouble, as well as significant relief. And it’s more convenient and safer than you may think.”The more you understand about your seasonal allergies, the easier it will be for you to form a treatment plan. Here are some facts to know:Thankfully, United Allergy Services (UAS) offers allergy testing and immunotherapy treatment in a safe, convenient way. By working through your general provider to develop a treatment protocol that can be self-administered, relief for allergy sufferers can happen with minimal visits to the provider's office or pharmacy. In fact, after the initial allergy test, which is administered in the general provider’s office, patients can undergo the majority of their treatment from the safety of their own homes.“While I can assure my patients that we are doing everything we can to ensure our office is a safe and sterile environment, I understand the fact that currently a lot of people still feel most comfortable staying home,” said Dr. Gregory Fuller in Keller, Texas. “But fear of COVID-19 shouldn’t prevent you from getting quality care. At-home allergy immunotherapy allows me to treat my patients’ symptoms in a way they feel most comfortable.”This season, there’s no reason to put off taking control of your seasonal allergies.

A wave of new research has demonstrated that implementing practices like meditation can increase mind-body awareness/mindfulness, raise self-esteem, improve concentration, strengthen memory and prevent depression.An example that is trending for its effectiveness and accessibility is the Kirtan Kriya meditation. A type of meditation from the Kundalini Yoga tradition, Kirtan Kriya has been shown to reduce symptoms of depression and dementia, while being beneficial to both mood and overall mental wellness.Scientific supportRecent studies show the numerous mental health benefits of this non-religious, meditative practice. For example, researchers out of UCLA, West Virginia University, and the Alzheimer’s Research and Prevention Foundation have used functional imaging studies, genomics, biomarkers, and neurocognitive testing to study the effects of Kundalini Yoga and Kirtan Kriya on individuals with cognitive decline over six months.Intervention groups practicing Kirtan Kriya saw improvements to memory and cognitive functioning as well as improved mood and quality of life. These findings are supported by other research studies on the practice, with Kirtan Kriya meditation shown to improve blood flow to the brain, reverse memory loss and ease depression.

To make Kirtan Kriya meditations part of your mental hygiene routine, follow these steps:Position:Sit comfortably in a chair with feet flat on the floor or sit on the floor with legs crossed. The key is to be comfortable with the spine straight. Keep eyes closed and breathe naturally as the meditation unfolds.Mantra or Chant:The chant uses the basic sounds, “Sah, Tah, Nah, Mah”, taken from the Sikh words “Sat Nam,” meaning “my true identity.” Mudra or Hand Position:The thumb is touched to each of the other four fingers in sequence. Both hands perform the same sequence simultaneously.When you chant Sah, touch the index fingers of each hand to the thumbs.On Tah, touch your middle fingers to your thumbs.On Nah, touch your ring fingers to your thumbs.On Mah, touch your little fingers to your thumbs.The Timing:Sing the sounds “Sah, Tah, Nah, Mah” while performing the mudras sequence with the fingers of both hands. At the same time, visualize the sound flowing in through the top of the head and out the middle of the forehead.For one minute, sing the sounds out loud.For one minute, use a loud whisper.For the next two minutes, repeat the sounds silently to yourself.Then whisper the sounds for one minute and then sing out loud for one minute, for a total meditation time of six minutes.To come out of the exercise, inhale very deeply, stretch hands above the head while stretching the fingers wide.

            "body": "Whether fall is when you switch out your exercise regimen or schedule your annual flu shot, staying healthy is at the top of most “to do” lists right now. Just remember your four-legged family members when considering seasonal changes to your wellness program. Fall is the perfect time to take steps to keep pets healthy, too.1) Plan that vet visit. Annual check-ups that include immunizations, physical exams, routine blood work and prescription refills are as important to pet health as they are to human health. Routine wellness visits can also save pet-care dollars in the long run through preventive care and early disease detection. If your pet missed his or her annual check-up last spring, consider getting that visit rescheduled. Most veterinarians offer pet wellness appointments with curbside drop-off and pick-up to help safeguard owners’ health.2) Get off the couch. Summer’s heat is giving way to cooler temperatures, so resist the temptation to forgo your dog’s evening walk for yet another movie marathon. Not only will outdoor exercise help whittle your pet’s waistline and promote joint health, but getting outside to enjoy the fall colors can boost your own caloric burn and mental outlook as well.3) Don’t “fall” back on parasite prevention. Just because you aren’t slapping mosquitoes like you did in July doesn’t mean you should stop protecting your pets from parasites. The American Heartworm Society recommends giving heartworm preventives — many of which prevent a host of common parasites — to dogs and cats year-round. While heartworms are spread by mosquitoes, it’s nearly impossible to guess when you’ll see the last one in the fall or the first one next spring. Disease-carrying mosquitoes can also survive as temperatures drop by migrating indoors or to protected areas near houses and other buildings.4) Rethink your pet’s fall wardrobe. Protective wearables make more than a fashion statement for many pets. Arthritic senior dogs, as well as short-haired dogs or lean breeds that chill easily, will be more comfortable if you slip on a cozy fleece coat when clipping on their leash. Just make sure your pup’s garment has a snug vs. a tight fit — and consider coats with reflective fabric if you favor nighttime walks. And if your fall activities include hunting with your dog, make sure to outfit your four-legged companion with a hunting vest.5) Hide the Halloween treats. Whether or not your kids go trick-or-treating this year, you may be making plans to stock up on Halloween candy. Just remember that certain human treats may be toxic to your pets. Chocolate is hazardous to both dogs and cats, sugar can throw off your pet’s electrolyte balance and certain artificial sweeteners can cause liver failure in dogs. So go ahead and keep the candy to yourself. Just keep it away from your pets while you’re at it.Staying healthy has never felt more important than it does this fall. Do your pets a favor and prioritize their health, too."

            "summary": "",
            "body": "Shortness of breath. Heart palpitations. When Danita first noticed these occasional abnormalities, she didn’t give them much thought. After all, she figured, aging and menopause can bring their fair share of physical changes, and the feelings would always go away.“I’d be walking around the house cleaning or getting ready to cook, and I would get a heart palpitation. I would sit down, rest and then continue what I was doing because the symptoms would be gone,” she explained.After noticing periodic symptoms, Danita’s colleague convinced her to see a doctor. Soon after, she learned what she had been experiencing was actually something serious: a common type of arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat, called atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation, known as AFib for short, causes the heart to beat much faster than normal. For those who have AFib, risk of having a stroke increases by approximately five times.Danita’s story may seem rare, but in fact, AFib is projected to affect around 8.4 million Americans in 2020. 'It's important to know about AFib and the risk of stroke. However, in my experience, many people don't know about AFib,' explained Andrea Russo, M.D., immediate past-president of the Heart Rhythm Society and director of electrophysiology and arrhythmia services at Cooper University Hospital.According to a Harris Poll survey of 1,010 U.S. adults fielded on behalf of the Bristol Myers Squibb-Pfizer Alliance educational initiative, Matter of Moments, the majority of people over the age of 40 are unfamiliar with AFib. The Matter of Moments program encourages those at risk for AFib who are experiencing symptoms, or those who already have the condition, to take charge of their health by talking to their doctor.Although learning about the condition was scary at first, Danita now feels empowered to continue working with her doctor to help manage her AFib and to spread awareness of the condition so that others can do the same. “I keep up with my cardiologist to make sure I’m doing OK.”Luckily, she’s also been able to help others learn more about the condition, like her sister, who was experiencing symptoms similar to her own. Danita recognized those symptoms and encouraged her to go see a doctor, which led to her AFib diagnosis. While AFib cannot be self-diagnosed, awareness of AFib risk factors and symptoms may help people identify when they may need to speak to their doctor.AFib and stroke: What’s the connection?In a patient with AFib, your heart beats much faster than normal. When this happens, the blood cannot effectively move from the upper chambers of the heart to the lower chambers of the heart, which may lead to blood pooling in the heart, potentially forming a clot. If that blood clot enters the bloodstream and gets stuck in an artery that leads to the brain, it can cause a life-threatening or debilitating stroke. For people with AFib, risk of having a stroke increases by approximately five times. Furthermore, AFib-related strokes are more severe than non-AFib related strokes.What are some symptoms of AFib?All patients may not experience AFib symptoms in the same way, so the condition may not be obvious to those living with AFib. Some have no symptoms, but those who do may experience shortness of breath or heart palpitations, like Danita, or other symptoms including irregular heartbeat, light-headedness, chest pain or fatigue, among others.What are some risk factors for AFib?For Danita, after learning more about the condition, she realized that she had AFib risk factors, like being overweight and having a history of heart disease in her family. Other AFib risk factors include but are not limited to, being 65 or older, diabetes, high blood pressure, sleep apnea, heavy alcohol use, prior heart attacks and diabetes.Talk to a doctorFor Danita, like many adults with AFib, learning that she had AFib came as a complete surprise, and she was equally unfamiliar with what the diagnosis meant. “I wish I had known AFib existed. I had never even heard of the condition, otherwise I would have been more proactive about speaking with my doctor,” she stated. “I was in bad shape and I didn’t know it.”This AFib Awareness Month, commit to getting the facts about AFib and stroke risk. If you’re experiencing symptoms or have AFib risk factors, talk to your doctor to take charge of your health. Outside of in-person appointments, telehealth may also be a possible option to get in touch with your physician, address pressing health needs and learn about AFib and the associated stroke risk. Some common questions to ask your doctor are:Already diagnosed with AFib?In the case that you have already been diagnosed with AFib, it’s important to work with your doctor to help manage the condition and talk about a plan that may be right for you.While an AFib diagnosis can impact people differently, collaborating with a doctor allows you to be proactively involved in the management of your health.About the Matter of Moments survey: This survey was conducted online by The Harris Poll on behalf of the Bristol Myers Squibb-Pfizer Alliance among 1,010 U.S. adults 40+ and 500 atrial fibrillation (AFib) patients ages 40+ between May 9 and May 28, 2019. Figures for age by gender, education, income, race/ethnicity, region, size of household, marital status and employment status were weighted where necessary to bring them into line with their actual proportions in their respective population.

The <em>Matter of Moments</em> program encourages those at risk for AFib who are experiencing symptoms, or those who already have the condition, to take charge of their health by talking to their doctor.</p><p>Although learning about the condition was scary at first, Danita now feels empowered to continue working with her doctor to help manage her AFib and to spread awareness of the condition so that others can do the same. “I keep up with my cardiologist to make sure I’m doing OK.”</p><p>Luckily, she’s also been able to help others learn more about the condition, like her sister, who was experiencing symptoms similar to her own. Danita recognized those symptoms and encouraged her to go see a doctor, which led to her AFib diagnosis. While AFib cannot be self-diagnosed, awareness of AFib risk factors and symptoms may help people identify when they may need to speak to their doctor.</p><p><strong>AFib and stroke: What’s the connection?</strong></p><p>In a patient with AFib, your heart beats much faster than normal. When this happens, the blood cannot effectively move from the upper chambers of the heart to the lower chambers of the heart, which may lead to blood pooling in the heart, potentially forming a clot. If that blood clot enters the bloodstream and gets stuck in an artery that leads to the brain, it can cause a life-threatening or debilitating stroke. For people with AFib, risk of having a stroke increases by approximately five times. Furthermore, AFib-related strokes are more severe than non-AFib related strokes.</p><p><strong>What are some symptoms of AFib?</strong></p><p>All patients may not experience AFib symptoms in the same way, so the condition may not be obvious to those living with AFib. Some have no symptoms, but those who do may experience shortness of breath or heart palpitations, like Danita, or other symptoms including irregular heartbeat, light-headedness, chest pain or fatigue, among others.</p><p><strong>What are some risk factors for AFib?</strong></p><p>For Danita, after learning more about the condition, she realized that she had AFib risk factors, like being overweight and having a history of heart disease in her family. Other AFib risk factors include but are not limited to, being 65 or older, diabetes, high blood pressure, sleep apnea, heavy alcohol use, prior heart attacks and diabetes.</p><p><strong>Talk to a doctor</strong></p><p>For Danita, like many adults with AFib, learning that she had AFib came as a complete surprise, and she was equally unfamiliar with what the diagnosis meant. “I wish I had known AFib existed. I had never even heard of the condition, otherwise I would have been more proactive about speaking with my doctor,” she stated. “I was in bad shape and I didn’t know it.”</p><p>This AFib Awareness Month, commit to getting the facts about AFib and stroke risk. If you’re experiencing symptoms or have AFib risk factors, talk to your doctor to take charge of your health. Outside of in-person appointments, telehealth may also be a possible option to get in touch with your physician, address pressing health needs and learn about AFib and the associated stroke risk. Some common questions to ask your doctor are:</p><p><strong>Already diagnosed with AFib?</strong></p><p>In the case that you have already been diagnosed with AFib, it’s important to work with your doctor to help manage the condition and talk about a plan that may be right for you.</p><p>While an AFib diagnosis can impact people differently, collaborating with a doctor allows you to be proactively involved in the management of your health.</p><p><strong>About the Matter of Moments survey:</strong> <br>This survey was conducted online by The Harris Poll on behalf of the Bristol Myers Squibb-Pfizer Alliance among 1,010 U.S. adults 40+ and 500 atrial fibrillation (AFib) patients ages 40+ between May 9 and May 28, 2019. Figures for age by gender, education, income, race/ethnicity, region, size of household, marital status and employment status were weighted where necessary to bring them into line with their actual proportions in their respective population.

            "body": "Flu causes millions of illnesses, hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations, and tens of thousands of deaths in the United States yearly. This year, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to get a flu vaccine to protect yourself, your family and your community from flu and its potentially serious consequences.Both flu and COVID-19 are respiratory illnesses that are thought to spread mainly by droplets when people who are infected cough, sneeze or talk. Both flu and COVID-19 can be spread to others before infected people know they are sick.There are also some key differences between flu and COVID-19. COVID-19 seems to spread more easily than flu and causes more serious illnesses in some people. It can also take longer before people show symptoms and people can be contagious for longer. Another important difference is there is a vaccine to protect against flu. There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to the virus.While what will happen this fall and winter is uncertain, CDC is preparing for flu and COVID-19 to spread at the same time. Besides making people sick, this could result in a dangerous public health situation because both diseases can cause serious illness that might require hospitalization. Getting a flu vaccine provides the best protection against flu and is particularly important this year. Flu vaccines help reduce the risk of developing potentially serious flu complications. This is especially important for people with certain long-term health conditions like diabetes, asthma and heart disease. Flu vaccines are also important for people who are 65 years or older who are more likely to get very sick from flu.Reducing the number of people who are sick with flu also can reduce the burden on our medical systems. More people getting vaccinated can mean that fewer people will need to go to doctors’ offices for flu treatment and testing, and fewer people will need to seek urgent medical care or be hospitalized with flu. These reductions in doctor visits and hospitalizations can help save medical resources needed for the care of COVID-19 patients.CDC recommends everyone 6 months and older get their flu vaccine in September or October, or as soon as possible after that. Talk to your healthcare provider, pharmacy, or health department about getting your flu vaccine. Doctors, pharmacists and other health professionals are putting new procedures in place to keep people safe from COVID-19 during vaccination.It’s also important to continue social distancing, wearing a mask and washing hands often — all these actions help slow the spread of respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19 and flu.Not sure where to get a flu vaccine?

            "body": "If you’re trying to improve your heart health, chances are you’re doing things like moving more and eating better. Making sure your diet delivers heart-healthy nutrients, including healthy fats, is a smart strategy. A new study from Mayo Clinic Proceedings provides more evidence on why certain fats — namely EPA and DHA omega-3s — are so important, and why you probably need to be getting even more than you think.What are EPA and DHA omega-3s?Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are the two most beneficial omega-3 fats. EPA and DHA are found in marine foods like fish (primarily fatty fish such as salmon, mussels, anchovies and sardines) and are important for overall health, including heart, brain and eye health throughout life; during pregnancy for both mom and her growing baby; and for brain and eye development in infants.While most Americans know what omega-3s are, 95% are not getting enough EPA and DHA omega-3s in their diets. The body doesn’t make enough EPA and DHA on its own, so they must be obtained from the foods you eat and supplements you take.New study shows the impact of EPA and DHA on heart healthThe omega-3 research published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings is the most comprehensive analysis to date on EPA and DHA dosage and its role in cardiovascular prevention, with a review of 40 clinical trials. The authors conclude that EPA and DHA omega-3s are associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease, the number one cause of death for Americans, and reduced risk of heart attack, including fatal heart attack.“The evidence continues to support the notion that EPA and DHA intake contribute to cardioprotection, and that whatever you may be getting through the diet, you likely need even more,” said Dr. Carl “Chip” Lavie, a cardiologist and one of the authors of the study.One of the more striking findings in the study is that benefits appear to increase with dosage. For example, an extra 1,000 milligrams per day of EPA and DHA decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease and heart attack even more. (Note: Study results included dosages up to 5,500 milligrams.)“People should consider the benefits of omega-3 supplements, at doses of 1,000 to 2,000 mg per day — far higher than what is typical, even among people who regularly eat fish,” added Lavie.“Taking omega-3 supplements is a relatively low-cost, high-impact way to improve heart health with few associated risks.”How to boost your EPA and DHA intakeThe average intake of EPA and DHA omega-3s in the U.S. is about 100 mg per day, far below the recommended amount of 1,000 mg per day supported by the Mayo Clinic Proceedings paper.To get more EPA and DHA omega-3s:Look for a quality supplementOmega-3 supplements are like an insurance policy for your heart, brain and eyes, especially if you’re not eating enough fatty fish each week. When choosing a supplement, read the “Supplement Facts” panel on the packaging for the amount of EPA and DHA per serving, and how much you need to take to get a full serving.

However, recent conversations about sustainability and the beef industry’s commitment to continued improvement have led to research on the issue — which has only served to demonstrate that the beef industry does in fact employ sustainability practices throughout each stage of the production process.Today's farmers and ranchers supplying beef to the U.S. and around the world have been engaging in more sustainable practices than ever before. Studies conducted in recent years offer a bigger picture of the actual impact of beef production in the U.S., and how it compares to environmental challenges around the world.Here are five surprising facts about beef production in the U.S. you may not know.1. Far lower greenhouse gas emissions than other sourcesGreenhouse gas emissions from beef cattle only represent 2% of total emissions in the U.S., according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency. By contrast, transportation accounts for 29% of GHG emissions, and electricity accounts for nearly 28% of GHG emissions in the United States. Beef cattle production as a whole, including production of animal feed, is responsible for only 3.7% of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S.Sources: 2. Lower global carbon footprint The U.S. is a leader in sustainable beef production, with a carbon footprint 10-50 times lower than in other regions worldwide, despite being the third largest producer of beef globally. The U.S. produces 18% of the world’s beef — with only 6% of the world’s cattle.Sources: 3. Reduced emissions over 30 yearsBetween 1977 and 2007, the U.S. beef industry has reduced the carbon footprint of beef cattle by more than 16% while producing slightly more beef, thanks to continued improvement in sustainability practices and more effective use of resources.Sources: 4. Increased carbon storageToday, U.S. grasslands utilized by the beef industry sequester and store 7.4 Pg carbon — which is the equivalent of taking 5.76 billion cars off the road. By 2050, grasslands are projected to sequester 8.2 Pg carbon, which is equivalent to removing 6.383 billion cars each year (average car emissions of 4.6 CO2e metric tons per year).Sources: 5. Plants converted to proteinCattle not only upcycle, they recycle. Beef cattle generate more protein for the human food supply than would exist without them, because their unique digestive system allows them to convert human-inedible plants into high-quality protein. In the face of growing global population, animals like beef cattle are needed to help make more protein with less.In addition, approximately 35% of the land in the contiguous U.S. is pasture and range land that is too rocky, steep or arid to support cultivated agriculture, yet this land supports cattle, sheep and goats — leading to protein upcycling.Sources: 'In the face of a growing global population, we need ruminant animals, like beef cattle, to help make more protein with less, and we’ve proven in the U.S. that beef can be raised sustainably,' said Myriah Johnson, Senior Director of Sustainability Research at the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, a contractor to the Beef Checkoff.The U.S. industry leads the world in sustainable beef production while serving as a pillar of rural economies and providing a nutrient-rich source of protein for U.S. and worldwide consumers.Learn more about beef and sustainability at BeefItsWhatsforDinner.com."

            "body": "Healthy sleep is vital for student success. Yet, a new survey from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) shows that many students are not getting enough sleep, according to more than half of American parents surveyed. No matter where classes are held — in-person, online or in a hybrid format — the group is highlighting the importance of healthy sleep for students.“As many parents and caregivers try to create a routine for their kids, incorporating the right amount of healthy sleep is an important component,” said AASM President Dr. Kannan Ramar.What’s keeping kids up on school nights?From classwork to social media use, there are many things competing for the attention of school-aged children and teens, interfering with their nightly sleep. According to 90% of parents, homework and early school start times are the top barriers impacting the healthy sleep students need each night, followed by time with friends (87%), social media/electronics use (86%), hobbies (86%), sports (85%), chores or jobs (83%), and band/music/clubs (78%).COVID-19 impact on sleep consistencyAnother disrupter to sleep?

According to the survey, four out of 10 parents acknowledge that remote learning affects their children’s bedtime and/or waketime consistency.“Even though students may not need to catch the bus or carpool this school year, they should continue with morning and bedtime rituals, including getting up and going to bed at regular times so they get enough sleep,” added Ramar.Parents are aware of impact of sleepAbout 94% of parents acknowledge that sleep impacts their children’s mood, and 93% understand its correlation to performance in school.

            "body": "While there is growing public awareness about cancer in general, there are many types of cancer that are not well known or are misunderstood.On September 30, the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) and its Rare Cancer Coalition are spearheading the second annual Rare Cancer Day.This awareness day aims to activate, inspire and educate the public about the rare cancers that can affect people's health.One of those rare cancers is cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). CCA is a rare cancer that forms in the bile ducts, which are tubes connecting the gallbladder and liver to a person’s small intestine. These tubes carry bile (a fluid made in the liver that helps the body digest the fat in food) to the small intestine after a person eats, aiding in digestion.[1]How rare is CCA?According to the American Cancer Society, fewer than 10,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with CCA each year.[2]What are the risk factors for CCA?The following may increase one's risk of CCA[3]:Symptoms of CCAUnfortunately, CCA is hard to diagnose, because many of the symptoms resemble other, more common health issues. Therefore, CCA is often overlooked by doctors.[4]You should see your doctor if you are experiencing any of the following symptoms, which could be signs of CCA — or other potentially serious health concerns[5]:Because of the difficulties in diagnosing CCA correctly, the disease is often not diagnosed until it has reached an advanced stage or metastasized, after doctors have taken a lot of time and effort to conduct additional testing to eliminate other possible causes of a patient's symptoms. The late diagnosis of CCA can then limit the patient's potential treatment options, resulting in a poor prognosis.[6]Managing CCASurgery, or resection, is one of the only potentially curative treatments for CCA, but many patients are ineligible — and even after surgery, relapse rates are high.[7]However, it is possible to evaluate patients' disease once they've been diagnosed with CCA and has been deemed ineligible for surgery, which in turn could open the door to more options. Called molecular profiling, this technique can help doctors identify unique gene changes or defects in a person's tumor.[8]If you have recently received a diagnosis for CCA, ask your doctor about the possibility of conducting molecular profiling. Identifying the exact type of mutations or abnormalities in rare cancer types such as CCA can help healthcare providers better understand the disease, and therefore offer treatment, resulting in better health outcomes for the patient.Awareness of rare cancers is the first step. In recognition of the day, NORD encourages everyone to broaden their knowledge of rare cancers and to support and advocate for the rare cancer community — not only on Rare Cancer Day, but every day.

            "body": "Roughly 1.8 million people will be diagnosed with cancer in the United States in 2020, according to the National Cancer Institute.[1] Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)—the most common type of acute leukemia—is an aggressive blood cancer characterized by the rapid growth of cells that accumulate in the bone marrow.[2],[3],[4]AML can occur at any age but is more common among older patients.[5] Some patients may experience a relapse during their journey or their disease may not improve after previous treatment, which is known as refractory disease.[6]Genetic testing can inform treatment decisions Genes provide the instructions for everything that happens in the human body, acting like codes that result in unique characteristics like eye color and hair color.[5],[7] Sometimes, changes known as mutations can happen, instructing the body to do harmful things—like develop cancers such as AML.[8],[9]AML is caused by mutations in leukemia cells.[9] The most common type of mutation in AML occurs in the FLT3 gene, and affects approximately 30% of newly diagnosed patients. FLT3 mutations are associated with a higher relapse rate, faster progression and shorter overall survival.[10],[11]Progress has been made in understanding the underlying molecular genetics of AML, but many patients continue to be managed with treatment approaches that are not targeted to their specific AML subtype.Dr. Eunice Wang, Chief of Leukemia at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, recognizes a shift in how physicians are approaching the treatment of AML, but more awareness around genetic mutation testing is needed in order to better inform treatment options.“When I first started practicing as an oncologist, chemotherapy was the only option for patients with AML,” Dr. Wang said. “Today, the field is transforming, with an explosion of new therapies and potential treatment choices for patients with AML. It is critical patients undergo genetic testing for mutations in order to determine the most effective personalized treatment plan.”What happens when patients relapse or are refractory to treatment (R/R)?It is recommended patients with AML receive testing for genetic mutations when first diagnosed. However, it's important to understand that genetic mutations can change over the course of a patient’s AML journey. For example, patients could test negative for a FLT3 mutation at diagnosis, and then test positive at relapse.[6],[11],[12],[13]In AML, identifying updated mutation status through retesting at relapse can help inform care decisions and is valuable to healthcare teams when determining the appropriate treatment options for patients.[6]Learn more and ask questionsThe new Be R/Ready website, sponsored by Astellas, strives to be a resource for people to learn about relapsed or refractory AML, the importance of genetic testing, and in particular, the role of FLT3 mutations.The goal of Be R/Ready is to empower, provide increased awareness, and stress the essential need for communication between patients, caregivers and their health care team. On the website, a discussion guide is available for patients with foundational questions to help start the conversation, such as:Visit BeAMLready.com for more information and to access the full discussion guide that can be used for notes and information gathering at your next doctor’s appointment.Sponsored by Astellas[1] National Cancer Institute.

            "html": "<p>Roughly 1.8 million people will be diagnosed with cancer in the United States in 2020, according to the National Cancer Institute.[1] Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)—the most common type of acute leukemia—is an aggressive blood cancer characterized by the rapid growth of cells that accumulate in the bone marrow.[2],[3],[4]</p><p>AML can occur at any age but is more common among older patients.[5] Some patients may experience a relapse during their journey or their disease may not improve after previous treatment, which is known as refractory disease.[6]</p><p><strong>Genetic testing can inform treatment decisions </strong></p><p>Genes provide the instructions for everything that happens in the human body, acting like codes that result in unique characteristics like eye color and hair color.[5],[7] Sometimes, changes known as mutations can happen, instructing the body to do harmful things—like develop cancers such as AML.[8],[9]</p><p>AML is caused by mutations in leukemia cells.[9] The most common type of mutation in AML occurs in the FLT3 gene, and affects approximately 30% of newly diagnosed patients. FLT3 mutations are associated with a higher relapse rate, faster progression and shorter overall survival.[10],[11]</p><p>Progress has been made in understanding the underlying molecular genetics of AML, but many patients continue to be managed with treatment approaches that are not targeted to their specific AML subtype.</p><p>Dr. Eunice Wang, Chief of Leukemia at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, recognizes a shift in how physicians are approaching the treatment of AML, but more awareness around genetic mutation testing is needed in order to better inform treatment options.</p><p>“When I first started practicing as an oncologist, chemotherapy was the only option for patients with AML,” Dr. Wang said. “Today, the field is transforming, with an explosion of new therapies and potential treatment choices for patients with AML. It is critical patients undergo genetic testing for mutations in order to determine the most effective personalized treatment plan.”</p><p><strong>What happens when patients relapse or are refractory to treatment (R/R)?</strong></p><p>It is recommended patients with AML receive testing for genetic mutations when first diagnosed. However, it's important to understand that genetic mutations can change over the course of a patient’s AML journey. For example, patients could test negative for a FLT3 mutation at diagnosis, and then test positive at relapse.[6],[11],[12],[13]</p><p>In AML, identifying updated mutation status through retesting at relapse can help inform care decisions and is valuable to healthcare teams when determining the appropriate treatment options for patients.[6]</p><p><strong>Learn more and ask questions</strong></p><p>The new <a href=\"http://www.BeAMLReady.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Be R/Ready</strong></a> website, sponsored by Astellas, strives to be a resource for people to learn about relapsed or refractory AML, the importance of genetic testing, and in particular, the role of FLT3 mutations.</p><p>The goal of Be R/Ready is to empower, provide increased awareness, and stress the essential need for communication between patients, caregivers and their health care team. On the website, a discussion guide is available for patients with foundational questions to help start the conversation, such as:</p><p>Visit <a href=\"http://www.BeAMLReady.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>BeAMLready.com</strong></a> for more information and to access the full discussion guide that can be used for notes and information gathering at your next doctor’s appointment.</p><p><em>Sponsored by Astellas</em></p><p><a title=\"\" href=\"#_ednref1\" rel=\"nofollow\" name=\"_edn1\">[1]</a> National Cancer Institute.

            "body": "By now, most seniors are aware that they’re among the most vulnerable demographic groups when it comes to contracting COVID-19.That said, a recent nationwide poll by Tivity Health®, a national provider of senior fitness, nutrition and healthy lifestyle solutions, including SilverSneakers®, the nation's leading community fitness program designed for older adults, indicates many are probably not getting the exercise they need to maintain optimal health.In the poll, 46% of adult and senior respondents said the pandemic is preventing them from attending in-person exercise classes at local gyms, although 84% noted they’ll return within a month once attendance is deemed safe by authorities.A core challenge is reduced gym access, as quarantines prove problematic for many older Americans trying to continue exercise regimens. Exercise remains critical for seniors to maintain a healthy immune system that’s able to fight off disease. Regular workouts can also increase balance and strength and help prevent falls.For seniors, falls are an all too common threat and crisis; Johns Hopkins University reports that 25% of adults 65 or older fall, and three million are treated in emergency rooms each year for injuries caused by falls.“This pandemic has brought great challenges and stress for seniors. But the good news is, there are ways to exercise safely and maintain an active lifestyle,” says Tivity Health president and CEO Richard Ashworth. “Exercise is vital for maintaining optimal health, and through easy-to-access digital and in-person options, it is our hope seniors can continue or renew exercise regimens quickly and safely.”Maintaining regular exercise during COVID-19 need not be difficult. If you’re a senior wanting to maintain effective workouts each day, here are some tips you can follow even if you’re practicing social isolation.Start slowly. If you haven’t been exercising, you’ll want to ease into your new routine gradually. Studies indicate just two weeks of inactivity (or a 75% reduction in daily steps) can decrease your muscle strength by 8%, while dropping 1,000 to 1,500 steps each day can both raise both inflammation and blood pressure. You should jump-start your new regimen with safe exercises like squats, wall push-ups, light weightlifting regimens and taking walks (keeping distance from others for safety).Subscribe to a digital exercise program. You do not need to leave your home to exercise each day. That’s especially true if you sign up for a high-quality digital regimen that fits well with your exercise goals and preferences.In fact, 56% of seniors responding to the Tivity Health poll said their future workout plans call for participating in online classes two to three times per week. You may find SilverSneakers’ LIVE classes are your perfect option; the instructor-led online exercise sessions are being offered to all SilverSneakers members. In addition, free Facebook Live classes led by SilverSneakers national trainers are broadcast multiple times a week. The national fitness membership organization designed the virtual series to help seniors stay in shape while still following precautions during the pandemic.Avoid prolonged sitting. Even if you must set a timer to remind yourself, take frequent breaks from sitting and engage in rejuvenating strolls — or simply take part in activities that involve standing. The point is to avoid being sedentary for long intervals of time.Use others as motivation. In the Tivity Health poll, 44% of responding seniors said they’re motivated to return to their fitness centers to see and socialize with friends. If you feel more motivated when not exercising all by yourself, you might optimize FaceTime, Zoom or even a quick phone call to interact with fitness-minded others as you work out at home.Check out local fitness centers. Before attending local gyms, learn what they’re doing to keep their customers safe and to align with recommended CDC guidelines. If you feel safe enough to participate, exercise in open spaces where you can maintain six feet of distance from others. You might also check out low-intensity options such as water exercise classes, yoga or Tai Chi.Whether you’re staying at home or practicing safe social distancing while out and about, there’s no need to give up the exercise that can help you maintain optimal health during the pandemic. Take steps now to ensure you’re taking good care of yourself through age-appropriate workouts and movement.To check your eligibility and find a health plan that includes SilverSneakers, visit silversneakers.com."

            "body": "As the world waits for the approval and release of a COVID-19 vaccine, many are learning about the historically lengthy and arduous procedures required to conduct clinical trials.For decades, the clinical trial process has remained largely untouched by new digital technologies, limiting the researchers and patients who could participate and slowing the development of new and effective therapies. However, as the digital revolution touches nearly every aspect of society, leveraging technology for clinical trials offers the opportunity to change the way we approach the development of new vaccines and therapies.In a world of social distancing and remote work, a new digital solution is seeking to revolutionize clinical trials as it continues to add researchers, providers and global pharmaceutical companies at an exponential rate. The Cognizant Shared Investigator Platform (SIP), launched in 2016 by the IT services giant together with the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies, offers a solution to the hurdles of legacy clinical trials at no cost to medical investigators.Speed and efficiencyUsing the latest digital technologies, automation and remote access services to connect investigators with clinical trial sponsors such as research universities and biopharmaceutical companies, this platform offers a new digital approach to improving the speed and efficiency of bringing new vaccines and therapies to the public.Until the development of digital solutions like SIP, the clinical trial process, developed in the 1940s, had been an administrative burden that led to more than half of all clinical investigators never participating in more than one clinical trial. Investigators cite the time required to implement clinical trials as an overwhelming challenge, and few independent investigators from small medical practices would even attempt a clinical trial.Today, much of that burden can be avoided through digital streamlining, eliminating redundant paperwork, reducing manual errors and expediting the rate at which clinical trials can get up and running on this SIP solution. In one example, a global biopharmaceutical company saw the time required for their regulatory submission process fall from 65 days to nine, allowing them to expedite their study by two months.Diverse patient populations As a result of digital clinical trial platforms like SIP, investigators are demonstrating a willingness to run multiple clinical trials, even outside of the United States — increasing the diversity of clinical trial participants. In fact, SIP has more than 110,000 users across 84 countries, of which thousands represent small clinical practices — an unprecedented number, and the number of users is doubling annually. It also allows investigators to adjust therapeutic protocols in real-time to reflect local conditions.Srinivas Shankar, Cognizant’s Global Head of Life Sciences who is in charge of SIP, said, “Providing access to a greater range of clinical practices increases the opportunity for more diverse patient populations to participate in clinical trials. Such increased diversity helps ensure that those populations most likely to take a specific medication are appropriately represented in studies prior to the drug’s launch.”Looking to the future and the need for speedy and safe therapies, sometimes in socially distant environments, “digital” appears to be the answer. In the case of the SIP solution, participating investigators found that their research was not disrupted by the pandemic — indeed, its use skyrocketed.Since the platform is entirely digital, allowing for greater remote collaboration, between April and August 2020 the platform saw a doubling in the number of active studies to nearly 1,200, and a 30% increase in the number of users over the same period. That means that despite the global impact of the pandemic, research has continued into a range of diseases, including cancers and chronic conditions.“The future may have uncertainty, but the opportunities provided to us through digital technology ensure our race toward cures will continue,” noted Shankar. “Our Shared Investigator Platform has an important role to play in the development of new vaccines and therapies. As we look to technology to both connect the world and improve the efficiency with which we work together, digital clinical trials open the door to global partnerships that could yield important developments in life sciences.”"

For those impacted by chronic, debilitating joint pain, this surgery isn’t truly elective — it can be essential to their quality of life.Sadly, those in need of joint replacement surgery have been without ideal options for relief in recent months, as they have waited for surgical regulations to ease in their state, or potentially because they are concerned about going to a hospital or surgical center during the pandemic.And while the pandemic has certainly complicated matters, even in “normal” times many people struggle with joint pain for years before moving forward with surgery. Some are afraid of the post-operative rehabilitation process while others hesitate because of the perceived commitment needed for post-operative physical therapy. This pain can have a significant impact on their quality of life; in a Gallup survey, 55% of adult joint replacement candidates said joint pain holds them back from leading a normal life through activities such as driving, participating in sports, exercising or activities with friends and family.[2]Why Further Delay Your Joint Replacement Surgery?The good news? Many local health authorities have allowed joint replacement surgeries to resume, so that patients can get relief from chronic, debilitating joint pain and improve their quality of life.[3] It's important to know that hospitals and outpatient surgery centers offering joint replacement surgery have implemented safety protocols and procedures to minimize risk of COVID-19.[4] Outpatient surgery centers may also offer additional peace of mind, as some patients can be discharged on the same day as their surgery and recover at home instead of spending additional time in the hospital.“The decision to move forward with a joint replacement surgery can be intimidating at any time, so it is understandable that people in need of these procedures may be hesitant to do so during COVID-19,' says Dr. Trevor Pickering, a reconstructive Orthopedic Surgery Specialist in Madison, MS. 'However, I want to encourage people suffering with joint pain to feel confident about moving forward with joint replacement during this time — there are a tremendous amount of protocols in place designed to keep you safe, and options for remote care with your physician to help you rehabilitate from home.'If you have chronic, debilitating pain, and you are among the many Americans who are considering scheduling or rescheduling a postponed joint replacement procedure, here are a few additional facts to consider:Whether you’ve put off your joint replacement surgery or haven’t yet scheduled, now is the time to take action to address your joint pain, so you can get back to enjoying your daily life.

Recommendations from the North American Cleaning and Sanitization Expert Panel, which recently convened in a workshop hosted by the University of Arizona, offer guidelines to help reduce the spread of infections and illness when it comes to laundry practices in your home. These methods can give you better peace of mind, knowing that you're doing all you can to help reduce the spread of viruses that cause COVID-19, the flu and colds.Here are some easy-to-follow do's and don'ts for laundry best practices in your home:DO use a deeper-cleaning, high-quality laundry detergent that removes deeply embedded soils and germs.According to one of the experts on the panel, microbiologist and University of Arizona professor Dr. Charles P. Gerba, regular good laundry practices, combined with the use of a deeper-cleaning, high-quality detergent and precautions like washing your hands after handling soiled or wet laundry is enough to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses.'Viruses that cause colds, flu and COVID-19 are very sensitive to the surfactants found in deeper-cleaning, high-quality laundry detergents,' said Dr. Gerba. 'Combined with the regular laundry process and special handling precautions including hand washing, deeper-cleaning detergents can provide better protection for you and your family versus the use of lighter cleaning detergents.'DO always wash or sanitize hands after handling soiled laundry and transferring wet laundry from washer to dryer, even in healthy households.DO use special precautions if COVID-19, the flu, or a cold is suspected or confirmed. Wear disposable gloves if possible when handling dirty laundry (clothes and linens) from a person who is sick. Dirty laundry from a person who is sick can be washed with other people’s items. Do not shake dirty laundry. Clean and disinfect clothes hampers, appliance and other surfaces that contact soiled laundry. Remove gloves, and wash or sanitize hands right away. Wash or sanitize hands again after transferring wet laundry from washer to dryer.DO frequently wash clothing and other items such as bath towels, hand towels and kitchen towels. Bedsheets and especially pillowcases also require frequent laundering.DO use the highest temperature clothes washer setting you can safely use, according to the care instructions for the items being laundered if a respiratory illness such as COVID-19, the flu or a cold is suspected or confirmed. Healthy households can wash clothes in cold water.DO regularly clean and disinfect your home's clothes hampers, appliances or other surfaces that come into contact with soiled laundry.DON'T use a laundry sanitizer for everyday cleaning. Laundry sanitizers are an added extra step needed during specific illnesses, such as the stomach flu, and are not needed to protect you and your family against the viruses that cause colds, the flu, and COVID-19. In special situations where a laundry sanitizer is recommended for use, it should always be used after washing with a deeper-cleaning laundry detergent.DON'T wait to wash soiled clothes or bedding of an ill family member — wash those items as soon as possible to avoid spreading infection in your household.DON'T wash bedding or clothes from a family member who is ill with an enteric virus (stomach bug, vomiting and diarrhea), has a weakened immune system, or work clothes contaminated by germs from sick people or animals together with laundry from other members of the household. Keeping that laundry separate can help prevent viruses or bacteria from spreading to others. Wash in hot water, using a deeper-cleaning laundry detergent plus a registered sanitizer and/or sanitizing cycle on the washing machine. Dry in a dryer on high heat. Wearing disposable gloves when handling soiled laundry from an ill household member can provide an extra layer of protection.Following these laundry practices can help ensure your family will be less likely to spread bacteria or viruses, says Dr. Gerba, helping to reduce the risk of illness for everyone in your home.Learn more about good laundry and cleaning practices as recommended by the North American Cleaning and Sanitization Expert Panel by visiting News.Arizona.edu/story/dirt-laundry-and-how-reduce-your-risk-getting-sick."

            "body": "David founded a multimillion-dollar brokerage firm, managed 75 employees, and was happily married. At age 39, David was prescribed opioids to manage pain from several knee surgeries. Although David had a history of excessive alcohol and cocaine use and had even completed treatment for substance use, he wasn’t aware of the addictive properties of prescription opioids.In a matter of weeks, David found himself taking far more opioids than he was prescribed. When David could no longer get a prescription for opioids, he turned to heroin, and from there his life spiraled out of control. He bankrupted his brokerage firm, lost his wife to divorce, and was sentenced to five years in federal prison.David isn’t alone.While she was pregnant, Tessa misused prescription opioids and took illicit drugs to self-medicate her chronic headaches, pain from fibromyalgia, and depression. Britton became addicted after taking opioids prescribed by his doctor at age 19 after sustaining a severe shoulder injury while serving in the U.S. Army. Tele misused prescription opioids beginning at age 13 because he experienced anxiety and depression. Alaska Natives Jeni and Stevi Rae, suffering from intergenerational trauma, also became addicted to prescription opioids.Opioid use disorder and prescription opioid overdose can impact anyoneOpioids are prescribed to treat pain, often following surgery or injury, or for health conditions. But opioids carry serious risks. In 2018 alone, overdoses involving opioids killed nearly 47,000 people — and 32% of those deaths involved prescription opioids. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s National Survey on Drug Use and Health, an estimated 10.1 million people aged 12 and older reported misusing opioids in 2019 and an estimated 1.6 million people suffered from opioid use disorder.Recovery is possible, treatment can helpIn addition to having a history of suffering from opioid use disorder, David, Britton, Tessa, Tele, Jeni, Stevi Rae and many others have something else in common — they have all recovered.David has been in recovery for nine years and is dedicated to working as an interventionist and certified recovery coach. He also helped champion funding for local prevention, education, and treatment efforts in Minnesota.Tessa has been in recovery for three years and runs a treatment center focused on supporting pregnant women with substance use disorders. For Britton, a structured therapy program helped him get into and stay in recovery. Tele has been in recovery for four years and credits his parents and friends for supporting him. Jeni and Stevi Rae both credit their recoveries to connecting with their culture, despite the limited resources in their community.Raising awareness in communities The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Rx Awareness campaign aims to prevent prescription opioid overdose and reinforce the message that recovery is possible for people who are struggling. The campaign is designed to raise awareness that prescription opioids can be addictive and dangerous. The campaign features stories from real people about how prescription opioids impacted their lives.Anyone who is prescribed opioids can become addicted to them and taking too much can result in an overdose. “This started as a problem linked to prescription opioids in some parts of America, but now it’s an ‘everyone, everywhere’ problem,” said Grant Baldwin, Ph.D., M.P.H., director of CDC’s Division of Overdose Prevention. “Rx Awareness is focused on preventing overdoses from happening in the first place and partnering with communities to increase awareness and save lives. It’s just unacceptable for anyone to die of a drug overdose. It should never happen.”Visit https://findtreatment.gov/ to learn more about available treatment options.

Alaska Natives <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/rxawareness/stories/jeni.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Jeni</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/rxawareness/stories/stevirae.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Stevi Rae</a>, suffering from intergenerational trauma, also became addicted to prescription opioids.</p><p><strong>Opioid use disorder and prescription opioid overdose can impact anyone</strong></p><p>Opioids are prescribed to treat pain, often following surgery or injury, or for health conditions. But opioids carry serious risks. In 2018 alone, overdoses involving opioids killed nearly 47,000 people — and 32% of those deaths involved prescription opioids. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s National Survey on Drug Use and Health, an estimated 10.1 million people aged 12 and older reported misusing opioids in 2019 and an estimated 1.6 million people suffered from opioid use disorder.</p><p><strong>Recovery is possible, treatment can help</strong></p><p>In addition to having a history of suffering from opioid use disorder, David, Britton, Tessa, Tele, Jeni, Stevi Rae and many others have something else in common — they have all recovered.</p><p>David has been in recovery for nine years and is dedicated to working as an interventionist and certified recovery coach. He also helped champion funding for local prevention, education, and treatment efforts in Minnesota.</p><p>Tessa has been in recovery for three years and runs a treatment center focused on supporting pregnant women with substance use disorders. For Britton, a structured therapy program helped him get into and stay in recovery. Tele has been in recovery for four years and credits his parents and friends for supporting him. Jeni and Stevi Rae both credit their recoveries to connecting with their culture, despite the limited resources in their community.</p><p><strong>Raising awareness in communities </strong></p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) <em>Rx Awareness</em> campaign aims to prevent prescription opioid overdose and reinforce the message that recovery is possible for people who are struggling. The campaign is designed to raise awareness that prescription opioids can be addictive and dangerous. The campaign features stories from real people about how prescription opioids impacted their lives.</p><p>Anyone who is prescribed opioids can become addicted to them and taking too much can result in an overdose. “This started as a problem linked to prescription opioids in some parts of America, but now it’s an ‘everyone, everywhere’ problem,” said Grant Baldwin, Ph.D., M.P.H., director of CDC’s Division of Overdose Prevention. “<em>Rx Awareness</em> is focused on preventing overdoses from happening in the first place and partnering with communities to increase awareness and save lives. It’s just unacceptable for anyone to die of a drug overdose. It should never happen.”</p><p>Visit <a href=\"https://findtreatment.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">https://findtreatment.gov/</a> to learn more about available treatment options. <strong>For more information about the <em>Rx Awareness </em>campaign and resources about prevention and recovery, visit: </strong><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/rxawareness/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><strong>www.cdc.gov/rxawareness</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>",

What if my kids have trouble getting back to in-person learning? It's an anxious time for many parents.In fact, a recent Understood/YouGov survey of 2,000 parents of 5- to 17-year-olds, shows that 71% are worried that their children will face challenges this year. For parents of kids who are diagnosed with or show signs of learning and thinking differences, that number is 79%. And nearly half (48%) of all parents are worried about their child being left behind because of the 'COVID slide.'The shutdowns last spring gave parents a window into their children's learning and behavior. And for some, it raised new questions — and concerns. Questions like:Nearly four in 10 (37%) parents surveyed by Understood have noticed new or different behaviors in their child during the pandemic. Trying to make sense of challenges or differences isn't always easy. But getting answers allows parents and professionals to get kids support at early as possible.'Every child is unique, so it's difficult for caregivers to know which behaviors are normal for their age and which might be flags that something else is going on,' says Bob Cunningham, executive director of learning development for social impact organization Understood. 'Families are spending more time together and some may have started to notice things they didn't before. The good news is there are some easy steps they can take.'What are learning and thinking differencesKids develop at different rates, so it can be hard for families to interpret what they're seeing. Some of these struggles can also be a sign of learning and thinking differences like dyslexia, ADHD and dyscalculia (a learning disability in math).At least 15 million children in the United States — one in five — learn or think differently. They may struggle with different skills, including reading, writing, math, focus and following directions. Sometimes those challenges are obvious, but other times the signs can be confusing. For example, difficulty with spelling can be a sign of a reading challenge. Not being able to tell time might be a problem with math.Because the signs of learning and thinking differences aren't always clear, Understood developed a free tool called Take N.O.T.E. in partnership with the American Academy of Pediatrics. It's designed to guide families to get answers about what they are seeing in their child.4 steps to start finding answersThe Take N.O.T.E. tool centers on a simple four-step process:• Notice if there’s something going on with your child that’s out of the ordinary.• Observe and keep track of patterns in your child’s behavior.• Talk to your child, teachers, aides and caregivers about what you’re observing.• Engage with trusted professionals, like pediatricians.'Not knowing what different behaviors or struggles mean or how to help can feel stressful and overwhelming for parents and caregivers,' says Cunningham.

            "body": "This year alone an estimated 276,000 women and 2,620 men in the United States will be diagnosed with breast cancer. While breast cancer continues to impact a significant number of people each year, scientific advancements have led to more personalized treatment options. Researchers have developed a greater understanding about the role that genes and defects in these genes, called mutations, can play in cancer development as well as help inform treatment decisions. Here’s what you need to know.What is biomarker testing? Just as each person’s fingerprint is unique, breast cancer is different for every patient. Each breast cancer tumor has its own unique characteristics, including the presence of biomarkers.Scientists and medical professionals can better understand a patient’s unique type of breast cancer with tests to detect specific biomarkers in tumors. Biomarker testing can be done by collecting tissue samples from a cancer tumor during a surgical procedure called a biopsy. Cancer cells are then analyzed in a lab to identify the biomarkers.Biomarker testing can be done as soon as a patient is diagnosed with cancer. Medical organizations recommend patients undergo biomarker testing as early as possible, as it will help doctors determine a treatment plan and the best course of care.Treatment plans based on biomarker testing may include innovative medicines called targeted therapies, which are designed to target specific biomarkers in an individual tumor. Understanding more about the characteristics of a person’s tumor through biomarker testing can help doctors identify appropriate therapy options, including personalized treatments. If you have been diagnosed with breast cancer, it’s important to talk to your doctor about biomarker testing and how the results may inform your treatment decisions and family cancer risk.What genes are important in breast cancer? Breast cancer can be influenced by genetics and may be passed on from parent to child. In some cases, inherited mutations in certain genes can mean a higher risk of developing breast cancer. For those at risk of inherited mutations, genetic testing, using either blood or saliva, is used to determine a person’s future risk for breast and other cancers. For people who have already received a breast cancer diagnosis, genetic testing may provide additional information with regard to treatment options.The most commonly detected gene mutations associated with breast cancer are in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. BRCA stands for BReast CAncer susceptibility gene. Normally, BRCA genes prevent tumors from growing by repairing damaged DNA. When a BRCA mutation is present, these genes may not work the way they are supposed to, and as a result, cells may grow and divide to form a tumor.Immediate family members of a person who tests positive for an inherited mutation should consider genetic testing. There is a 50% chance that a first-degree relative may also have the genetic mutation. Anyone who is concerned about their risk should speak to their doctor or a genetic counselor about whether genetic testing is right for them.Where to find supportA breast cancer diagnosis can be frightening and confusing. It’s important for people with breast cancer to find resources and support to learn about their disease and to feel empowered to take an active role in fighting their cancer. There are a wide variety of services available at the national and local levels to help with everything from finding a support group to caregiver services and finding rides to medical appointments.It can be particularly helpful to share experiences and get advice from others who have experienced breast cancer. Support groups can offer a safe forum to exchange perspectives, concerns and information to help patients navigate the challenges they may face living with cancer. Peer support can also give patients the tools to have better, more productive conversations with their health providers. Importantly, finding the right support can help patients feel less alone in their journey.For more information about BRCA gene mutations and breast cancer, visit https://www.bebrcaware.com."

            "author": "BrandPoint",

            "body": "If you lost a loved one during the pandemic, you were likely unable to hold the kind of memorial service you would have wanted to honor that special person. Funeral services are an essential part of the grieving process and help bring closure during some of life’s darkest moments. Thousands of families who suffered a loss during COVID-19 have opted to hold a memorial at a later date. This Celebration of Remembrance can be held at any time and at the place of your choosing. Here are four tips to help you plan the celebration that your loved one deserves, with every detail remembered.1. Choose a dateThe first step is to pencil in a date. While your loved one may already be laid to rest, perhaps there’s a special time approaching that might be perfect for a meaningful remembrance — for example, a birthday, anniversary or your loved one’s favorite time of year. Once you’ve decided on a date, time and location, communicate these details to friends and family so they can make plans to attend and celebrate your loved one.2. Get help from a funeral plannerFuneral professionals are experts at helping you plan a celebration of life to remember the extraordinary life of a parent, grandparent, spouse or someone else important to you. They’ll ask detailed questions to understand your loved one's hobbies, profession, cherished memories and how they would have liked to be honored. From there, you can build a theme that will incorporate and capture all the details of your loved one, paying tribute to the legacy they have left behind.3. Plan a themeGather photos, prized possessions, video clips and more that will showcase the person you loved and what made their days special and unique. You can also include music, flowers or a special meal. What were their joys, their passions and their favorite traditions? Plan to weave all these details together to tell their life story.

            "html": "<p>If you lost a loved one during the pandemic, you were likely unable to hold the kind of memorial service you would have wanted to honor that special person. Funeral services are an essential part of the grieving process and help bring closure during some of life’s darkest moments. Thousands of families who suffered a loss during COVID-19 have opted to hold a memorial at a later date. This <a href=\"https://www.dignitymemorial.com/celebration-of-life/after-covid/remember-a-loved-one?utm_campaign=article\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Celebration of Remembrance</a> can be held at any time and at the place of your choosing. Here are four tips to help you plan the celebration that your loved one deserves, with every detail remembered.</p><p>1. Choose a date</p><p>The first step is to pencil in a date. While your loved one may already be laid to rest, perhaps there’s a special time approaching that might be perfect for a meaningful remembrance — for example, a birthday, anniversary or your loved one’s favorite time of year.

Get help from a funeral planner</p><p>Funeral professionals are experts at helping you <a href=\"https://www.dignitymemorial.com/celebration-of-life/how-to-plan?utm_campaign=article\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">plan a celebration of life</a> to remember the extraordinary life of a parent, grandparent, spouse or someone else important to you. They’ll ask detailed questions to understand your loved one's hobbies, profession, cherished memories and how they would have liked to be honored. From there, you can build a theme that will incorporate and capture all the details of your loved one, paying tribute to the legacy they have left behind.</p><p>3. Plan a theme</p><p>Gather photos, prized possessions, video clips and more that will showcase the person you loved and what made their days special and unique. You can also include music, flowers or a special meal. What were their joys, their passions and their favorite traditions? Plan to weave all these details together to tell their life story.

            "body": "As our country grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic, a potentially dangerous season is beginning: flu season. The threat of the pandemic will become more complicated by increasing cases of the flu, making more people ill and putting further strain on the U.S. health care system.Pediatric epidemiologist and infectious disease specialist Dr. Emily Godbout, DO, MPH, from Children’s Hospital of Richmond at VCU offers five crucial reasons everyone should get a flu shot this year.1. Flu shots help reduce serious respiratory illness While some people who get vaccinated may still contract influenza, the flu shot typically prevents about 70 of 100 people who receive it from developing a moderate to severe flu infection. So even though the vaccine might not completely prevent the flu, it can help keep you from getting sick enough that you have to go to the hospital.“Reducing the overall burden of respiratory illnesses is really important to help protect vulnerable populations at risk for severe disease,” says Dr. Godbout, “And it also helps lessen the resulting burden on our health care system, which is crucial throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.”Godbout adds that while practices people follow to help guard against COVID-19, such as handwashing, social distancing and wearing masks, will probably help decrease the spread of influenza, the flu shot is still the single most effective way to reduce the spread of the flu.2. Flu shots are safe“The flu shot is very safe and effective at helping prevent severe disease and hospitalization,” Godbout confirms. “I know people might have reservations about coming into the doctor’s office, but I can assure everyone that our providers are really vigilant about taking appropriate precautions to make sure everyone is safe.”The doctor also reassures patients that they will not contract influenza from the vaccine. “The virus is inactivated,” she explains, “so it can’t actually cause the flu infection after you get the shot.”Flu shots are recommended for anyone six months old and older.3. Flu shots are updated every year “The U.S. flu vaccine is reviewed every single year and updated to match circulating flu viruses,” explains Dr. Godbout. “The flu vaccine can typically protect against three or four different viruses. Since the virus changes from year to year, immunization or natural infection from the previous year is not protective.'She also stresses that our antibody response — what helps us fight the virus — can decrease over time, so a yearly dose will help boost the antibody response before the start of the influenza season.4. Influenza and COVID-19 share some overlapping symptomsIt’s important to know that some symptoms of COVID-19 and influenza are similar. If you have symptoms you are concerned about, it’s best to call your health care provider right away. You may need to be tested for both the flu and COVID-19 to be certain what is causing you to be sick, so your doctor can recommend the best course of treatment.While having the flu shot doesn't mean you can't get the flu, as discussed above, a vaccination will at least lessen the severity of your symptoms — giving you and your loved ones peace of mind.Reducing the spread of flu cases overall, by getting vaccinated, will help cut down on the number of seriously ill patients that clinics and hospitals need to diagnose and treat, which will help everyone get through the winter season more easily.5. A flu shot protects you throughout the seasonNow is the best time to get vaccinated, as it takes a couple of weeks for antibodies to develop in your body. The vaccination will continue to protect you throughout the worst months of the flu season.“It’s a great idea to get the flu shot right before flu season, so September and October are really good times to get vaccinated,” Godbout recommends. 'We will continue to offer the flu shot throughout the fall and winter, but ideally we want to see people get it by the end of October.”For the latest on flu and COVID-19 visit vcuhealth.org."

If you’re one of them, a new video series featuring Mark Bittman, author of “How to Cook Everything,” provides an exciting new resource.Over the next few months, the “Cooking in Your True to Food Kitchen” series will explore a range of cooking modalities and doable gourmet recipes, offering today’s “Technicurean” home chefs inspiration for elevating everyday fare.Bittman partners with executive chef Nick Ritchie from Signature Kitchen Suite’s Experience &amp; Design Center in culinary-centric Napa Valley, Calif., to showcase delicious, healthy recipes that bring restaurant-quality meals right into your home.Pro cooking tipsHere are some of Bittman’s tips to consider when cooking:Restaurant-quality recipes Next, try out one of Bittman’s signature recipes, featured in the first video of the series.Herb Seasoned FishIngredients4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil or butter 1 tablespoon minced onion (or garlic, ginger, shallots, scallions or lemongrass) 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice or balsamic vinegar SaltFreshly ground black pepper 1/2-1 cup chopped mixed fresh herbs (like parsley, basil, tarragon, rosemary, chives, marjoram or sage — use smaller amount for stronger herbs) 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil About 1 1/2 pounds large fish fillets (monkfish, halibut or tuna) 1 cup chicken, fish or vegetable stock (more if needed)DirectionsHeat oven to 450 F. Mix herbs with salt and pepper. Heat large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat about 2 minutes; add olive oil. When it’s good and hot, dredge fish in the herb mixture. Brown for couple minutes on both sides. Add liquid to pan and put uncovered in oven. Roast until fish is tender, 20-30 minutes, turning once or twice (1-inch thick steaks of most fish will take 5-10 minutes less). Regardless of thickness, fillet will still be firm and juicy when done but will be opaque inside; a thin-bladed knife will pass through fairly easily.To make “five-minute drizzle sauce,” put oil or butter in saucepan over medium heat. When oil is warm or butter is melted, add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened (turn heat down if it starts to color), 1-2 minutes. Stir in 2 tablespoons water and lemon juice and sprinkle with salt and pepper; maintain heat so it bubbles gently for 1-2 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning.Transfer fish to warm platter. If pan juices are thin, reduce a bit; if they’re too thick, add a little more stock and cook over medium heat for a minute or two. Serve fish with drizzle sauce spooned over it.Upgrade your kitchen to boost your resultsTo make recipes shine, Bittman advises at-home chefs to upgrade the tools and equipment — especially appliances and other must-haves they use every day. He recommends today’s ultra-versatile appliances, like those from Signature Kitchen Suite, which feature multiple modalities — from steam and gas to induction and even industry-first sous vide built right into the cooktop — to deliver elevated creations and make your cooking experience easier and more successful, night after night. The investment in pro-quality equipment leads to better results, wherever you are in your culinary journey, according to Bittman."

            "body": "Cold and flu season, combined with an ongoing pandemic, is motivating many Americans to do everything possible to support immune health. Fortunately, simple lifestyle habits, like a healthy diet, can make a big difference in strengthening the body’s defense system. But what foods are best — and why?When it comes to immune-boosting foods, most people immediately turn to orange juice for a quick fix of vitamin C. “While it is true that citrus fruit helps support the immune system, there are many other foods that offer an impressive profile of nutrients believed to maintain strong immunity,” says registered dietitian Sheri Kasper. Here are three surprising, dietitian-recommended foods that can help ward off illness this cold and flu season.1. Farmed salmonFarmed salmon offers outstanding nutrition that can help protect against everything from heart disease to depression. Specifically, farmed salmon supports the immune system thanks to two key nutrients that are uncommon in many other foods: vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids. While vitamin D is often connected to bone health, emerging research out of Boston University suggests that it may also be vital to proper immune function. Few foods are naturally high in vitamin D, but a serving of farmed salmon offers nearly one-third of daily recommended needs. Omega-3 fatty acids, abundantly found in farmed salmon, are highly anti-inflammatory and support the immune system by reducing chronic inflammation. Kasper recommends choosing farmed salmon from Chile because it is sustainably raised, high in omega-3 fats and does not contain antibiotics or mercury.2. YogurtYogurt and other fermented foods contain healthy bacteria called probiotics. Probiotics are well-known for supporting digestive or “gut” health by preventing overgrowth of bad bacteria. But maintaining a healthy balance of good and bad bacteria in the gut is also believed to boost the immune system. “Most people do not realize that about 70 percent of your body’s immune system is in your gut,” says Kasper. In addition to containing probiotics, yogurt is also one of the few foods that is almost always fortified with vitamin D, which offers additional immune support. Look for yogurt labeled as containing “Live and Active Cultures” and steer clear of yogurt that contains a lot of added sugar. Try plain yogurt and sweeten by adding fresh fruit and a small drizzle of honey.3. Red bell peppersRed bell peppers are rich in vitamins and antioxidants that support the immune system. One example is vitamin C, which encourages the production of the white blood cells that are responsible for defending the body against pathogens. Red bell peppers contain almost three times more vitamin C than oranges. They are also loaded with vitamin A and the antioxidant beta-carotene, which can be converted to vitamin A in the body, when needed. Vitamin A is important in maintaining the natural mucus barriers located in the eyes, gut and other parts of the body. These barriers are designed to trap bacteria and are essential to optimal immunity. Be sure to choose red peppers because they have significantly more vitamin A, vitamin C and beta-carotene compared to green bell peppers.While a healthy diet cannot prevent seasonal colds, the flu or other viral illnesses, a combination of the right foods, plenty of sleep, regular exercise and a balanced lifestyle will arm your body’s defenses and may help minimize the length and severity of illness.

Yet only about 40% of those individuals ever seek help.Service dogs are proving to help military veterans suffering from PTSD and other post-combat challenges in ways that no other therapy can. Unfortunately, due to the cost and time it takes to train a service dog, less than 1% of those in need can obtain one. Dog Chow is on a mission to help change that with its Service Dog Salute campaign, which supports the care and training of more service dogs for America’s military veterans.If you’re looking for ways to support veterans in your community and across the country, here are four ways you can help.1. Get informed.Receiving a service dog can be life-changing for veterans. More than just companions, psychiatric service dogs are specially trained to help veterans live an improved quality of life. They can help ease stress and soothe anxiety through specific tasks like interrupting night terrors, calming panic attacks, reminding a veteran to take medication, providing security and more.In fact, veterans who utilize service dogs report lower levels of depression and anxiety, fewer hospitalizations and a reduction in medical and psychiatric costs, among other benefits. This is particularly beneficial for those who struggle with PTSD.Contrary to what many believe, PTSD service dogs are not the same as emotional support, therapy or companion dogs. Like service dogs for the blind, deaf and physically disabled, PTSD service dogs for veterans must be specifically trained to help their handler perform tasks they cannot otherwise perform on their own.2. Buy a bag of Purina Dog ChowThrough its Service Dog Salute program, Purina Dog Chow is supporting the care and training of more service dogs for veterans, so that every military hero in need can find a canine hero of their own. From Sept. 1, 2020, through Thanksgiving (Nov. 26, 2020), for every purchase of a specially marked bag of Purina Dog Chow, Purina will make a donation to its two partnering service dog organizations (up to a total of $100,000). The donations will be split equally between the Pets &amp; Vets program at Tony La Russa’s Animal Rescue Foundation and Got Your Six Support Dogs.Over the last three years, Purina Dog Chow has donated over $700,000 to support the training of service dogs for military veterans. If you or a veteran you know could benefit from a service dog, or to learn more, visit DogChow.com/service.3. Support veteran service dog organizationsIt takes on average between one and two and a half years and $25,000 to train and place one service dog. These costs include specialized training, food, veterinarian services, veteran therapy expenses and more. Especially now, as fundraisers and other events continue to be cancelled, non-profit organizations that serve our nation’s veterans need help more than ever. Donating directly to your local nonprofits will help them continue their missions to help these men and women regain their lives through the healing power of dogs.4. Support legislationMen and women returning from service suffer from invisible as well as physical wounds. Congress can give veterans the opportunity to utilize the treatments that work best for them. The PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act (HR4305) will create a pilot program in the VA to give veterans access to treatment derived from working with service dogs. The bill would change the existing Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) policy to recognize service dogs as a treatment option for PTSD, as well as create a program within the VA allowing veterans to train service dogs for their personal use or for other veterans facing physical disabilities.The bill has been approved by the House, but still awaits passage in the Senate. To support this legislation, visit dogchow.com/service to send an email to your state senators urging them to pass the bill."

            "body": "Addiction is a chronic but treatable medical condition. Often unintentionally, many people still talk about addiction in ways that are stigmatizing—meaning they use words that can portray someone with a substance use disorder in a shameful way, which may discourage them from seeking treatment. To reduce harmful stigma and negativity around substance use disorders and encourage people to obtain the help they need, it is essential to change the way society views addiction. The first step is to understand why this stigma exists, and how we all can help to remove it.What is stigma?Stigma can be defined as an attribute that is deeply discrediting, reducing the bearer from a whole and usual person to a tainted, discounted one. Stigma about people with substance use disorders might include inaccurate or unfounded beliefs that they are dangerous, incapable of managing treatment, or at fault for their condition.Where does stigma come from?Stigma around addiction may come from old and inaccurate ideas, or fear of things that are different or misunderstood. Research has shown that public attitudes and beliefs about addiction are also affected by how it is presented in the media. For example, TV shows and movies often portray characters with substance use disorders negatively. These depictions can increase fear, pity and even anger toward people with substance use disorders.In addition, people with substance use disorders may feel ashamed of their addiction and their difficulty in stopping drugs or alcohol. This may discourage them from reaching out to others or seeking treatment.The truth about addictionAddiction was once considered to be due to a weakness in a person’s character. But decades of scientific research have demonstrated that addiction is not a choice. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, it is a brain disorder that involves functional changes to brain circuits involved in reward, stress, and self-control. These brain changes can make it extraordinarily difficult for a person to resist the urge to continue using drugs, even if their drug use is causing problems at home, work, or school. The good news is that treatment can help set the brain on a path to recovery.Addiction is a lot like other diseases, such as type 2 diabetes. Both disrupt the normal, healthy functioning of the body, both have serious harmful effects for those affected, both are influenced by the environments the person lives in and both are, in many cases, preventable and treatable. If left untreated, they can get worse and may lead to disabilities and death. Just like with many other health conditions, people with substance use disorders can recover and continue to lead healthy lives with the appropriate support.A number of factors, most of them outside of one’s control, make people more vulnerable to addiction. These factors include genetics and family history, the environment in which they grew up, trauma or co-occurring mental health issues, and many other social and behavioral factors. Ultimately, addiction doesn’t discriminate. It can impact people of all ages, races, genders, and social classes.How can we overcome stigma? Reducing stigma and helping people achieve their best health outcomes starts with each of us. By paying attention to our own attitudes and beliefs about addiction, we can consciously begin to replace any fears and judgments with respect and compassion.To start, making simple changes in language can help reduce harmful negativity around substance use disorders. When talking to or about people with substance use disorders, consider using person-first language, which focuses on the person—not their illness. This includes removing words that define a person by their condition or may have negative connotations. For example, “a person with a substance use disorder” has a neutral tone and separates the person from his or her disorder. Someone who is working to overcome drug use can be described as a “person in recovery.”Importantly, check in with friends or loved ones about how they refer to themselves and how they would like others to refer to them. This can be one step toward opening up a dialogue from which to learn about each other and offer compassion and support.We can also educate ourselves on the facts about addiction. It’s important to seek science-based information from a trustworthy source. And we can share that information with others to help them overcome their own misperceptions about addiction.Learn more about how drug use and addiction affect the brain at www.drugabuse.gov."

            "body": "Glaucoma. It’s a sneaky disease that usually strikes without warning. More than three million people in the United States have it — but only half know they do. Left untreated, glaucoma can lead to progressive vision loss and irreversible blindness. While a diagnosis of glaucoma can be scary, much has been learned about the disease and how to manage it over the past two decades.“Managing glaucoma starts with early detection and treatment, which is critical to preventing or slowing vision loss,” says Ruth D. Williams, MD, a glaucoma specialist at the Wheaton (IL) Eye Clinic and host of the Glaucoma Research Foundation’s upcoming Glaucoma Patient Summit. “Therefore, it’s important for people to understand all they can about this disease. Reducing fears and improving outcomes in glaucoma start with knowing the facts.”Busting the myths about glaucomaApproximately 90% of people with glaucoma have a form called open-angle glaucoma, which typically has no symptoms that serve as red flags. Open-angle glaucoma develops slowly and sometimes without noticeable sight loss for many years. Recognizing misconceptions about the disease can make you less vulnerable to it. Take a look at these top 5 myths about glaucoma, along with the straight facts.1. Glaucoma is an “elderly person’s” disease Though it is most prevalent in people over age 60, glaucoma strikes people of all ages — from infants to the elderly. In fact, about 1 in 10,000 babies are born with the disease. Additionally, African Americans are at higher risk of developing glaucoma at a younger age.2. Good vision means you don’t have and cannot get glaucomaPerhaps the scariest aspect of glaucoma is its lack of early warning signs, particularly with open-angle glaucoma, where vision change is often gradual and peripheral vision is affected first. Even if you have the best of vision, you still could have increased intraocular eye pressure or other glaucoma risk factors that are only detectable with annual eye exams.3. Family history is the only risk factorIf no one in your family has glaucoma, it doesn’t necessarily mean you won’t develop the disease. While family history is one risk factor, there are many others. The bottom line is that anyone could develop glaucoma.4. Glaucoma symptoms are consistent and easy to noticeGlaucoma is a group of blindness-causing diseases and has several forms, each with varying symptoms. The two most prevalent forms — open-angle glaucoma and angle-closure glaucoma — do not show up in the same ways. As mentioned, open-angle glaucoma does not become noticeable until it has caused significant vision loss. On the other hand, angle-closure glaucoma is a much rarer form and has symptoms, such as headache, nausea and hazy vision, that develop very quickly.5. Blindness is inevitableThe vast majority of people who are diagnosed with glaucoma when they are not yet blind never go blind. If you are diagnosed with glaucoma, you can increase your chances of maintaining sight and enjoying a full and healthy life by seeing your eye care professional regularly and following your prescribed treatment regimen.Annual Summit brings patients togetherTo help patients diagnosed with glaucoma and their loved ones better understand the disease and the latest progress against it, the Glaucoma Research Foundation will host its second annual Glaucoma Patient Summit on Saturday, Nov. 7, 2020. This year’s gathering is a virtual event due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Hosted by Dr. Williams, the event will highlight advances in treatment options and offer practical information to help patients understand and live with glaucoma. Speakers include leading glaucoma specialists, patients and caregivers. Tickets are available at www.glaucoma.org/patient."

            "summary": "",
            "body": "When Alejandra Marquez was 12 years old, she suddenly started to scream during an otherwise typical Sunday church service. There was a loud buzzing that only she could hear, and she soon began to have trouble standing.“It sounded like a mosquito loudly humming in my ear,” Marquez said. “It was a terrifying first episode, and I’ll never forget it.”Her parents called a local doctor, who told them that Marquez immediately needed sugar. She drank a soda as her father drove her to the emergency room.A week prior to this incident, Marquez had been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, but she and her parents were unprepared for the potential dangers of hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar.What is hypoglycemia? Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, is a potentially dangerous condition that occurs when a person’s blood sugar (glucose) levels fall low enough that they need to take immediate action. For people with diabetes, low blood sugar usually happens when blood sugar levels fall below 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), though some people have symptoms of low blood sugar at higher levels.“Low blood sugar is most common for people with diabetes, especially those who take medications that increase insulin levels or otherwise lower blood sugar levels,” said Javier Morales, M.D., an endocrinologist and spokesperson for the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE). “Everyone with diabetes, as well as their friends and families, should be familiar with this condition and be prepared.”Low blood sugar causes approximately 100,000 emergency room visits per year in the U.S. The potential risk of a low blood sugar emergency can take an emotional toll on people living with diabetes, disrupting day-to-day tasks. A third of adults with diabetes worry about driving safely because of possible low blood sugar episodes.Get the lowdown on low blood sugarMarquez has lived with Type 1 diabetes for over two decades and has experienced several low blood sugar emergencies since her first episode as a child. As an adult, she regularly volunteers with DiabetesSisters, a U.S. nonprofit that aims to improve the quality of life for women with diabetes and for those at risk.“On that Sunday when I experienced low blood sugar for the first time, I remember that I’d skipped breakfast,” Marquez said. “I had also just begun diabetes treatment. Part of being prepared for a low blood sugar episode is knowing these types of risks, as well as possible signals that your blood sugar is low, so you can act quickly.”Risk factors for low blood sugar include taking certain diabetes medications, eating less than usual, age, excessive alcohol consumption and increased exercise without enough nutrition. Symptoms can be mild, such as dizziness or unusual irritability, or more severe and life-threatening, such as seizures. Some people with milder symptoms may have episodes that go unnoticed, while others might have more serious symptoms and need family members or their support circles to be prepared to help.Be prepared for a low blood sugar emergencyPeople with diabetes should speak to an endocrinologist (a physician who specializes in hormones and metabolism) about blood glucose targets, treatment options and how to prepare for a potential blood sugar emergency, and then share this plan with those close to them.“It’s vital for people at risk to prepare for an emergency, but it’s also important that friends and family know how to act if needed,” Morales said. “It’s possible for someone with severe low blood sugar to become confused or unconscious, so people who are often around you also need to know the steps to take.”For milder emergencies, Morales advises people to follow the Rule of 15, which involves eating 15 grams of carbohydrates or simple sugars and then rechecking blood sugar levels after 15 minutes. If blood sugar is still low, the person should have another serving. Once blood sugar levels are back to normal, they can eat a meal or snack to make sure it doesn’t lower again.For severe emergencies, a person may need to administer emergency hypoglycemia rescue therapy, which contains an up-to-date prescription of glucagon in any delivery format (e.g., injection or nasal spray). Insulin should not be injected, as it will lower a person's blood sugar even more.People in an emergency situation or those assisting them should also seek medical care or call for medical assistance, if needed. Be sure to tell the emergency dispatcher if a person has diabetes and may be experiencing severe low blood sugar.Learn more about hypoglycemia and preparing for an emergency at bloodsugarlows.com.Support for bloodsugarlows.com is provided by Eli Lilly and Company, Zealand Pharmaceuticals, NovoNordisk, Sanofi and Medtronic."

            "html": "<p>When Alejandra Marquez was 12 years old, she suddenly started to scream during an otherwise typical Sunday church service. There was a loud buzzing that only she could hear, and she soon began to have trouble standing.</p><p>“It sounded like a mosquito loudly humming in my ear,” Marquez said. “It was a terrifying first episode, and I’ll never forget it.”</p><p>Her parents called a local doctor, who told them that Marquez immediately needed sugar. She drank a soda as her father drove her to the emergency room.</p><p>A week prior to this incident, Marquez had been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, but she and her parents were unprepared for the potential dangers of hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar.</p><p><strong><em>What is hypoglycemia? </em></strong></p><p>Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, is a potentially dangerous condition that occurs when a person’s blood sugar (glucose) levels fall low enough that they need to take immediate action. For people with diabetes, low blood sugar usually happens when blood sugar levels fall below 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), though some people have symptoms of low blood sugar at higher levels.</p><p>“Low blood sugar is most common for people with diabetes, especially those who take medications that increase insulin levels or otherwise lower blood sugar levels,” said Javier Morales, M.D., an endocrinologist and spokesperson for the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE). “Everyone with diabetes, as well as their friends and families, should be familiar with this condition and be prepared.”</p><p>Low blood sugar causes approximately 100,000 emergency room visits per year in the U.S. The potential risk of a low blood sugar emergency can take an emotional toll on people living with diabetes, disrupting day-to-day tasks. A third of adults with diabetes worry about driving safely because of possible low blood sugar episodes.</p><p><strong><em>Get the lowdown on low blood sugar</em></strong></p><p>Marquez has lived with Type 1 diabetes for over two decades and has experienced several low blood sugar emergencies since her first episode as a child. As an adult, she regularly volunteers with DiabetesSisters, a U.S. nonprofit that aims to improve the quality of life for women with diabetes and for those at risk.</p><p>“On that Sunday when I experienced low blood sugar for the first time, I remember that I’d skipped breakfast,” Marquez said. “I had also just begun diabetes treatment. Part of being prepared for a low blood sugar episode is knowing these types of risks, as well as possible signals that your blood sugar is low, so you can act quickly.”</p><p>Risk factors for low blood sugar include taking certain diabetes medications, eating less than usual, age, excessive alcohol consumption and increased exercise without enough nutrition. Symptoms can be mild, such as dizziness or unusual irritability, or more severe and life-threatening, such as seizures. Some people with milder symptoms may have episodes that go unnoticed, while others might have more serious symptoms and need family members or their support circles to be prepared to help.</p><p><strong><em>Be prepared for a low blood sugar emergency</em></strong></p><p>People with diabetes should speak to an endocrinologist (a physician who specializes in hormones and metabolism) about blood glucose targets, treatment options and how to prepare for a potential blood sugar emergency, and then share this plan with those close to them.</p><p>“It’s vital for people at risk to prepare for an emergency, but it’s also important that friends and family know how to act if needed,” Morales said. “It’s possible for someone with severe low blood sugar to become confused or unconscious, so people who are often around you also need to know the steps to take.”</p><p>For milder emergencies, Morales advises people to follow the Rule of 15, which involves eating 15 grams of carbohydrates or simple sugars and then rechecking blood sugar levels after 15 minutes. If blood sugar is still low, the person should have another serving. Once blood sugar levels are back to normal, they can eat a meal or snack to make sure it doesn’t lower again.</p><p>For severe emergencies, a person may need to administer emergency hypoglycemia rescue therapy, which contains an up-to-date prescription of glucagon in any delivery format (e.g., injection or nasal spray). Insulin should not be injected, as it will lower a person's blood sugar even more.</p><p>People in an emergency situation or those assisting them should also seek medical care or call for medical assistance, if needed. Be sure to tell the emergency dispatcher if a person has diabetes and may be experiencing severe low blood sugar.</p><p>Learn more about hypoglycemia and preparing for an emergency at <a href=\"http://www.bloodsugarlows.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">bloodsugarlows.com</a>.</p><p>Support for bloodsugarlows.com is provided by Eli Lilly and Company, Zealand Pharmaceuticals, NovoNordisk, Sanofi and Medtronic.</p>",

            "body": "If you’re suffering from joint pain and considering a joint replacement, you’re not alone. Chronic, debilitating pain that requires joint replacement affects nearly one in four adults in the United States, according to the U.S. Bone and Joint Initiative.[1] But unfortunately, many people wait years to move forward with surgery, enduring significant pain and negatively impacting their lives.This delay has worsened in the current climate of stress and fear of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, 48% of people reported they postponed elective joint replacement surgery due to fears and concerns stemming from COVID-19, according to a recent U.S. survey of 1,200 people comprised of joint replacement patients, candidates and their caregivers, conducted by Wakefield Research and commissioned by a leading medical device company Zimmer Biomet.[2] Informed by the results of this survey, Zimmer Biomet recently launched Don’t Let Pain Gain on You, an educational resource aimed at informing and empowering those living with joint pain to make informed decisions about joint replacement surgery in partnership with their healthcare professional.Although joint replacement is typically considered an elective surgery, it is an important tool in restoring people’s mobility and helping to enhance their quality of life. If you are considering joint replacement surgery and feeling hesitant during the COVID-19 pandemic, here are five things to consider:1. Quality of lifeRelief from debilitating pain is the number one benefit of joint replacement surgery. “Unfortunately, I have many patients who are suffering greatly from joint pain but have canceled or delayed their planned joint replacement procedures due to concerns stemming from COVID-19,” says Dr. Mark Klaassen,* orthopedic surgeon. “While this concern is understandable, it becomes a quality-of-life issue. I do my best to encourage people to proceed as soon as they feel comfortable, so that they can achieve relief from chronic, debilitating joint pain and move forward with their life.”Discussing all potential benefits and risks with your own doctor to determine the right time for you is important. Expectations and achievable level of pain-relief and mobility can vary depending on your specific pre-operative condition and activity level.2. Talk to your healthcare professional about an outpatient procedure and digital health platformsAsk your surgeon about your potential to have an outpatient surgical procedure so that you may be able to be discharged on the same day of surgery and recover at home instead of spending additional time in the hospital – which may be particularly appealing during the pandemic. Additionally, you can ask your healthcare professional about technological innovations in joint replacement surgery such as robotics and digital health platforms that are available in some locations, for appropriate patients. One such option is mymobility® with Apple Watch®** from Zimmer Biomet, a first-of-its-kind remote care management system that uses iPhone® and Apple Watch to facilitate a new level of connection between patients and their surgical care teams that is also intended to help minimize the need for unnecessary physical touchpoints.3. Understand the safety protocols in place to help minimize exposure to COVID-19If you are concerned about your safety at this time, it is important to realize that there are state mandated protocols and guidance in place to help reduce the risk of COVID-19 exposure.[3] According to Dr. Klaassen, “Hospitals and surgery centers across the country are typically utilizing extremely stringent policies and procedures to help keep people safe. If safety concerns are holding you back, I urge you to discuss further with your healthcare professional as I personally don’t see this as a reason to further delay a necessary joint replacement procedure.”Becky D., a mother and grandmother from Warsaw, Ind., and a patient of Dr. Klaassen’s, recently underwent two separate joint replacement procedures, in the middle of COVID-19—the first, in March 2020, was a total knee replacement and the second, in June 2020, was a partial knee replacement.Becky reflects on her experience after her two knee replacement surgeries during COVID-19. “Overall, I found it to be a positive experience and I am glad I moved forward with it. I had some pain for a few weeks after surgery, and worked very hard with my rehabilitation exercises.” said Becky. “Two months after surgery, I am so relieved not to have that debilitating pain I had before surgery, and I am able to be more active again, going to my grandkids’ sporting events and ready to decorate for the holidays.'4. Consider your caregiversFor many people suffering from severe joint pain, family members and caregivers are often a critical part of the process, so don’t forget to consider the impact that continuing to delay your joint replacement surgery could have on them. Data shows that caregivers of people with joint pain can face a decrease in their quality of life and an increase in stress as they bear added responsibilities or household duties.[4] In fact, according to Zimmer Biomet’s survey, 56% of caregivers wished their loved one would move forward with surgery more quickly even during the pandemic in order to relieve their physical pain and the negative impact on quality of life.[2] While caregiver responsibilities may increase during your recovery, completing your surgery might not only help you get back on your feet but also help relieve your caregivers of extra burdens.5. Delaying joint replacement surgery can lead to additional pain Zimmer Biomet’s survey also found that those who have postponed their elective joint replacement surgery due to COVID-19 related concerns report that their daily lives have been impacted, citing increases in pain (71%), mobility changes (58%), and worsening sleep (36%).[2] Talk to your surgeon about what’s right for you. Whether you’ve put off your joint replacement surgery or haven’t yet scheduled, now may be the time to take action to resolve your joint pain, so you can get back to enjoying your daily life.If you have chronic, debilitating joint pain, consider taking action to address it.

            "body": "The impact of COVID-19 has changed many aspects of our everyday lives, particularly for those living with a chronic condition like diabetes. Even under normal circumstances, managing diabetes can be difficult, but with the added challenges of the pandemic, access to medical care, medications, and other diabetes products has become increasingly difficult for many.Living with diabetes is expensive. The average yearly cost to manage the condition is almost $10,000,[1] and data show that two in five Americans living with diabetes experience financial hardship from medical bills – even when properly insured.[2] Since the pandemic began, as many as 18% of Americans with diabetes have faced unemployment, making the ability to afford medication and medical care an even greater challenge. As a result, many people living with diabetes were not adhering to their diabetes management regimens, which may jeopardize their overall health, especially considering this community is at risk of developing more serious complications from the virus.[3] In fact, a study from earlier this summer found that one in four people with diabetes have started skipping medication doses and testing their glucose less often to extend their supplies.[3] The pandemic is not only impacting finances, it is also changing the way healthcare is delivered. There has been a greater acceptance of telehealth and remote monitoring for chronic conditions like diabetes from both patients and the health care industry – underscoring the important role that diabetes technology can play.One example of a technology that is helping physicians monitor their patients remotely is integrated continuous glucose monitors (iCGMs) like Abbott's FreeStyle Libre 2 system, which features a small sensor worn on the back of the upper arm for up to 14 days and accurately measures glucose every minute, eliminating the need for fingersticks.[4] With a one-second scan using a handheld reader, adults and children ages four and up can see their real-time glucose reading, an eight-hour history of glucose data and a trend arrow showing where their levels are heading. These actionable insights allow people with diabetes and their physicians to make more informed decisions about treatments, exercise and nutrition, even when in-person visits aren’t possible.“My continuous glucose monitor has greatly improved my quality of life. I no longer need to do multiple, painful fingersticks a day and can see which direction my glucose levels are trending, which makes managing my diabetes so much easier,” said Kendall Kidder-Goshorn, who has been living with type 1 diabetes for 26 years. “When I’m using the FreeStyle Libre 2, I spend less time worrying about my glucose levels, so CGM technology is directly responsible for me being the healthiest I’ve been in years. I think every person living with diabetes should have access to revolutionary technologies like CGMs, so they can be their healthiest self, too.”As CGMs have shown evidence to be effective at helping people with diabetes better manage their condition and improve health outcomes, they are being more widely embraced. For instance, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) now provides reimbursement for the FreeStyle Libre 2 system[5] and recently gave healthcare professionals more flexibility to prescribe CGMs during the pandemic. While this marks significant progress, many people with diabetes still can't access CGMs due to insurance restrictions or high-deductible costs and co-pays.“From the start, Abbott set out to make our FreeStyle Libre portfolio available to as many people living with diabetes as possible. That's why we priced it 70% lower than other CGMs, without sacrificing performance and accuracy,' said Mahmood Kazemi, M.D., chief medical officer, Diabetes Care, Abbott. 'We're working to ensure all people living with diabetes have access to the life-changing benefits of our technology, all at a fraction of the cost of other available CGMs.'Life with diabetes can be stressful enough, but with access to breakthrough technology like CGMs, daily care can be simpler to manage, even during a pandemic.

The <a href=\"https://www.diabetes.org/resources/statistics/cost-diabetes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">average yearly cost</a> to manage the condition is almost $10,000,<a title=\"\" href=\"#_edn1\" rel=\"nofollow\" name=\"_ednref1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> and data show that <a href=\"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.119.006139\" rel=\"nofollow\">two in five</a> Americans living with diabetes experience financial hardship from medical bills – even when properly insured.<a title=\"\" href=\"#_edn2\" rel=\"nofollow\" name=\"_ednref2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> Since the pandemic began, as many as 18% of Americans with diabetes have faced unemployment, making the ability to afford medication and medical care an even greater challenge. As a result, many people living with diabetes were not adhering to their diabetes management regimens, which may jeopardize their overall health, especially considering this community is at risk of developing more serious complications from the virus.<sup><a title=\"\" href=\"#_edn3\" rel=\"nofollow\">[3]</a></sup> In fact, a <a href=\"https://www.diabetes.org/newsroom/press-releases/2020/new-data-highlights-severe-health-and-economic-impact-of-pandemic-on-millions-living-with-diabetes\" rel=\"nofollow\">study</a> from earlier this summer found that one in four people with diabetes have started skipping medication doses and testing their glucose less often to extend their supplies.<sup><a title=\"\" href=\"#_edn3\" rel=\"nofollow\" name=\"_ednref3\">[3]</a></sup> <br><br>The pandemic is not only impacting finances, it is also changing the way healthcare is delivered. There has been a greater acceptance of telehealth and remote monitoring for chronic conditions like diabetes from both patients and the health care industry – underscoring the important role that diabetes technology can play.</p><p>One example of a technology that is helping physicians monitor their patients remotely is integrated continuous glucose monitors (iCGMs) like Abbott's <a href=\"https://www.freestylelibre.us/system-overview/freestyle-libre-2.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">FreeStyle Libre 2</a> system, which features a small sensor worn on the back of the upper arm for up to 14 days and accurately measures glucose every minute, eliminating the need for fingersticks.<sup><a title=\"\" href=\"#_edn4\" rel=\"nofollow\" name=\"_ednref4\">[4]</a></sup> With a one-second scan using a handheld reader, adults and children ages four and up can see their real-time glucose reading, an eight-hour history of glucose data and a trend arrow showing where their levels are heading. These actionable insights allow people with diabetes and their physicians to make more informed decisions about treatments, exercise and nutrition, even when in-person visits aren’t possible.</p><p>“My continuous glucose monitor has greatly improved my quality of life. I no longer need to do multiple, painful fingersticks a day and can see which direction my glucose levels are trending, which makes managing my diabetes so much easier,” said Kendall Kidder-Goshorn, who has been living with type 1 diabetes for 26 years. “When I’m using the FreeStyle Libre 2, I spend less time worrying about my glucose levels, so CGM technology is directly responsible for me being the healthiest I’ve been in years. I think every person living with diabetes should have access to revolutionary technologies like CGMs, so they can be their healthiest self, too.”</p><p>As CGMs have shown evidence to be effective at helping people with diabetes better manage their condition and improve health outcomes, they are being more widely embraced. For instance, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) now provides reimbursement for the FreeStyle Libre 2 system<a title=\"\" href=\"#_edn5\" rel=\"nofollow\" name=\"_ednref5\"><sup>[5]</sup></a> and recently gave healthcare professionals <a href=\"https://provider.myfreestyle.com/covid-19-information.html#medicare-section\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">more flexibility</a> to prescribe CGMs during the pandemic. While this marks significant progress, many people with diabetes still can't access CGMs due to insurance restrictions or high-deductible costs and co-pays.</p><p>“From the start, Abbott set out to make our FreeStyle Libre portfolio available to as many people living with diabetes as possible. That's why we priced it 70% lower than other CGMs, without sacrificing performance and accuracy,\" said Mahmood Kazemi, M.D., chief medical officer, Diabetes Care, Abbott. \"We're working to ensure all people living with diabetes have access to the life-changing benefits of our technology, all at a fraction of the cost of other available CGMs.\"</p><p>Life with diabetes can be stressful enough, but with access to breakthrough technology like CGMs, daily care can be simpler to manage, even during a pandemic.

            "body": "He was nearing the end of the race, but Brian Greenberg thought he couldn’t possibly finish. He had a stomach cramp and his lungs were begging him to stop. At that point, he had done a 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bicycle ride, and was in the last leg of his 26.2-mile run. It had been over 15 hours, and he still had an hour of running to go.Pain. That’s what his entire body was screaming.Just a few years earlier, Brian was experiencing a different type of pain. He could barely move without immense distress radiating from his abdomen. He was bedbound, living under the care of his parents, his days punctuated by visits from a wound care nurse as his body tried to fight the symptoms of a badly inflamed gastrointestinal tract.For Brian, competing in the Ironman Mont Tremblant was an important personal milestone in what had been a 25+ year-long journey to outpace his Crohn’s disease, a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Since he was 11 years old, Brian’s own body has rebelled against him, causing him to sit on the sidelines for much of his teenage and adult life.In less than a decade, Brian’s condition evolved from mild stomach cramping to rupturing rectal abscesses. At age 21, while most of his peers were enjoying the care-free college lifestyle, he had a large part of his colon removed. At 28, he agreed to a full colectomy, a surgical procedure to remove his entire colon.Like most people who self-reported living with Crohn’s disease (82%, according to an online survey presented by AbbVie),*1 Brian experienced feelings of anxiety as a result of his disease. “Crohn’s impacts you emotionally in so many ways because there's fear when you wake up and anxiety that you have every single day, not to mention the fatigue and pain that rear their heads every so often,” said Brian.In fact, according to recent online survey results, 70% of people living with Crohn’s disease report feeling embarrassment and 80% reported experiencing feelings of depression as a result of their disease.1“The biggest misconception that the Crohn’s disease community has to overcome is that it’s just a ‘bathroom disease,’” said Brian, who remembers fearing how his condition would affect his romantic life as well as his social life.The physical and mental toll that Crohn’s disease takes on a person can impact day-to-day life. For example, 80% of patients from an online survey also reported that their Crohn’s disease symptoms had a moderate-to-severe impact on their daily life, with most agreeing that their condition limits their ability to socialize (77%) and spend time outside their home (66%). Nearly half say their condition limits their ability to work full time (45%).1“Before my disease was controlled, if I go out and I'm far from home, I have to think, ‘Okay, well, what might happen?’” said Brian.Doctors say open lines of communication with their patients are important to learn more about the emotional toll Crohn’s is having on their well-being as well as the specific ways in which the condition impacts everyday activities.“It’s important that people living with Crohn’s talk to their gastroenterologist and their healthcare team about both the physical and emotional impact of their disease, even more so during these times,” said survey researcher Laurie Keefer, Ph.D., director of the IBD Medical Home, GRITT-IBD, at Mount Sinai. “This is so that doctors can understand and fully assess the extent of the disease so that they can treat patients appropriately.”For Brian, he credits setting what he calls “turtle steps,” having an open conversation with his healthcare team, and advocating for an effective treatment plan as key to his journey from being bedridden to reaching his athletic goals.His first “turtle step” goal was to make his own grilled cheese sandwich after one of his major surgeries. Soon, with hard work and planning, he was hiking, biking and climbing, training as a triathlete and completing a half Ironman.Finally, in 2018, with his then girlfriend — now, wife — cheering him on, Brian crossed the finish line of the 140.6-mile full Ironman at 16 hours and 13 minutes.Pain has momentarily given in to sheer, overwhelming euphoria.“Having Crohn's disease has taught me that life is not going to be easy, but it’s what you make of it,” said Brian. “Not everyone dreams of becoming an Ironman. Find and set goals for yourself and set turtle steps along the way. Don’t be shy about sharing these with your healthcare team either. It’s when you’re working together and aligned on goals that the best decisions about your care can be made.”Understanding the wide-ranging implications of IBD can be the first step toward a proactive treatment plan that works for you.

The second U.S. online survey, Unmet Needs of Patients with IBD: Patient Perspectives on Treatment Experience, conducted between November 11 to November 18, 2019, was completed by 502 people who self-identified as having Crohn's disease (296 people) or ulcerative colitis (206 people) to better understand how treatment choices are made, most desired treatment outcomes, and satisfaction with primary HCPs.

            "body": "Once a house fire starts, you have three minutes or less to escape. UL Firefighter Safety Research Institute (FSRI) is encouraging everyone to take three critical steps to help protect themselves and their loved ones should a house fire occur.According to a recent survey from UL FSRI, more than a quarter (27%) of people estimated they would have more than three minutes to safely exit their home in the event of a home fire. Although a majority of people understand that they need to quickly exit their home, 47.8% of people believe they would have enough time to gather what’s important to them and safely exit their home.“What we see from our annual safety survey is that many people still underestimate the danger of a home fire,” said Steve Kerber, vice president of research at UL FSRI. “During a fire, rooms can quickly be filled with toxic smoke. What is particularly concerning is that people think they will have time to gather what’s important to them, ignoring the likelihood that smoke will have reduced visibility and can cause harm quickly.”UL FSRI’s new video shows how a room becomes unlivable in just three minutes, underscoring the need to get out quickly. Here are three simple, potentially life-saving fire safety behaviors people can adopt to give them more time to respond and escape in the event of a fire:1. Check Your Smoke Alarms Have working smoke alarms on every floor of your home, including inside and outside every sleeping area. Check your smoke alarms monthly and replace them every 10 years. Smoke alarms give you and your loved ones the earliest possible warning that there is a fire.2. Create an Escape PlanHave an escape plan and practice it; know two ways to get out if there is a fire. If smoke blocks a door or first way out, use your second way out. Also, if your first way out is blocked, get a closed door between you and the fire to buy time to use your second way out, especially if that requires escaping out a window.61.8% of respondents indicated they have a fire escape plan, but more than half (56%) only review that plan once per year or less often. Nearly 40% of people have no escape plan at all.3. Close Before You DozeA closed door can be an effective barrier against deadly levels of carbon monoxide, smoke and flames, and may give you more time to respond to the smoke alarm. In fact, there can be a 900-degree Fahrenheit difference in room temperature between a room with an open door and one with a closed door, with the open-door room reaching temperatures of 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit or more. In 2018, UL FSRI released its “Dramatic Difference” video demonstrating this comparison.The annual fire safety survey conducted in September 2020 shows that many misconceptions still exist around fire safety. Only 35% of people always sleep with their door closed, up from 26% in 2019. And while more than half of the responses (58%) indicated that they would be alerted to a home fire by their smoke alarm, one-third (33%) of respondents hold the belief that they would be alerted by the smell of smoke, while another 9% believed they would be alerted by other factors such as temperature or a family pet.“While some people think they will be alerted to a home fire by the smell of smoke, if someone is asleep, they would likely be incapacitated by the smoke before they could ever smell it,” Kerber continued. “Our new video drives home the point that fire moves fast, and people should be prepared now with smoke alarms, escape plans and by closing their bedroom doors at night.”For information on the research behind these life-saving initiatives and more fire-safety tips, visit CloseYourDoor.org."

            "body": "Now more than ever, Americans are spending extended periods of time at home. From sitting for long hours working and logging more time in front of the TV, to uncontrollable snacking and changing bathroom habits, the behavioral changes resulting from more time at home are impacting overall health, especially for our backsides. In fact, according to a new survey commissioned by Preparation H, three in five Americans reveal they have experienced aches and pains due to habits they’ve developed at home since the pandemic began.While some of the new practices instituted during the pandemic may seem inevitable, they could be causing discomfort. To help remedy potential harmful habits developed as a result of being at home more often, the following tips can help combat potential pains and help you find relief.1. Workstation slumpThe sudden shift from working in an office to working at home has caused plenty of new behaviors, including slumping and poor posture. As more than half of Americans had to create makeshift workstations at home, many have found themselves working from their couches, kitchen chairs or even beds. While a bed or couch might provide a soft and comfortable setting for relaxing, they are not ideal for productive, long-term use and ultimately not the best for health, as a plush seat lacks support and can lead to slouching. With nearly two-thirds of working Americans finding themselves working longer hours since working from home, switching up your choice of seating can help prevent bad posture and back and neck pain. Opting for a firmer chair with proper back support is key to stop the slumping and keep you comfortable when working long hours. Additionally, the survey revealed that, on average, Americans have spent four hours sitting in one spot without getting up, and remaining sedentary for lengthy amounts of time can lead to health effects. Set a goal to get off your butt throughout the day to stretch out and get the blood flowing — aim for at least five minutes of standing and moving each hour and track your progress. Setting a movement notification and blocking those few minutes on your calendar can make a big difference.2. Toilet devotee More time at home has also affected bathroom habits. Since the pandemic began in 2020, 39% of Americans admit they have spent much longer periods of time on the toilet than ever before. Extended toilet time can place added pressure on your backside, potentially leading to discomfort, like pain, itching or hemorrhoids. In fact, nearly a quarter of Americans have experienced hemorrhoids while spending more time at home, with men afflicted two times more than women. If you experience any of these discomforts and need relief, the new Preparation H Soothing Relief line provides everyday comfort and is specifically formulated to soothe, cool, cleanse and care for your backside. The line features a maximum-strength Anti-Itch Cream and Cleansing &amp; Cooling Wipes for convenient relief that goes beyond cleaning.3. Scrolling awayIt’s no surprise that social media use and content streaming are hitting all-time highs this year. Compared to before the pandemic, two-thirds of Americans (66%) shared they are watching more television and movies through streaming services than they did previously and nearly 60% revealed that they feel they are on social media more. That’s a lot of scrolling! Whether you’re looking for the next show to binge or refreshing your favorite apps, too much screen time can fatigue the eyes, affect mental health and disrupt sleep patterns. Set a timer on your television and phone to help regulate consumption, especially before bedtime, and take breaks for healthier activities like phone calls with friends and family or walks outside.4. Exercise experimentationPhysical activity is especially important as it provides various health and wellness benefits. However, out of the ordinary workout routines may lead to newfound discomfort. On average, one in five Americans think their new exercise routines at home are the reason behind their backside discomfort! Before tuning into a virtual workout class or hitting the pavement for a run, make sure you are taking the proper time to warm up your body and stretch to help prevent any injuries. If working with heavy weights at home, keep in mind that vigorous straining can cause backside issues — so make sure to slowly increase weights or lift with a workout buddy to help keep each other safe and in check.5. Kitchen addictionRound-the-clock access to the kitchen and increased levels of stress can mean constant snacking and bad food choices. Processed foods can be low in fiber and not easily digestible, potentially causing constipation, which can in turn lead to discomfort, straining or hemorrhoids. Opt for high-fiber meals and snacks and try keeping a bowl of fruit on the kitchen counter or table so there is easy access to a healthier snack option.With more time spent at home, developing less-than-optimal habits may be difficult to avoid. It’s important to be aware of the mindless behaviors that impact our health, so we can be mindful about implementing lifestyle changes to correct them. By remembering these tips, you can be on your way to eliminating unhealthy at-home activities and finding relief when discomfort strikes.For more information on Preparation H and how you can keep your butt comfortable, visit www.preparationh.com."

As one of the longest-standing leaders in the industry, Sylvania knows that dimming headlight bulbs may present roadway dangers and is working to educate consumers on the importance of proactive headlight bulb maintenance.As part of the campaign, Sylvania conducted research to determine how consumers feel about replacing their headlights and found that nearly 8 in 10 drivers are unaware that headlights can dim considerably over time and wait until burnout to replace theirs. Furthermore, this gradual dimming of headlights can lead to a loss of up to 50 feet of visibility even before headlights reach total burnout — an amount approximately equal to the same length as a semi-truck.With days getting shorter and nights getting longer, many drivers will find themselves on dark roads more often in the coming months. According to the National Safety Council and Geico, fatal accidents are three times more likely to happen at night. And that’s not all — the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recently reported that even though the COVID-19 pandemic has decreased overall road traffic, those still on the road are engaging in riskier driving behaviors, like speeding and forgoing seatbelts.According to the CDC, nearly 150,000 bicyclists and pedestrians are hit by cars each year, and more than 6,000 of these individuals were killed in 2019 — the highest number since 1990. While more automobile makers are increasing the safety technologies in their vehicles, it is still the responsibility of each driver to ensure they are keeping those in bike lanes and crosswalks safe. One way to increase your safety while driving in the dark is to ensure that your headlights are properly lit.Greg Bibbo, Director of Aftermarket Sales and Marketing at Sylvania, recommends that drivers replace their headlights regularly and in pairs to avoid uneven illumination. “If you’ve never changed your headlight bulbs and feel that your nighttime visibility is declining, this Headlight Savings Time is a great opportunity to switch your headlights out with a new set of bulbs and make changing your headlights part of your vehicle’s overall maintenance.”This Headlight Savings Time, Sylvania encourages all drivers to consider replacing your headlight bulbs before they burn out to ensure nighttime visibility for you, your passengers, and everyone else on the road around you.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that figure, citing over 194 drug-related deaths in the U.S. every day last year. And unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has only increased the dangers posed by misuse or abuse of drugs in the home. Beyond the fact that the pandemic has temporarily closed resources such as drug drop-box sites and take-back day events, opioid and other drug misuse risks have also increased due to financial and emotional stressors such as isolation and unemployment.Any medications in the home carry the risk of someone misusing them, whether accidentally or on purpose. According to the National Institutes of Health, an estimated 92% of post-surgical prescriptions went unused, making them available for potential misuse. And according to a Journal of the American Medical Association study, over 60% of people with leftover prescription opioids kept pills for future use rather than disposing of them, with one in five admitting they shared medication with someone else.How can you help prevent drug misuse? Here are tips to keep your home safer for everyone.1. Store medicines securelyWhile many store medications in a medicine cabinet, humidity levels in a bathroom can actually break down medications, making them less effective. In addition, storing meds in a medicine cabinet makes them susceptible to theft by anyone entering your home looking for drugs. Storing prescription medications in a bedside table may also seem convenient, but again leaves them open for misuse or abuse.This is especially true if you have children living in or frequently visiting your home, it's best to keep all medications — including vitamins — in a high cabinet and secured out of harm’s way.2. Discard medications safelyGo through prescription and over-the-counter medications regularly to identify leftover or expired medicines. This helps prevent accidental or purposeful misuse, which protects your entire family.To safely dispose of medicines, the Deterra® Drug Deactivation System is a medication disposal pouch or container that can be used at home. It is the safest, most effective way to irreversibly destroy and properly dispose of unused, unwanted and expired medications in minutes, with the simple addition of tap water. Deterra is the only product available today that is scientifically proven to deactivate prescription and over-the-counter medicines, including addictive opioids. Deterra’s plant-based packaging, with non-toxic ingredients, also helps prevent harmful chemicals from entering landfills and water supplies.3. Keep poison control information handyPost the contact information for Poison Control where everyone can see it, like on your refrigerator door. Access Poison Control online at www.poison.org or by calling 1-800-222-1222.4. Don’t call medications “candy”If someone in your family takes medicine or vitamins, never refer to it as “candy” to convince the child to take it or to explain why you’re taking it. This could make the child more likely to try taking pills that they find.5. Don’t share prescriptions You may think you’re doing a friend or relative a favor by sharing pills from a leftover pain prescription but that medication was prescribed to you by a healthcare provider for a specific purpose, with knowledge of your health condition and other medications you take. You may not be aware of potentially harmful drug interactions or side effects your friend could experience by taking your medication. Stay safe by disposing of unused medications as soon as you no longer need to take them.Visit deterrasystem.com for more information and to order Deterra Drug Deactivation pouches to make your home safer."

            "title": "Stop ignoring your bladder: 6 tips to control leakage",
            "author": "BrandPoint",
            "pub_date": "November 05, 2020",
            "word_count": "601",
            "summary": "",
            "body": "Whether you’re exercising, sneezing, laughing or simply going about your day, a leaky bladder can stop you in your tracks. Whether mild or severe, the physical and emotional burden of unexpected leaks can cause some women to feel embarrassed. This can lead to disruptive 'hacks' to manage their condition — such as wearing only black pants, avoiding liquid intake, or skipping enjoyable activities with family and friends.“We all know the feeling of surprise when a cough triggers a bladder leak or panic when you've waited too long to find a bathroom,” says Younger actress Debi Mazar. “Incontinence is much more common than you think, and it can be managed without compromising your life or confidence.”As experts in health and wellness, Walgreens offers the following tips to manage the issue healthily, and encourages women to abandon the silly management hacks for good.1. Track your triggersEvery person is different, and it’s important to discover what factors may encourage your bladder leaks. For some, certain spicy or acidic foods, alcohol, and carbonated or caffeinated beverages may be the culprit. Other factors like smoking, chronic coughing and body weight can also contribute. Consider keeping a food and behavior journal to figure out what could be setting off leaks.2. Choose products wiselyIt's important that products work for your individual situation — function and comfort are key. Look for products that guarantee security, like Walgreens Certainty™ incontinence products. From liners and pads to protective underwear and briefs, a dry-lock core helps lock in moisture to keep you feeling dry and comfortable.“As health and wellness experts, we know that not everyone is visiting the incontinence aisle with the same needs or at the same stage in life,” says Rina Shah, group vice president of Walgreens pharmacy operations &amp; services. “Walgreens Certainty™ brand has the widest range of product offerings so customers don't need to feel like their incontinence is being treated as 'one size fits all.'”3. Find your strength Exercise can be a helpful way to reduce bladder leaks by strengthening the muscles of your pelvic floor. Try a low impact workout like yoga, Pilates, tai chi, walking or Kegel exercises.4. Drink fluidsWhile you may be tempted to limit your water intake to avoid leaks, it can actually encourage leakage if you aren't drinking enough. For a healthy bladder, you need at least 48 ounces of water each day, depending on your body type and activity level, according to the National Association for Continence. Drink continuously throughout the day to avoid over-filling your bladder at once, which is when accidents are more likely to happen.

            "html": "<p>Whether you’re exercising, sneezing, laughing or simply going about your day, a leaky bladder can stop you in your tracks. Whether mild or severe, the physical and emotional burden of unexpected leaks can cause some women to feel embarrassed. This can lead to disruptive \"hacks\" to manage their condition — such as wearing only black pants, avoiding liquid intake, or skipping enjoyable activities with family and friends.</p><p>“We all know the feeling of surprise when a cough triggers a bladder leak or panic when you've waited too long to find a bathroom,” says <em>Younger</em> actress Debi Mazar. “Incontinence is much more common than you think, and it can be managed without compromising your life or confidence.”</p><p>As experts in health and wellness, Walgreens offers the following tips to manage the issue healthily, and encourages women to abandon the silly management hacks for good.</p><p><strong>1. Track your triggers</strong></p><p>Every person is different, and it’s important to discover what factors may encourage your bladder leaks. For some, certain spicy or acidic foods, alcohol, and carbonated or caffeinated beverages may be the culprit. Other factors like smoking, chronic coughing and body weight can also contribute. Consider keeping a food and behavior journal to figure out what could be setting off leaks.</p><p><strong>2. Choose products wisely</strong></p><p>It's important that products work for your individual situation — function and comfort are key. Look for products that guarantee security, like <a href=\"https://www.walgreens.com/search/results.jsp?Ntt=certainty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Walgreens Certainty™</a> incontinence products. From liners and pads to protective underwear and briefs, a dry-lock core helps lock in moisture to keep you feeling dry and comfortable.</p><p>“As health and wellness experts, we know that not everyone is visiting the incontinence aisle with the same needs or at the same stage in life,” says Rina Shah, group vice president of Walgreens pharmacy operations &amp; services. “Walgreens Certainty™ brand has the widest range of product offerings so customers don't need to feel like their incontinence is being treated as 'one size fits all.'”</p><p><strong>3. Find your strength </strong></p><p>Exercise can be a helpful way to reduce bladder leaks by strengthening the muscles of your pelvic floor. Try a low impact workout like yoga, Pilates, tai chi, walking or Kegel exercises.</p><p><strong>4. Drink fluids</strong></p><p>While you may be tempted to limit your water intake to avoid leaks, it can actually encourage leakage if you aren't drinking enough. For a healthy bladder, you need at least 48 ounces of water each day, depending on your body type and activity level, according to the National Association for Continence. Drink continuously throughout the day to avoid over-filling your bladder at once, which is when accidents are more likely to happen. If leaks are more prevalent overnight, cut back on liquids in the evening before bed.</p><p><strong>5. Create a schedule</strong></p><p>Consider timing out your urges to use the bathroom and create a routine. Try setting timers on your phone as reminders. If you feel the urge every two hours, go to the bathroom every 90 minutes. Eventually, you may be able to train your bladder to go longer in between bathroom breaks.</p><p><strong>6. Talk to an expert </strong></p><p>If you’re struggling with a leaky bladder, your doctor or pharmacist can help. Incontinence is extremely common, and trained professionals can share advice on the right medications, products and procedures for your individual condition. Come prepared with a list of how frequently you experience leaks, the severity, and what triggers may be the cause. This will help an expert give specific advice for your unique situation.</p><p>Don't spend another minute avoiding your favorite activities.

However, progress has been uneven and fragile, illuminating major disparities in care and access to care that leave certain demographics disproportionately burdened by the impact of HIV and AIDS; highlighting a growing health crisis within the Latinx community.New data shows that, while overall HIV diagnoses have decreased or plateaued in recent years, HIV diagnoses among Latinx gay and bisexual men have continued to increase, directly impacting more than 195,000 Hispanic/Latinx men in the U.S. and its territories, including Puerto Rico.[i] This data shows the standard of care is not benefitting everyone equally.[ii]For many Latinx men living with or affected by HIV or AIDS, this disparity is rooted in a number of social and cultural factors outside of their control, including long-standing and systemic issues such as poverty and unequal access to education, housing and reliable, safe public transportation that impact health outcomes across the board.[iii] Additionally, clinics and organizations often are unable to provide health education materials or translational services to the more than 37 million Spanish-speakers estimated to live in the U.S.[iv] The lack of culturally responsive and language-appropriate healthcare providers and materials create both a practical and psychological barrier to care.“When I first started working in the HIV space, I was the only LGBTQ person on staff – the only one who knew and understood what being gay and Latino in our community felt like and looked like. My being there shaped and changed the way we delivered our services,” says Elias Diaz, LMFT, Mental Health Clinician, Maverick County Hospital District. “The men we support tell stories about their experiences living with HIV that share common themes; stigma around their diagnosis and being LGBTQ, lack of emotional supports, in some instances, dependency on drugs. They struggled to find resources that reflected their experiences. What was being done with and for the LGBTQ Latinx community just wasn’t enough.”Fear and stigma associated with a positive diagnosis are compounded by the dynamic forces of family, religion, culture, economics – all of which are further exacerbated by anti-immigrant sentiment toward the Latinx community. These factors contribute to discrepancies in services offered to Latinx men leaving them to shoulder a greater burden that extends beyond their diagnosis and medical care.[v]To address these needs, community leaders and advocates agree on the importance of maintaining a pulse on the evolving landscape for and needs of Latinx gay, bi and trans men of all ages from different neighborhoods, economic situations and immigration statuses. A new report, “Here As I Am/Tal Como Soy” from ViiV Healthcare’s Positive Action for Latinx Men program, uses insights derived from a community-guided Listening Initiative to investigate how social, economic and political forces affect the health and well-being of Latinx men and influence access and adherence to care for those living with HIV. Conducted over the course of 10 months, the report features first-hand stories from members of the community that help to identify and fuel solutions that make a difference in the lives of Latinx men living with and affected by HIV.“As HIV and AIDS diagnoses are continuing to rise within our communities, we [are] sounding alarms to demand change. I [have] seen too many people who are fearful of following up with their healthcare providers in HIV care because of inadequate healthcare infrastructure and lack of culturally responsive services. This, coupled with internalized fear and shame within our community, is creating an obvious barrier to care and is a threat to our survival,” says Miguel Ángel (former Advocacy Associate Manager at NMAC). “As leaders and advocates who have been working in this space for many years, [we are] taking the lead by bringing our voices and needs forward to engage providers and policymakers in solutions to improve our access to care through ensuring all prevention initiatives consider language justice and many other unique needs of the Latinx community.”To learn more about Here As I Am/Tal Como Soy and ViiV Healthcare’s commitment to community-driven solutions through the Positive Action for Latinx Men initiative, and to read the report, available in both English and Spanish, visit: bit.ly/2Tbc2IU.[i] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

            "title": "Tips to help navigate health benefits open enrollment amid COVID-19",
            "author": "BrandPoint",
            "pub_date": "November 06, 2020",
            "word_count": "806",
            "summary": "",
            "body": "The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted people nationwide to live differently, including new challenges when it comes to navigating the health system and accessing care.Whether people are enrolling in a health plan offered through an employer, state-based exchange or government-sponsored program such as Medicare or Medicaid, this fall’s open-enrollment season for health benefits will likely be different than in the past. In fact, a recent UnitedHealthcare survey found that 44% of respondents expect COVID-19 to influence the health plan they intend to select, including 16% opting for an option with lower out-of-pocket costs and 10% selecting more comprehensive coverage.In most cases, the practice of gathering with coworkers or benefits consultants in a conference room to review health plan options may have been postponed. Even before COVID-19, technology was likely reshaping how people selected health benefits and obtained care, improving access to information and creating a more seamless and interactive health care experience. To help simplify the health care experience, promote well-being and potentially save money, here are five tips people may consider during open enrollment and year-round.Focus on health care literacy: According to the survey, more than 78% of Americans say they are prepared for open enrollment, yet previous CDC research has shown that some people struggle to fully understand common health care terms and concepts, including plan premium, deductible and co-insurance. In fact, a recent UnitedHealth Group study concluded that improving health literacy could prevent nearly 1 million hospital visits and save over $25 billion a year. People may help improve “health care literacy” by accessing public resources such as JustPlainClear.com, which provides definitions for thousands of common health care terms in English, Spanish and Portuguese.Tap into technology: Given COVID-19 may have changed how and where people obtain health care services, it may be important to select a health plan that includes coverage for virtual care, ideally including options for telehealth visits with your own doctor and 24/7 access to a national provider network. In fact, the use of virtual care resources has surged more than 10-fold compared to 2019, according to a 2020 UnitedHealthcare internal analysis, enabling some people to connect with a health care provider via a smartphone, tablet or personal computer. Telehealth resources are designed to be a more convenient way to visit with a doctor about various health issues, ranging from urgent and routine care, ongoing chronic condition management, behavioral health and specialty care such as oral and eye health.Watch out for wearables: Smartwatches and activity trackers are potential resources to help promote well-being and monitor various health measures, including daily steps, sleep patterns and blood sugar levels. Some health plans offer programs that may enable people to earn financial incentives for using wearables, such as fitness trackers to monitor daily steps or continuous glucose monitors to help members with type 2 diabetes. Other virtual programs may give people access to personalized, interactive online weight loss and exercise support. Using connected devices, it is possible to access near real-time data to help people modify daily behaviors and help care providers make more evidence-based recommendations.Comparison shop for care: Health care quality and cost may vary widely within a city or neighborhood, even though there may often be little or no corresponding improvement in health outcomes performed by higher-priced care providers, according to a Families USA report, “Price Transparency in Health Care.” Given that, more than half (56%) of Americans said they have used the internet or mobile apps during the last year to comparison shop for health care. While recent national efforts have helped spur greater transparency around hospital prices, people may find more specific — and personalized — estimates through their health plan. In addition, there are public websites that enable people to access market averages for hundreds of health care costs, providing baseline estimates to help inform the research process.Bundle benefits: While many people may focus on medical coverage during open enrollment, it may be important that people not overlook specialty benefits such as vision, dental, hearing and accident protection. In fact, the recent survey found that 84% of employees said having access to specialty benefits is “important.” Plus, people who combine medical coverage with specialty benefits through a single health care company may be able to benefit from services including clinical resources, which may help flag gaps in care, and preventive medical services, such as annual eye exams or teeth cleanings. That’s according to a recent UnitedHealthcare analysis of customers with integrated medical and specialty benefits.“COVID-19 continues to reshape many aspects of our lives, including how people research health plan options and access medical care,” said Rebecca Madsen, chief consumer officer of UnitedHealthcare. “By considering these tips, people may make more informed decisions related to health care coverage and access, while promoting well-being and helping prevent disease before it starts.”"

            "html": "<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted people nationwide to live differently, including new challenges when it comes to navigating the health system and accessing care.</p><p>Whether people are enrolling in a health plan offered through an employer, state-based exchange or government-sponsored program such as Medicare or Medicaid, this fall’s open-enrollment season for health benefits will likely be different than in the past. In fact, a recent <a href=\"https://newsroom.uhc.com/2020-consumer-survey.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">UnitedHealthcare survey</a> found that 44% of respondents expect COVID-19 to influence the health plan they intend to select, including 16% opting for an option with lower out-of-pocket costs and 10% selecting more comprehensive coverage.</p><p>In most cases, the practice of gathering with coworkers or benefits consultants in a conference room to review health plan options may have been postponed. Even before COVID-19, technology was likely reshaping how people selected health benefits and obtained care, improving access to information and creating a more seamless and interactive health care experience. To help simplify the health care experience, promote well-being and potentially save money, here are five tips people may consider during open enrollment and year-round.</p><p><strong>Focus on health care literacy: </strong>According to the survey, more than 78% of Americans say they are prepared for open enrollment, yet previous CDC research has shown that some people struggle to fully understand common health care terms and concepts, including plan premium, deductible and co-insurance. In fact, a <a href=\"https://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/viewer.html?file=/content/dam/UHG/PDF/About/Health-Literacy-Brief.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recent UnitedHealth Group study</a> concluded that improving health literacy could prevent nearly 1 million hospital visits and save over $25 billion a year. People may help improve “health care literacy” by accessing public resources such as JustPlainClear.com, which provides definitions for thousands of common health care terms in English, Spanish and Portuguese.</p><p><strong>Tap into technology:</strong> Given COVID-19 may have changed how and where people obtain health care services, it may be important to select a health plan that includes coverage for virtual care, ideally including options for telehealth visits with your own doctor and 24/7 access to a national provider network. In fact, the use of virtual care resources has surged more than 10-fold compared to 2019, according to a 2020 UnitedHealthcare internal analysis, enabling some people to connect with a health care provider via a smartphone, tablet or personal computer. Telehealth resources are designed to be a more convenient way to visit with a doctor about various health issues, ranging from urgent and routine care, ongoing chronic condition management, behavioral health and specialty care such as oral and eye health.</p><p><strong>Watch out for wearables:</strong> Smartwatches and activity trackers are potential resources to help promote well-being and monitor various health measures, including daily steps, sleep patterns and blood sugar levels. Some health plans offer programs that may enable people to earn financial incentives for using wearables, such as fitness trackers to monitor daily steps or continuous glucose monitors to help members with type 2 diabetes. Other virtual programs may give people access to personalized, interactive online weight loss and exercise support. Using connected devices, it is possible to access near real-time data to help people modify daily behaviors and help care providers make more evidence-based recommendations.</p><p><strong>Comparison shop for care:</strong> Health care quality and cost may vary widely within a city or neighborhood, even though there may often be little or no corresponding improvement in health outcomes performed by higher-priced care providers, according to a Families USA report, <a href=\"https://www.familiesusa.org/resources/price-transparency-in-health-care-an-introduction/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">“Price Transparency in Health Care.”</a> Given that, more than half (56%) of Americans said they have used the internet or mobile apps during the last year to comparison shop for health care. While recent national efforts have helped spur greater transparency around hospital prices, people may find more specific — and personalized — estimates through their health plan. In addition, there are public websites that enable people to access market averages for hundreds of health care costs, providing baseline estimates to help inform the research process.</p><p><strong>Bundle benefits: </strong>While many people may focus on medical coverage during open enrollment, it may be important that people not overlook specialty benefits such as vision, dental, hearing and accident protection.

            "body": "While Halloween will be different this year, you'll still likely be enjoying all your favorite Halloween candies — at least from the comfort of your own home. And face it, it's not just kids who like to indulge in sweet treats.While enjoying your favorite sticky candy and sugary chocolate bars, you don’t want to be frightened by the prospect of cavities or other issues with your teeth. Oral health is an important part of staying healthy overall, so to help you and your family maintain proper oral care during the Halloween season and beyond, ARM &amp; HAMMER Toothpastes has partnered with dental expert Dr. Derek Wallin, DDS to share his tips:1. Stick to regular routines — so candy won't stick to teethEspecially after taking some — and then probably a few more — bites of Halloween candy, don’t skip your nightly routine. Though the extra time at home may have you in your PJs throughout the day and night (no judgment!), remember to brush your teeth at least twice a day, and especially after dipping into the Halloween stash. To ensure that you are brushing long enough, set a timer on your phone for two minutes while you brush your teeth thoroughly from top to bottom, front and back. Never skip brushing before going to bed, as the cavity-causing bacteria that live in mouths can do a lot of damage while you're sleeping.2. Be choosy about Halloween candy … and when you eat itNot all candy is created equal, at least where your teeth are concerned. You probably guessed it: Candies that stick on and between teeth are the worst culprits. For example, taffy and gummy candies leave a sugary residue that’s hard to reach when it gets stuck between teeth and under gums. Chocolate or sugar-free candies are less damaging to your teeth and lead to less plaque buildup. Whatever type of candy you indulge in this Halloween season, enjoy it in moderation, and avoid hitting the candy stash after your nightly brushing.3. Don't brush immediately after eatingYou may be surprised to hear that it's better to wait a while after you've finished eating to brush your teeth. Your mouth has a higher acidity level right after eating, especially when you’ve been eating candy. Brushing while your teeth are more acidic can wear down and dissolve tooth enamel quickly, so it's best to wait 30 minutes after eating, if you can. One extra pro tip: Before you brush, swish with a mouthful of water to reduce any acid buildup and to help minimize damage to your enamel.4.

The latest ARM &amp; HAMMER Essentials Toothpastes are made with more of the essential ingredients you need for a healthy, beautiful smile, including naturally sourced calcium and essential oils sourced from natural North American peppermint to freshen breath.

            "html": "<p>While Halloween will be different this year, you'll still likely be enjoying all your favorite Halloween candies — at least from the comfort of your own home. And face it, it's not just kids who like to indulge in sweet treats.</p><p>While enjoying your favorite sticky candy and sugary chocolate bars, you don’t want to be frightened by the prospect of cavities or other issues with your teeth. Oral health is an important part of staying healthy overall, so to help you and your family maintain proper oral care during the Halloween season and beyond, <a href=\"https://www.armandhammer.com/oral-care/toothpastes/essentials\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ARM &amp; HAMMER Toothpastes</a> has partnered with dental expert Dr. Derek Wallin, DDS to share his tips:</p><p><strong>1. Stick to regular routines — so candy won't stick to teeth</strong></p><p>Especially after taking some — and then probably a few more — bites of Halloween candy, don’t skip your nightly routine. Though the extra time at home may have you in your PJs throughout the day and night (no judgment!), remember to brush your teeth at least twice a day, and especially after dipping into the Halloween stash. To ensure that you are brushing long enough, set a timer on your phone for two minutes while you brush your teeth thoroughly from top to bottom, front and back. Never skip brushing before going to bed, as the cavity-causing bacteria that live in mouths can do a lot of damage while you're sleeping.</p><p><strong>2. Be choosy about Halloween candy … and when you eat it</strong></p><p>Not all candy is created equal, at least where your teeth are concerned. You probably guessed it: Candies that stick on and between teeth are the worst culprits. For example, taffy and gummy candies leave a sugary residue that’s hard to reach when it gets stuck between teeth and under gums. Chocolate or sugar-free candies are less damaging to your teeth and lead to less plaque buildup. Whatever type of candy you indulge in this Halloween season, enjoy it in moderation, and avoid hitting the candy stash after your nightly brushing.</p><p><strong>3. Don't brush immediately after eating</strong></p><p>You may be surprised to hear that it's better to wait a while after you've finished eating to brush your teeth. Your mouth has a higher acidity level right after eating, especially when you’ve been eating candy. Brushing while your teeth are more acidic can wear down and dissolve tooth enamel quickly, so it's best to wait 30 minutes after eating, if you can. One extra pro tip: Before you brush, swish with a mouthful of water to reduce any acid buildup and to help minimize damage to your enamel.</p><p><strong>4. Use effective toothpaste</strong></p><p>Using great quality toothpaste when you brush can help keep your teeth and gums healthy, even when you occasionally enjoy sweets. Apart from a good toothbrush, I recommend using ARM &amp; HAMMER Toothpastes because they are made with 100% natural baking soda to naturally whiten teeth while quickly neutralizing acidity and restoring a more natural, balanced pH in your mouth to keep your teeth strong.

If your skin is sensitive, you may experience symptoms that make you feel uncomfortable.How do you know if you have sensitive skin?Because your skin is affected by your internal health and your external environment, there are many potential causes for skin sensitivity — and many possible treatments.Sensitive skin is typically caused by a compromised skin moisture barrier, allowing for increased water loss and faster absorption of irritants and allergens that come in contact with your skin. Psychological and emotional factors can also contribute to skin sensitivity, as well as environmental conditions.Whether your sensitive skin is on your face, body or both, it helps to identify common triggers.Everyday sensitive skin triggersWhile some people are genetically predisposed to sensitive skin, others can be sensitized by their environment and lifestyle. Some factors that may trigger sensitive skin reactions include temperature or humidity changes, pollution or smoking, plus use of soaps, household or cosmetic products — especially those containing high concentration of fragrances. Other potential triggers include medical treatments like chemotherapy or radiation, or factors like emotional stress or lack of sleep.The good news is, there are steps you can take in your everyday life to safeguard your skin against possible triggers.Create restorative spacesWe’ve been spending a lot more time at home, so it’s worth evaluating your living space. Making small changes can create a more restorative environment to improve your overall well-being, including the health of your skin.Humans are attracted to nature for a reason. Being in or around nature offers restorative benefits to your physical and emotional well-being. Here are four tips for bringing positive, natural elements into your environment and daily routine.1. Grow plants.Bring more plants into your home, as they can improve indoor air quality by absorbing toxins and increasing moisture levels — which helps nourish dry, sensitive skin.2. Stock up on gentle skincare.Use products specially created for sensitive skin. For example, Aveeno offers gentle cleansing and moisturizing products made from naturally derived ingredients — like oat — formulated to nourish, calm and restore skin so it looks and feels healthier. Oats have been used in skincare since ancient times for their ability to soothe and nourish skin, because they help:Both of the company’s new collections are formulated without fragrance, parabens and phthalates.For the body: The Aveeno Restorative Skin Therapy line is a dermatologist-tested body care regimen clinically proven to be well-tolerated and effective on distressed, sensitive skin.

            "body": "With all the changes that have occurred this year, it’s not surprising that women everywhere have been reassessing their skincare routines. Spending more time at home has spurred a focus on overall skin health and rituals to smooth out lines and wrinkles — and they want convenient solutions that get the job done but don’t cost a fortune.A new poll from RoC Skincare and Poshly surveyed 1,000 beauty shoppers to understand if women have shifted skincare habits since the pandemic. Results showed that while 71% had to make changes to their budget, they still want to maintain an effective routine.Whether they are rethinking high-end anti-aging treatments, skipping in-office visits or simply being more conservative with spending, women are turning to options found right in the drugstore aisle: 1 in 4 reported they have stopped getting injectables or professional skincare treatments and started using retinol and drugstore products.Fortunately, there are inexpensive practices and products out there like OTC retinol (a vitamin A derivative) that are effective at keeping skin looking bright, smooth and youthful, according to board-certified celebrity dermatologist Dr. Anna Guanche. “While some of my best advice to my patients may seem simple,” Guanche says, “it’s also all too easy to neglect the basics that really make a difference to protect and improve your skin.”Here Guanche shares her top anti-aging tips that involve either no cost or affordable items found online and at your local store.1. Go easy on the hot waterHot water can strip your skin of its natural oils, which can lead to dryness and the appearance of premature aging. Keep the water temperature from getting too hot (you can even set your water heater to a lower default temp).Pro tip: Apply moisturizer right out of the bath or shower, and immediately after washing your face.2. Look to retinol at nightRetinol is an anti-aging mainstay, and choosing one has never been easier because of the new Retinol Correxion Night Serum Capsules from RoC — the brand that discovered how to stabilize this superpower ingredient. This treatment in particular rivals prescription skincare options and it works — clinical testing showed 97% had visibly reduced lines and wrinkles after one night.“What I love about these Capsules is the instant gratification you get with overnight line smoothing benefits and how the results keep getting better overtime if you make them a regular part of your nighttime routine,” says Dr. Guanche. “And even better, they are perfectly dosed, don’t irritate skin and a steal for the price.”Find RoC at your local drugstores or Target.com.3. Prioritize sleepWhile you’re letting your skin absorb a retinol like RoC, make sure you’re sleeping a good eight hours per night if possible. Keeping your room cooler and darker at night will help ensure you’ll not only fall asleep more easily, but stay asleep longer, for the rest your body and face need.Pro tip: Launder your bedding regularly, especially your pillowcases! That way you know you're helping to keep your skin clean while you're getting your beauty rest.4. Stock up on vitamins'Keeping your skin looking and feeling its best is also a question of feeding it from within,' says Dr. Guanche. Taking daily supplements containing vitamins such as C, E, D and K will help nourish your skin from the inside out.Eating foods rich in vitamins, like colorful vegetables and fruits, is also a vital — and delicious — way to “feed” your skin well.5. Limit sun exposureWhile getting a little vitamin D from sunshine is a good thing, too much time under UV rays can prematurely age your skin — and put your skin at risk. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends using a facial moisturizer or sunscreen containing at least 30 SPF for the best protection against sunburn and skin cancer.Pro tip: Keep sunscreen near the door or in your bag so you'll remember to apply before going out.Sticking to these tips daily will make a big difference in how your skin looks and feels. Try a couple until they become habit, then try more. Your skin will thank you!"

            "body": "Whether you’re preserving a treasured hand-me-down, caring for an expensive sweater or just trying to maintain that perfect pair of jeans, the right cleaning steps can keep your favorite clothing looking and feeling better.A key solution? Choosing the right tools, additives and procedures to care for your most favored wardrobe items.“At first blush, learning how to do laundry is a simple task — throw in the clothes, add the detergent, press the button,” writes Kate Rockwood on Realsimple.com. “But after accidentally shrinking a sweater or ruining a few T-shirts with stubborn sweat stains, you quickly learn it's more complicated than it seems.”Unsure what you can be doing to better care for your favorite wardrobe? Consider the following five tips for a laundry process designed to work in your favor.1) Address stains earlyIf you spill something on a treasured garment, immediately blot the spot with a clean white cloth. If the clothing label allows for machine washing, apply a spot treatment ASAP, following the specific directions provided. Once the garment is washed, check to ensure the spot is completely gone before moving it to your dryer; otherwise, the additional heat could further set any remaining stain.2) Choose the right machineAll washers are not created equal; it’s worth shopping around for a model that features the technology you need to get the job done faster and more effectively. LG has a lot of options whether you prefer an agitator or impeller for your washing machine. Front load washers are undoubtedly the best on clothes and the LG Front Load Washer has the ability to both deep clean with the gentle power of TrueSteam and power clean with all 5 jets. If you prefer an agitator model, you’re still not far from the best. The LG Top Load Washer with Agitator, for example, has a 4-Way Agitator that uses up-and-down and back-and-forth movements to deep-clean your laundry with shorter cycles. This powerhouse, mega-capacity machine lets you customize the level of agitation to the delicacy of your clothes, and the LG ThinQ app lets you check on your cycle progress from anywhere at any time.3) Prep garments for washingInstead of tossing in your clothing indiscriminately, you’ll want to minimize the chances of snagging, pilling or other abrasions by zipping zippers and closing buckles, snaps, hooks and Velcro strips. Buttons are the exception; they should be left unbuttoned to prevent them from coming loose and to keep buttonholes from stretching. You may also wish to turn delicate items inside out and/or place them in mesh bags to prevent them from mingling with rougher or heavier-duty items.4) Give whites special treatmentYour sturdier whites can best be kept bright by washing them separately in hot water with bleach. More delicate whites may be safely lightened via a half-cup of white vinegar pre-diluted in a gallon of water and added to your wash cycle; others may respond well to being naturally dried in the sun.5) Customize settingsMany consumers don’t take time to fully utilize the settings on their washing machines that are intended for gentler care of delicate or fragile garments. If your clothing could be misshapen or shrunken by too much heat, wringing or agitation, you’ll want to pick the “delicate” or hand-wash” settings, opt for a cold-water wash and allow it to air dry instead of going through the dryer. As a general rule, hot water should be used for white loads, warm for average loads and cold for bright colors. You can also use the LG Styler to refresh garments. Using the power of steam, the LG Styler reduces odors and allergens on clothes for the perfect refresh.Knowing how to best clean your favorite wardrobe items will help ensure they’ll last for as long as you want to wear them. Take time to learn laundry basics so you can enjoy your top picks well into the future. Find more laundry tips and information on the best possible laundry equipment for your needs at LG.com."

            "html": "<p>Whether you’re preserving a treasured hand-me-down, caring for an expensive sweater or just trying to maintain that perfect pair of jeans, the right cleaning steps can keep your favorite clothing looking and feeling better.</p><p>A key solution? Choosing the right tools, additives and procedures to care for your most favored wardrobe items.</p><p>“At first blush, learning how to do laundry is a simple task — throw in the clothes, add the detergent, press the button,” writes Kate Rockwood on <a href=\"https://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/cleaning/laundry/laundry-tips-techniques\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Realsimple.com</a>. “But after accidentally shrinking a sweater or ruining a few T-shirts with stubborn sweat stains, you quickly learn it's more complicated than it seems.”</p><p>Unsure what you can be doing to better care for your favorite wardrobe? Consider the following five tips for a laundry process designed to work in your favor.</p><p><strong>1) Address stains early</strong></p><p>If you spill something on a treasured garment, immediately blot the spot with a clean white cloth. If the clothing label allows for machine washing, apply a spot treatment ASAP, following the specific directions provided. Once the garment is washed, check to ensure the spot is completely gone before moving it to your dryer; otherwise, the additional heat could further set any remaining stain.</p><p><strong>2) Choose the right machine</strong></p><p>All washers are not created equal; it’s worth shopping around for a model that features the technology you need to get the job done faster and more effectively. LG has a lot of options whether you prefer an agitator or impeller for your washing machine. Front load washers are undoubtedly the best on clothes and the <a href=\"https://www.lg.com/us/washers/lg-wm4500hba-front-load-washer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LG Front Load Washer</a> has the ability to both deep clean with the gentle power of TrueSteam and power clean with all 5 jets. If you prefer an agitator model, you’re still not far from the best.

            "body": "Tim is like any other 26-year-old — he lives on his own and has a job. He is also one of the 2.8 million adults living with schizophrenia in the United States.For those in his small community, Tim may be the first person living with schizophrenia that they have ever met. According to Tim, it is important for him to talk to others to address any stigma and misconceptions they may have: “I want to help others learn what people with schizophrenia are like. I’m just a normal guy!”For adults living with schizophrenia, a strong support system, often consisting of healthcare providers (HCPs) and loved ones, and the right treatment plan, can make the difference. For Tim, his mom and caregiver, Chrisa, plays an active role in his care.“When people meet Tim and find out that he has schizophrenia, they are surprised because he’s not what they expected,” Chrisa remarked. “Sharing our story has helped other families feel less alone, and the community better understands schizophrenia and what people can do and accomplish with the right treatment plan.”Like many adults living with schizophrenia, Tim’s treatment journey hasn’t been easy. When he was first diagnosed, Tim and his family had little knowledge about schizophrenia and the treatment options available to them. Tim has tried many different medications since he was first diagnosed, cycling through periods where his symptoms were well managed, before experiencing breakthrough symptoms or relapse.Recently, Tim switched from an oral daily medication to a once-monthly injection because he did not like having to take his medication every day and was afraid that he would forget his treatment.According to Chrisa, it is important for adults living with schizophrenia and their caregivers to learn about the different treatment choices available, including the side effects and benefits, and work with their HCP to find the right treatment for them. Individuals should also make sure they are prepared in advance of any potential treatment changes. “Before Tim transitioned to a once-monthly injection, we worked with his HCP to make sure that we had a plan in place to navigate any potential challenges,” Chrisa remarked.Ultimately, Tim made the final decision regarding his treatment: “I learned about the different options from my doctors and my mom. I liked all the information they shared about the once-monthly injection, and decided that it was the right treatment option for me.” Tim noted, “When I was on an oral daily medication, I had to constantly carry my medication around with me. I wasn’t free to do things when I wanted, like taking a trip with my friends, and sometimes I forgot to take my medication. I knew that this wasn’t good and that I needed to make a change.”The change to a once-monthly injection has helped Tim get closer to accomplishing his goals, including embarking on a cross-country road trip with friends. “I’m freer to do the things I want to because I don’t have to worry about taking my medication every day,” Tim said.For Chrisa, knowing Tim will stay on track with his treatment plan while he’s traveling gives her more peace of mind: “With the long-acting injectable, that worry that he will forget to take his medication goes away completely. Now I can just worry like other moms about their son going on a guys’ road trip!”Despite their clinical benefits, it can take some time for individuals like Tim to be prescribed a long-acting injectable (LAI) after their initial diagnosis. Mental health advocacy groups are working to raise awareness about treatment options, including LAIs, to help adults and their loved ones make informed treatment decisions and advocate for the use of LAIs earlier in their treatment journey. Recently, the American Psychiatric Association released its updated Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia and the National Council for Behavioral Health issued their Guide to Long-Acting Medications for Providers and Organizations, which both discuss how LAIs can be used.“Having organizations like the American Psychiatric Association and the National Council for Behavioral Health bring forward information on treatment options is so important,” Chrisa noted. “All patients deserve to be fully informed about their treatment options.”If you or a loved one is an adult living with schizophrenia, ask your doctor if a change in treatment plan could make the difference for you. Learn more and take a quiz to find out if a once-monthly injection could be right for you at www.oncemonthlydifference.com.Every story is unique. If you are an adult living with schizophrenia, talk to your doctor to figure out a treatment plan that's right for you.Chrisa and Tim have partnered with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., to share their story. They have been paid an honorarium for their time."

            "body": "From tag-free boxer briefs and seamless bikinis to weightless cotton fabrics and moisture-wicking technology, there’s a go-to type of underwear for everyone. Influenced by notable pop culture moments and the evolving fashion industry, underwear styles have taken huge leaps throughout the years.Fruit of the Loom, an underwear brand for over 160 years, offers the following look at the pivotal transformations of underwear, one of the most essential pieces of clothing, that also makes a great gift.1920s: Creating flexible fits was vital for men’s and women’s undergarments. Inspired by the shorts worn by professional fighters, boxers, now one of the most common styles for men, were created to provide men and athletes with flexibility and freedom of movement. For women, an all-in-one revolutionary undergarment style, step-ins were introduced. Like the modern-day romper, step-ins are a one-piece undergarment that combines a camisole and bloomers, high-waisted loose cotton underpants.1930s to 1940s: Functionality was the dominant factor for men when selecting underwear during this era, while women focused on style. For colder months, union suits, like the modern-day “onesie,” evolved from the ones that emerged in the 1800s to provide men and women an extra layer of warmth. Then, a new type of underwear inspired by an iconic postcard of a model donning a bikini-style bathing suit broke through for men: the classic cotton briefs. These legless, cotton briefs, featured Y-fronts to allow better movement and all-day support.On the other hand, tight fitting corsets or girdles and decorative lingerie were popular among many women as they embraced shapewear, pulling inspiration from retro pin-up models.1960s to 1970s: Women continued to celebrate their bodies and personal styles, hence the game-changing bikini and thong. Named after two-piece swimsuits, the bikini featured a moderate rise and coverage to offer comfort and purchasing a pair that matched the bra became the epitome of counterculture fashion. As pin-up models and calendar girls turned into runway models, thongs entered the scene eliminating panty lines while offering a higher cut to reveal more hip and thigh.1990s: Comfort soon became a top priority as shoppers sought essential underwear for softness and durability. Combining the length of boxers and the snug fit of briefs, boxer briefs were introduced and soon became the most popular selection for men. Providing men with ventilation and support, the first boxer briefs included elastic waistbands for comfort. Seeking comfortable yet flattering options, boy shorts became popular for women as an alternative to a traditional slip.2000s to present day: With new technology continually evolving, underwear has changed and provided men and women with many options such as functionality, material, shape and design. Now more than ever, shoppers are seeking style, comfort and quality at great value. For example, Fruit of the Loom offers a wide selection of underwear styles for the entire family, one of the most notable is its Breathable underwear for men and women made of micro mesh fabric that promotes airflow to keep you cool. With moisture-wicking technology to distribute sweat away from the skin, the popular underwear is the go-to selection to keep you dry throughout the day.For more information, and a variety of gift ideas, visit Fruit.com."

            "body": "This year, New Year’s Eve celebrations might not look like they normally do. But that doesn’t mean you can’t still celebrate with family and friends! In fact, given how difficult this year has been, a party might be exactly what is needed. The good news is that there are plenty of fun, safe ways to ring in the new year as a family right from the comfort of your own home.Here are a few ideas for making your New Year’s Eve celebration a fun event for all:1) Have a dance party: With a little planning and spirit, any room can be transformed into a dance space. Turn on some tunes, get the family moving and raise the roof to ring in 2021. You could even turn off the lights and use glow sticks or LED light-up wands for added ambiance.2) Set up a photo booth: Make it a night to remember by setting up a photo booth for the kids to enjoy. Pick a corner, pull out old Halloween costumes or find some festive props, and let your kids get creative. The photos can be great to share on your social channels to wish friends a happy new year.3) Look through old photos or home movies: As we head into a new year, take a trip down memory lane by looking through old photos or watching home movies. This is sure to put a smile on everyone’s face and is a great reminder of how far they’ve come this past year.4) Create a family time capsule: Ask each family member to write down their wishes and dreams for 2021. Then, seal responses in a box or jar with other memorable items to open next New Year’s Eve.5) Board games, anyone? Get the family energized with a little competition. Find a few games everyone can enjoy or host a tournament of your family favorites. Consider giving out some fun prizes to keep everyone engaged.6) Glam up everyday objects: Kids love sparkle! Add glitter to playdough or slime and let them play. Use number cookie cutters to spell out 2021.7) DIY dessert bar: Set up a dessert bar, and let your kids create a confetti-themed treat with some pre-made cupcakes topped with frosting. Have a variety of confetti colored toppings, like sprinkles, decorating icing, and colorful Fruity Pebbles cereal or candy pieces, on hand for everyone to use to make their own masterpiece.8) Have a virtual hangout: Carve out some time and say hi to family and friends you haven’t been able to see. This is a great way to keep the kids occupied and get some face time with grandparents or others who might be isolated.9) Watch an early countdown: Nothing says New Year’s Eve like a good countdown. To help families everywhere ring in 2021, Pebbles cereal is hosting a New Year’s Eve countdown on Dec. 31, featuring Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble from Bedrock leading into the 9 p.m. EST hour during “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest 2021,” which airs live beginning at 8 p.m. EST on ABC. Tune in and join Fred and Barney for an epic countdown to 2021, which happens to be the cereal’s 50th birthday year.10) Make party favors: Pick up some party favors at a local store or better yet, make them at home. There are plenty of great tutorials online for fun party favors the kids will enjoy. Try your hand at making confetti poppers, a fun take on a celebration staple. What better way to ring in the new year than with some fun party poppers the kids will enjoy making and eating.Whatever you end up doing, don’t forget to take some time to reflect on this past year and celebrate the year to come. 10…9…8…7…6…5…4…3…2…1… Happy New Year!"

            "body": "Many of life’s interruptions can’t be predicted. Not having funds set aside for unexpected problems can leave you racking up high credit card debt or putting yourself in other difficult financial straits.“When it comes to savings best practices, it is especially clear after the pandemic how valuable an emergency savings fund can become at a moment’s notice,” said Jaspreet Chawla, Senior Vice President of Savings Products at Navy Federal Credit Union. “Here are some tips that might help you kick start your emergency savings.”Here’s how to create an emergency fund to protect your finances.1. Do the math; set a goal.If your first instinct is to save an enormous sum that will cover all expenses for many months, think again. While financial experts recommend having between three and six months of living expenses in an emergency fund, this number might not be realistic if you’re just beginning to save. It’s often a good idea to start with a smaller goal — $500 or $1,000. Then, as you get into the habit of saving, you can slowly start to raise your future goals until you reach the three-to six-month threshold.2. Decide where to put the funds.The money in your emergency fund should be kept separate from accounts you use for paying bills or making purchases and be easily accessible when an emergency arises. Using just one account may make it far too easy to “borrow” from your emergency fund for non-essential items. Instead, place your emergency funds into an interest-bearing account that’s specifically designated for this purpose. Good options include a savings account or money market account. Either can be easily accessed without penalties and allow your money to grow.3. Get creative and save.Building an emergency fund means you’ll need to trim spending elsewhere. Quick fixes like evaluating your cell phone plan, cutting the cord on cable or bringing your lunch to work can help free up money for savings. Or think bigger, like refinancing your home or car. Use a refinance calculator to see whether a new loan will save you money.4. Save unexpected windfalls.You can boost the balance of your emergency fund when you least expect it with “found” money. Invest birthday or holiday cash gifts, work bonuses and tax refunds directly into your account and see how quickly you can reach your emergency fund goal. Since this money isn’t part of your typical spending, it’s easy to use it for saving without missing it.5. Make saving automatic.We all know that saving money for the unexpected is a good idea, but it’s easy to delay in favor of more pressing concerns. Treat your emergency fund like any other monthly recurring bill and have funds directly deposited into your savings account each month. You’ll be less likely to miss the money and can sleep easy knowing you have a safety net when life interruptions occur.“We always try to emphasize the importance of savings and financial security, and we want to be a resource for our members when it comes to prepping for financial emergencies,” Chawla continued. “An emergency fund isn’t a luxury; it’s an important way to protect the things that matter most to you. I encourage you to talk to a financial institution you can trust, and get started saving as soon as you can.”"

Not having funds set aside for unexpected problems can leave you racking up high credit card debt or putting yourself in other difficult financial straits.</p><p>“When it comes to savings best practices, it is especially clear after the pandemic how valuable an emergency savings fund can become at a moment’s notice,” said Jaspreet Chawla, Senior Vice President of Savings Products at Navy Federal Credit Union. “Here are some tips that might help you kick start your emergency savings.”</p><p>Here’s how to create an emergency fund to protect your finances.</p><p><strong>1. Do the math; set a goal.</strong></p><p>If your first instinct is to save an enormous sum that will cover all expenses for many months, think again. While financial experts recommend having between three and six months of living expenses in an emergency fund, this number might not be realistic if you’re just beginning to save. It’s often a good idea to start with a smaller goal — $500 or $1,000. Then, as you get into the habit of saving, you can slowly start to raise your future goals until you reach the three-to six-month threshold.</p><p><strong>2. Decide where to put the funds.</strong></p><p>The money in your emergency fund should be kept separate from accounts you use for paying bills or making purchases and be easily accessible when an emergency arises. Using just one account may make it far too easy to “borrow” from your emergency fund for non-essential items. Instead, place your emergency funds into an interest-bearing account that’s specifically designated for this purpose. Good options include a <a href=\"https://www.navyfederal.org/products-services/checking-savings/savings.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">savings account</a> or <a href=\"https://www.navyfederal.org/products-services/checking-savings/money-market.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">money market account</a>. Either can be easily accessed without penalties and allow your money to grow.</p><p><strong>3. Get creative and save.</strong></p><p>Building an emergency fund means you’ll need to trim spending elsewhere. Quick fixes like evaluating your cell phone plan, cutting the cord on cable or bringing your lunch to work can help free up money for savings. Or think bigger, like refinancing your home or car. Use a <a href=\"https://www.navyfederal.org/calcs/shouldrefi.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">refinance calculator</a> to see whether a new loan will save you money.</p><p><strong>4. Save unexpected windfalls.</strong></p><p>You can boost the balance of your emergency fund when you least expect it with “found” money. Invest birthday or holiday cash gifts, work bonuses and tax refunds directly into your account and see how quickly you can reach your emergency fund goal. Since this money isn’t part of your typical spending, it’s easy to use it for saving without missing it.</p><p><strong>5. Make saving automatic.</strong></p><p>We all know that saving money for the unexpected is a good idea, but it’s easy to delay in favor of more pressing concerns. Treat your emergency fund like any other monthly recurring bill and have funds directly deposited into your savings account each month. You’ll be less likely to miss the money and can sleep easy knowing you have a safety net when life interruptions occur.</p><p>“We always try to emphasize the importance of savings and financial security, and we want to be a resource for our members when it comes to prepping for financial emergencies,” Chawla continued. “An emergency fund isn’t a luxury; it’s an important way to protect the things that matter most to you. I encourage you to talk to a financial institution you can trust, and get started saving as soon as you can.”</p>",

            "body": "Making the transition from military service to civilian life can be challenging on multiple fronts — and the toughest issue can be figuring out your next career move. Fortunately, there are plenty of resources available for veterans and military families coping with the job hunt, moving, handling their finances and more.As part of Navy Federal Credit Union’s continued effort to help our nation’s heroes get hired, the credit union conducted a recent webinar featuring top veteran employees offering useful advice for getting hired and moving forward in your life after military service. Bryant Luciano, Recruiter II and a Marine veteran, and Kerry A. Favero-Rivera, senior organization development consultant and executive coach, who is a Navy veteran, provide their tips for making the most of this transition.Start your job search earlyBoth Luciano and Favero-Rivera recommended beginning your job hunt immediately — not waiting until you start your transitioning classes. This will give you the time to figure out what you want to do after your transition and then actively pursue that career.Prepare yourself mentallyLooking for work, especially in a new field, is always daunting. “Understand that you will get rejected more often than not,” says Luciano, “And know that the job search is hard, but not impossible. Keep going, trust the process and rely on those around you like a transition officer or recruiter to help you navigate any challenges.”Use your networkFavero-Rivera emphasizes the importance of tapping into your own personal network throughout the process. “Everyone you know also knows others, so take advantage of that wider network,” she says. “Most people get jobs through word of mouth so by simply talking to others about what you’re looking for, you’re furthering your job search.” Start by telling everyone you know what kind of work you’re looking for, and your network will start to keep their eyes and ears open for you.Do your researchLuciano emphasizes using career-oriented websites for research, including Indeed® and Glassdoor®. Decide where you want to live and then explore companies and organizations in that area online. “Make a list of five companies you want to work for,” says Luciano. “Research those companies and find out what types of opportunities they have available.”You may need to find training opportunities or develop skills on the job as you transition into your ideal role. This will open doors to endless opportunities in the long-term. As you work your way to that ideal role, your experience will help you stand out. “Many companies prefer to hire from within,” confirms Favero-Rivera, “So it could make sense to start a job that only meets some of your needs, but long-term will be fulfilling and at a company you want to work for.

            "html": "<p>Making the transition from military service to civilian life can be challenging on multiple fronts — and the toughest issue can be figuring out your next career move. Fortunately, there are plenty of resources available for veterans and military families coping with the job hunt, moving, handling their finances and more.</p><p>As part of Navy Federal Credit Union’s continued effort to help our nation’s heroes get hired, the credit union conducted a <a href=\"https://register.gotowebinar.com/recording/viewRecording/1327112042627723533/1816984056059177743/nicole.gutierrez@clydegroup.com?registrantKey=5013233571673611790&amp;type=ATTENDEEEMAILRECORDINGLINK\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recent webinar</a> featuring top veteran employees offering useful advice for getting hired and moving forward in your life after military service. Bryant Luciano, Recruiter II and a Marine veteran, and Kerry A. Favero-Rivera, senior organization development consultant and executive coach, who is a Navy veteran, provide their tips for making the most of this transition.</p><p><strong>Start your job search early</strong></p><p>Both Luciano and Favero-Rivera recommended beginning your job hunt immediately — not waiting until you start your transitioning classes. This will give you the time to figure out what you want to do after your transition and then actively pursue that career.</p><p><strong>Prepare yourself mentally</strong></p><p>Looking for work, especially in a new field, is always daunting. “Understand that you will get rejected more often than not,” says Luciano, “And know that the job search is hard, but not impossible. Keep going, trust the process and rely on those around you like a transition officer or recruiter to help you navigate any challenges.”</p><p><strong>Use your network</strong></p><p>Favero-Rivera emphasizes the importance of tapping into your own personal network throughout the process. “Everyone you know also knows others, so take advantage of that wider network,” she says. “Most people get jobs through word of mouth so by simply talking to others about what you’re looking for, you’re furthering your job search.” Start by telling everyone you know what kind of work you’re looking for, and your network will start to keep their eyes and ears open for you.</p><p><strong>Do your research</strong></p><p>Luciano emphasizes using career-oriented websites for research, including Indeed<sup>®</sup> and Glassdoor<sup>®</sup>. Decide where you want to live and then explore companies and organizations in that area online. “Make a list of five companies you want to work for,” says Luciano. “Research those companies and find out what types of opportunities they have available.”</p><p>You may need to find training opportunities or develop skills on the job as you transition into your ideal role.

            "body": "Running a business is no small feat. Add to that the evolving uncertainties with COVID-19, protests, rioting, a recession and more, and any business is on high alert. Preparing for unknowns is difficult despite the organization's size, but it can be even more difficult for small and medium businesses.Whether you're running a booming startup with a network of teams, have a small business with a dedicated core of employees or are a solo act making your dream come true, it's important to be proactive during these challenging times. Here are three steps every business owner should take to ensure they are protected in the future:Step 1: Have a crisis action planWhat would happen if your store was ransacked during a riot? What would you do if someone broke into your business accounts? What if you or your employee was injured on the job? It's important to set up at minimum a basic crisis plan to deal with scenarios that could cause trauma to people and stress to your bottom line.Crisis plans are written procedures that serve as guidelines to follow when an incident occurs. They can include training information that's helpful to prepare for different situations. This also should include important contact information such as police and emergency numbers as well as insurance contact information.Step 2: Secure the right insuranceMany businesses struggle to get adequate coverage, especially liability coverage for unique situations. Consider contacting XINSURANCE, which provides insurance that other providers can't or won't. With more than 30 years of diversified underwriting experience for difficult risks in all 50 states, you'll find what you need.The company has a unique approach that provides all risks with a $10 million limit in-house, with higher limits available. They can offer an all-in-one policy that can include coverages such as property, general liability, professional and specialty liability including excess medical and commercial auto (available in most states). You'll be covered from frivolous lawsuits and won't have to worry about gaps or exclusions in your policy.From tow companies to amusement rental organizations to stunt performers and so much more, you'll get the coverage you need for any risk. This can include considerations for crisis situations as well, such as communicable disease liability coverage (including COVID-19), civil commotion liability coverage (such as riots and looting), active shooter liability coverage, and more. Learn more at www.xinsurance.com or call 877-585-2853.Step 3: Expect the unexpectedIf nothing else, 2020 has been the year to expect the unexpected. It's important that you be prepared for anything. In addition to being proactive with a crisis plan and ample insurance, you want to set money aside in an emergency fund should your business need to access it.Whether it's suddenly having to integrate PPE into your business procedures, adding layers of security to your digital platforms or having the funds to cover payroll if you need to suddenly halt production, having the resources to make it through a rainy day is essential, especially for small businesses that run tighter budgets and schedules.Being a business owner is a source of pride for many people. By taking these three steps, you'll ensure the wellness of the business and help it thrive for years to come."

            "body": "If you're a small-business owner — whether your business consists of just you and your spouse or a handful of employees — and you're emerging from the pandemic into your new normal, it may be time for you to think about setting up retirement accounts, not just for your employees, but for yourself, too. That may be a surprising statement, considering many small-business owners do not currently offer retirement benefits to their employees, let alone take the time to set up an account for themselves.There are myriad reasons why small-business owners put off saving for retirement, including investing every last dollar back into the business so funds for things like retirement weren't available, anticipating selling your business when you retire so there's no need to save now, and, a reason every business owner can relate to, there are just not enough hours in the day to think about it.But the reality is, it's easier than you think. A good financial advisor can explain the ins and outs of retirement accounts to you in an afternoon and help you decide on the plan that makes the most sense for you, your business, and your employees. Your retirement-age self will thank you, and offering those benefits will make it easier for you to hire and retain employees now, too.Until you make that appointment with your advisor, here's a primer in Small Business Retirement Account Options, 101.SEP (Simplified Employee Pension)A SEP is designed for self-employed individuals or small businesses, ideally with fewer than 25 employees. If you earn a self-employment income, you are allowed to save more for retirement using a SEP plan than a traditional IRA or Roth allows. A SEP is less complex and costly than a 401(k), allows employers to contribute larger amounts than a traditional or Roth IRA, and may qualify for larger tax deductions.SIMPLE IRA (Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees)A SIMPLE IRA is ideally suited as a start-up retirement savings plan for small employers who have 100 or fewer employees, and who are not sponsoring a retirement plan. Contributions are tax-deductible, and earnings within the account are tax-free until withdrawn.Solo 401(k)A Solo 401(k) is for those who are self-employed and offers the same benefits of a regular 401(k), but it is designated for a business in which only the owner (and their spouse) is an employee. You can choose to make after-tax salary deferrals (adding a Roth component), with the tax advantages of withdrawals being tax-free when the time comes.The power of self-directed accountsWhat's the difference between a traditional and self-directed 401(k) or IRA? Where you're allowed to put those investment dollars. Especially in uncertain economic times like the ones we're living through right now, that choice couldn't be more important. With a self-directed 401(k), you can invest beyond the stock market.So, if not the stock market, where do you put those dollars? With a self-directed 401(k), you can choose from many different areas, including:Real estatePrivate debt like corporate debt offerings, notes secured by deeds of trust or mortgagesPrivate equity like stock of C-corporations, limited partnerships, LLCs, and REITsPrecious metals, including gold, silver, platinum, and palladiumCryptocurrency like BitcoinWhy self-directed accounts are so attractive to investorsThe beauty of this type of retirement investing isn't just about having options other than the stock market. It's about following your passions and using your own expertise to guide your investments. Let's say you're a real estate agent. You know the market extremely well. With a self-directed account, you can put your knowledge and your dollars together in a tax-advantaged way.It's also about paving the way for what you want to do after retirement. For that same real estate agent, it means retiring from selling properties and living on the income from the ones he or she owns via these investments. Equity Trust Company has seen investors use their knowledge of medical technology sales to fund their retirements and people involved in home restoration tie their retirement to the activity of their business.Whatever retirement account option is right for you, investing now means peace of mind later for yourself and for your employees.

            "body": "The job hunt after college is exhilarating and emotional while at the same time stressful and exhausting. Adding a global pandemic into the mix threatens to upend the process for the nearly 4 million 2020 graduates.For recent graduates, the disruption to the hiring and internship experience has brought unexpected challenges and adversity, and tested their ability to persevere.Some internships have been canceled or pushed back and job offers have been rescinded as companies have frozen hiring to lessen the financial burden brought on by the pandemic. Travel bans are restricting graduates from taking jobs across borders and graduates are faced with fewer job openings and increased competition for those jobs. These are just some of the added roadblocks new graduates are facing in 2020.At the same time, many companies are pivoting to virtual interviews and networking events and, in some instances, entire internships have gone remote.With remote jobs and internships comes new challenges for students and grads to overcome. Kristen Wahl, director of the EcoCAR Mobility Challenge and the Advanced Vehicle Technology Competition program at Argonne National Laboratory, has helped thousands of students land jobs post-college during her 20-plus years leading the program.Here are a few tips from Wahl for landing that first job in the COVID-19 era:Use the virtual tools at your disposal to network with recruiters. With in-person events off the table this fall, jobseekers need to seek alternative methods for making the connections that previously would have happened at career fairs. Reach out to your network on LinkedIn and other recruiting platforms. Email the professional contacts you’ve made through industry organizations or extracurricular activities. Pick up the phone and call recruiters to learn more about an open position. It’s all about taking the extra step to stand out from the crowd when first impressions are no longer face-to-face.Take advantage of virtual recruiting fairs and career prep sessions. Is your school hosting a virtual career fair? Is the student organization you’re a member of bringing in a guest speaker for a virtual chat? Identify the many opportunities available to connect with potential employers and use them to make connections. To stand out from the crowd, you’ll need to be an active participant. Ask questions. Share thoughts. Contribute to the conversation. Don’t be afraid to speak up, but also make sure you do your research on the company first.At EcoCAR, we identified ways to connect students with prospective employers. We quickly ramped up virtual recruiting webinars and career prep sessions, continued facilitating personal introductions and industry mentoring opportunities and revised our recruiting tools to better match talent with relevant positions.And finally, practice your virtual personal sales pitch and refine your digital professional presence to reflect all you have to offer. Make sure your LinkedIn and portfolio highlight your experiences and skills. Go beyond just sharing your degree information and articulate your value proposition. This includes showcasing your out-of-the-classroom experiences, leadership training, previous internships, as well as describing times you overcame adversity.Recruiters want problem solvers and critical thinkers. They want someone who will pick up a new skill quickly and learn fast. So, instead of looking at the pandemic as a setback on your job search journey, view it as an opportunity to demonstrate you possess these qualities and are right for the job.Good luck!"

Identify the many opportunities available to connect with potential employers and use them to make connections. To stand out from the crowd, you’ll need to be an active participant. Ask questions. Share thoughts. Contribute to the conversation. Don’t be afraid to speak up, but also make sure you do your research on the company first.</p><p>At EcoCAR, we identified ways to connect students with prospective employers. We quickly ramped up virtual recruiting webinars and career prep sessions, continued facilitating personal introductions and industry mentoring opportunities and revised our recruiting tools to better match talent with relevant positions.</p><p>And finally, <strong>practice your virtual personal sales pitch and refine your digital professional presence</strong> to reflect all you have to offer. Make sure your LinkedIn and portfolio highlight your experiences and skills. Go beyond just sharing your degree information and articulate your value proposition. This includes showcasing your out-of-the-classroom experiences, leadership training, previous internships, as well as describing times you overcame adversity.</p><p>Recruiters want problem solvers and critical thinkers. They want someone who will pick up a new skill quickly and learn fast. So, instead of looking at the pandemic as a setback on your job search journey, view it as an opportunity to demonstrate you possess these qualities and are right for the job.</p><p>Good luck!</p>",

When it comes to selecting a plan, one size does not fit all. Whether you are selecting a plan for the first time or evaluating how well your current plan is meeting your needs, take the time to understand and compare plans. A good first step is to make sure you understand health insurance lingo, such as premium, deductible, coinsurance and out-of-pocket maximum. If you need a refresher, check out the Health Care ABCs. If you’re of Medicare age, ensure you’re familiar with the difference between Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage by checking out medicaremadeclear.com as you weigh your options.Tip 2: Take advantage of a plan that offers telehealth visits and other resources to help you navigate health from home. An increasingly popular health care choice, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, has been telehealth or virtual visits, which enable people to connect 24/7 with a health care provider via a smartphone, tablet or personal computer. It’s designed to be an easier, more affordable way to talk to a doctor about common health issues. Often, telehealth is available to members of employer-sponsored, individual and Medicare Advantage plans.Tip 3: Review plan benefits that can help you save money, like wellness incentives. Many health plans now offer financial incentives that reward you for taking healthier actions, such as completing a health survey, exercising or avoiding nicotine. Many plans, including Medicare Advantage plans, offer gym memberships and wellness programs for members at no additional cost.Tip 4: Anticipate next year’s health expenses. If you are expecting a significant health event in the next year, such as a surgery or the birth of a child, you should compare the differences between plan designs, including out-of-pocket maximums.Tip 5: Consider a plan that offers health care advocates and resources to help you make the most of your benefits. Health care can be complicated, so no one should have to go it alone. It’s important to pick a plan that will provide you with access to advocates who help you navigate the health care system, find opportunities for cost savings and improve your health care experiences.For example, UnitedHealthcare advocates can proactively identify potential health risks and reach out to individuals and recommend clinical interventions and well-being programs. Advocates help individuals make better choices by explaining options and costs and guiding them to quality providers and the appropriate care settings.For more helpful health care articles and videos, visit UHCOpenEnrollment.com."

            "body": "One of the many changes spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic is a fundamental shift in how people are paying for the goods and services they need. Due to both health and safety concerns, consumers and retailers are more frequently choosing credit cards for online and in-person payments in an effort to make transactions as contactless as possible. Moreover, the pandemic has caused a national coin shortage, causing retailers to prefer and, at times, even require the use of a card instead of cash.If you’ve avoided using credit cards or feel worried about overusing them, now is an opportunity to rethink your spending strategy. If used smartly, they can be considered one of many effective tools to help you manage your money better.Here are some pros and cons of using credit cards instead of cash and tips for avoiding the pitfalls from the experts at Navy Federal Credit Union.Pros:Boost your credit. Using your credit cards on a regular basis may be a great way to improve your credit score. Not maxing out cards and paying your bills on time shows lenders that you can borrow responsibly, which can help you get better interest rates when you need to make big purchases such as a car or home.Earn rewards. Many credit cards offer rewards on everyday purchases like groceries, gas, and take-out. Some cards also offer a sign-up bonus, such as $150, when you spend $2,000 in the first three months, even on purchases you were already planning to make. This is an easy way to earn rewards and let your regular purchases add up in your favor. According to Justin Zeidman, head of credit card products at Navy Federal, “the best credit cards give you flexibility both in the way you earn and in the way you redeem.” Find a card that offers either extra cashback or rewards points on everyday purchases like groceries, restaurants and gas.Track your spending. If you’re trying to stick to a budget, it’s easy to track purchases made with a credit card, especially using mobile apps that update your purchases in real time. If you’ve ever lost track of cash in your purse or wallet, not remembering what you spent it on, a credit card can help you solve this problem and better understand your spending habits, by telling you exactly where your money’s going.Better protection. You have complete protection if your card is ever lost or stolen. Not only that, but credit cards offer protection against fraud if someone uses your number for an unauthorized purchase. Some cards also offer safeguards against buying damaged or faulty products. “If you think your card is lost or stolen, report it to your financial institution immediately,” said Zeidman. “When you’re on the phone with your issuer, explain to them the full extent of your situation. They'll walk you through next steps such as filing a claim to dispute any unauthorized transactions.”Cons:Missing payments.If you’re not good at remembering deadlines, it can hurt you. Missing or late credit card payments can have a negative impact on your credit score.The solution: “One of the easiest ways to stay on top of your credit card payment is to set up automatic payments,' says Zeidman. “Set it and forget it,” he added. If you can, pay the full amount each month, or at least more than the minimum amount, to minimize interest accumulating.Finally, during a time when health and safety are paramount, in addition to convenience and value, credit cards with contactless capabilities can offer consumers more safety and peace of mind. When used responsibly, not only can they help you to boost your credit and earn rewards, cards with contactless technology allow you to make everyday purchases without having to fumble with card systems other people have been touching. While the increase in contactless payments among American consumers has been slower compared to other parts of the world, COVID-19 has accelerated credit card usage in the U.S., and that’s a trend expected to continue after the pandemic has subsided.COVID-19 has resulted in many changes, and as Americans reevaluate their finances in economically uncertain times, they should be sure to look in their wallets and understand how they pay for everyday purchases. As everyone’s situation is unique, make sure to carefully weigh the pros and cons of any big financial decisions. That said, there is a great opportunity for many Americans to make sure their credit cards are working for them, their rewards are maximized, and they’re staying safe."

            "body": "The COVID-19 pandemic has hit many people hard financially. From furloughs to job loss and from strict budgets to depleted savings and much more, people are making adjustments as needed. It's important to stay focused on your financial well-being and take simple steps so you can recover and thrive in the future.'Many people who have experienced financial disruption need some help to get their savings back on track,' says Andy Harmening, Consumer and Business Banking director at Huntington. 'Even in a strong economy, managing everyday finances can be stressful. Fortunately, with a little diligence and some digital tools that make it easier to save, people can find the financial peace of mind they’re looking for.”Harmening says it is possible to improve your finances in a post-COVID world by focusing on three key areas:Create an updated, agile budgetYour income may change, so it's important to understand your spending habits and create a realistic budget. Track all your spending for a month and separate out necessities versus nice-to-have items. You can also input your income and expenses and let an online budget calculator do the math.Keep in mind variables due to the pandemic that may impact your budget. For example, a shorter work week, lower gas prices, more money on groceries and perhaps less money eating out. You'll want to incorporate these positive and negative changes, and if possible, leave some wiggle room for future changes. Additionally, some things like gym memberships and parking passes may have paused when the pandemic started but are now being charged again. Sophisticated online banking solutions, such as a spend analysis tool, can give you an eye-opening look into how your spending adds up so you can make smart adjustments.Replenish emergency funds with smart toolsMany people have tapped or even drained their savings to make ends meet as the pandemic hit. By updating your budget and getting ahead of spending, you can start to replenish emergency funds. Saving even a small amount regularly can help create an emergency fund that will put you in a better position to handle the potential of future financial challenges.Small amounts over time — even just $5 — can add up to a robust emergency fund that provides peace of mind. Money Scout by Huntington is a new tool customers can enroll in that analyzes spending habits, income, and upcoming expenses and finds money you’re not using in your checking account. Then, it moves that money, from $5 to $50, automatically to your savings, up to three times a week. Bit by bit, it will help you build savings.Automate bills and pay down debtTo keep your credit healthy, take steps to pay your bills on time and start reducing debt. A good first step is to automate wherever possible. Direct deposits and automatic bill payments ensure nothing gets overlooked or falls through the cracks in spending and saving.If you’ve leaned on your credit cards during the pandemic, pay down the debt with the larger interest rate first to avoid wasting dollars on paying interest, even if that means paying smaller debts first. This will help you save money in the long run.Keep in mind, it can be tempting to tap into money set aside in a retirement plan to cover expenses, but even if that can be done without a penalty, it can rob you of potential financial security down the road. If you need to pause contributing to a retirement plan temporarily to get finances back on track, that's OK. But avoid borrowing from these accounts and start contributing to them as soon as you're able to set yourself up for a bright financial future."

Saving even a small amount regularly can help create an emergency fund that will put you in a better position to handle the potential of future financial challenges.</p><p>Small amounts over time — even just $5 — can add up to a robust emergency fund that provides peace of mind. <a href=\"https://www.huntington.com/Personal/online-banking/money-scout\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Money Scout</a> by Huntington is a new tool customers can enroll in that analyzes spending habits, income, and upcoming expenses and finds money you’re not using in your checking account. Then, it moves that money, from $5 to $50, automatically to your savings, up to three times a week. Bit by bit, it will help you build savings.</p><p><strong>Automate bills and pay down debt</strong></p><p>To keep your credit healthy, take steps to pay your bills on time and start reducing debt. A good first step is to automate wherever possible. Direct deposits and automatic bill payments ensure nothing gets overlooked or falls through the cracks in spending and saving.</p><p>If you’ve leaned on your credit cards during the pandemic, pay down the debt with the larger interest rate first to avoid wasting dollars on paying interest, even if that means paying smaller debts first. This will help you save money in the long run.</p><p>Keep in mind, it can be tempting to tap into money set aside in a retirement plan to cover expenses, but even if that can be done without a penalty, it can rob you of potential financial security down the road. If you need to pause contributing to a retirement plan temporarily to get finances back on track, that's OK. But avoid borrowing from these accounts and start contributing to them as soon as you're able to set yourself up for a bright financial future.</p><p></p>",

            "body": "It’s not surprising that many small businesses are struggling to maintain operations, earn profits and sustain their work forces in the wake of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.However, many minorities who own small businesses across the U.S. remain more optimistic about the future than their non-diverse counterparts, though they acknowledge a need for greater support from the government from their communities and from the private sector.Those were some of the findings of the nationwide Small Business Mindshift 2020 survey recently completed by Union Bank, a financial institution that’s been serving small businesses on the West Coast for more than 155 years.The survey determined that in the U.S., 34% of minority small-business owners (SBOs) can “see a path forward” for future business success and survival despite COVID-19. In comparison, only 20% of non-diverse SBOs are predicting such outcomes. Minority SBOs have also been comparatively more proactive than their peers in forming new strategies to cope with pandemic-imposed changes. In fact, 24% believe COVID-19 has had a positive effect on their businesses, compared to just 12% of non-diverse SBOs. Minority SBOs include those owned by Black, Latinx and Asian respondents.“These survey findings reinforce what we already know — minority small businesses have always worked hard despite difficult circumstances or external environments — and as a result, have consistently been more resilient and adaptable,” said Frank Robinson, Diverse Markets and Community-Based Programs Executive for Union Bank. “Minority small businesses are at the heart and soul of their local communities, and as such, we are committed to helping them recover and thrive by providing them added support through critical economic stability and the tools necessary to succeed moving forward.”In other findings from the bank’s latest survey:U.S. minority SBOs are better at adapting their business strategiesIn general, U.S. minority SBOs have shown significantly more innovation than others when it comes to adjusting business practices to stay afloat; 52% have altered products or services, 50% have changed online retail options and 47% have switched their online advertising messaging.California-based SBOs are struggling, but minority owners are more optimisticSBOs in California are feeling more deflated and uncertain compared to other small business owners across the U.S. Only 13% of California small business owners say they see a path forward for how their business can survive versus 23% U.S. SBOs overall. Additionally, 41% said that applying for the financial aid that could help their businesses is too complex to even attempt.Again, however, minority SBOs in California have demonstrated more innovation and optimism during this time and have been more likely than their peers to implement new strategies. Not only are minority SBOs in California more likely to have embraced their community leadership roles — with 55% feeling an increased sense of responsibility to help their community vs. 44% of non-diverse SBOs — but they’re also getting more support in return, with 39% feeling supported by their local community vs. 33% of non-diverse SBOs.COVID-19 vaccine key to successA third of U.S. small-business owners said their future success and survival will be determined by the Presidential election, and two in three see the 2020 election as the most important in their time as business owners. However, the overwhelming majority said that the availability (or lack thereof) of a COVID-19 vaccine will be the No. 1 issue affecting their success over the next six months.As a way of supporting minority businesses and helping to address social and racial injustices in the U.S., Union Bank took the initiative in June to launch a $10 million Community Recovery Program aimed at providing SBOs access to capital, entrepreneurship, job retention and retraining.“This pandemic has hit all small businesses, and particularly minority owned small businesses, extremely hard,” said Todd Hollander, Head of Business Banking and Small Business for Union Bank. “But every day, we see our clients finding creative ways to keep their doors open and their employees paid. We are here to support them in those efforts both as a bank and as members of our local communities.”More information about Union Bank’s Community Recovery Program is available at UnionBank.com/about-us/newsroom/community-recovery-program."

In April, the Food-at-Home Consumer Price Index increased 2.7%, which was the largest monthly jump since 1974. From June 2019 to June 2020, food prices are up 5.6%. Why is this happening, and furthermore, how can you save on your family’s grocery bills?The food supply chain and price fluctuationsThe food supply chain is made up of three parts: production, processing, and retail.

Sometimes there are shocks to the food supply chain that have big influences on prices, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.COVID-19 factors’ influence on food prices As communities quickly responded to the COVID-19 pandemic, every stage of the food supply chain saw costs increase. There are four key trends that are influencing food costs:Shift to eating at home: In a matter of two months, approximately $23 billion in consumer spending away from home was redirected toward grocery stores as restaurants were forced to close due to COVID-19, according to FMI — The Food Industry Association.Loss of foodservice demand: When restaurants closed, farmers and ranchers lost a key channel for their product. With fewer buyers, it is costly or impractical to harvest, preserve or store some food and beverage products.Increasing production and processing costs: During COVID-19, companies have made investments and adjustments to safeguard their products and employees. This means costs for food production are higher. Some manufacturers have been able to innovate and find new markets for their products, but these changes often entail added costs.Increasing operating costs for grocery stores: Compared to 2019, supermarket operating costs were up 7.9% in April 2020 and 6.7% in May 2020, according to USDA Economic Research Service. Grocery stores have remained open during the pandemic and have had to quickly adjust to new regulations, safety and sanitation practices and enhanced customer education — all requiring resources.

Use a shopping list or app to help stay organized. Check your store’s circular, website or app for coupons and specials ahead of time.Compare options: Consider purchasing store brands, usually priced less and with equal taste and nutrition. When possible, purchase bulk protein options for freezing extras. Compare unit prices of different brands and package sizes to save.

            "body": "Since the pandemic began, many have felt the effects on their mental health. The CDC reported in June that over 40% of Americans suffered an adverse mental or behavioral health condition, with anxiety and depressive disorders topping the list. By mid-July, 53% of U.S. adults said their mental health was negatively impacted by stress and worry due to the pandemic, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll. As the pandemic continues, these stressors are likely to impact more people every day.Are you or your family members likely to suffer from anxiety, depression or other mental health issues? If so, what can you do to support your — or your loved one's — mental health?First, it helps to uncover your predisposition toward certain traits or mental conditions. Just as you might seek information about your genetic predisposition for illnesses to guide your lifestyle choices, discovering your genetic traits related to mental health can help support your emotional well-being.Thanks to a breakthrough in the translation of genetic mechanisms and traits that can influence a person’s behavioral predispositions, the Genomind Mental Health Map provides a springboard anyone can use to take action toward better mental wellness. Mental health is a function of genetics, environment, lifestyle and experiences. This is called “Mental Health 360.”Dr. Scott Wiener, a board-certified psychiatrist focused on a biological based holistic approach, uses genetic information as a vital tool. “For far too long the practice of psychiatry has only utilized symptoms in the assessment of someone’s mental health. Evolving science has now given us the opportunity to assess the biological causes underlying those symptoms,” says Wiener. “Genomind is an essential tool in this advanced process of creating a more complete picture of mental health.”Unlike some ancestry tests that have a spit tube for collection, you only supply a cheek swab sample for Genomind’s test. They then analyze 38 genetic variants and influences on 29 mental health traits, resulting in a report detailing 59 possible behavioral predispositions specific to your genetic profile. Genomind provides resources and recommended actions from trusted advocacy groups to help improve your wellness and quality of life.The Genomind Mental Health Map identifies 7 Core Genetic Mental Health Capabilities:1. Stress and anxiety2. Mood3. Focus and memory4. Sleep5. Eating behavior6. Social behavior7. Habits and substance useExploring your genetic predispositions in these seven crucial areas increases your self-awareness and empowers you to take steps toward better self-care.Stress and anxietyIf you are one of many who have the variant of the gene involved in stress hormone regulation (FKBP5), you may experience a heightened stress response.Knowing that this variant may contribute to your stress response allows you to target this biological mechanism to help regulate it. For example, supplements such as magnesium and/or rhodiola rosea have been shown to help.

            "html": "<p>Since the pandemic began, many have felt the effects on their mental health. The CDC reported in June that over 40% of Americans suffered an adverse mental or behavioral health condition, with anxiety and depressive disorders topping the list. By mid-July, 53% of U.S. adults said their mental health was negatively impacted by stress and worry due to the pandemic, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll. As the pandemic continues, these stressors are likely to impact more people every day.</p><p>Are you or your family members likely to suffer from anxiety, depression or other mental health issues? If so, what can you do to support your — or your loved one's — mental health?</p><p>First, it helps to uncover your predisposition toward certain traits or mental conditions. Just as you might seek information about your genetic predisposition for illnesses to guide your lifestyle choices, discovering your genetic traits related to mental health can help support your emotional well-being.</p><p>Thanks to a breakthrough in the translation of genetic mechanisms and traits that can influence a person’s behavioral predispositions, the <a href=\"https://mentalhealthmap.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Genomind Mental Health Map</a> provides a springboard anyone can use to take action toward better mental wellness. Mental health is a function of genetics, environment, lifestyle and experiences. This is called “Mental Health 360.”</p><p>Dr. Scott Wiener, a board-certified psychiatrist focused on a biological based holistic approach, uses genetic information as a vital tool. “For far too long the practice of psychiatry has only utilized symptoms in the assessment of someone’s mental health. Evolving science has now given us the opportunity to assess the biological causes underlying those symptoms,” says Wiener. “Genomind is an essential tool in this advanced process of creating a more complete picture of mental health.”</p><p>Unlike some ancestry tests that have a spit tube for collection, you only supply a cheek swab sample for Genomind’s test. They then analyze 38 genetic variants and influences on 29 mental health traits, resulting in a report detailing 59 possible behavioral predispositions specific to your genetic profile. Genomind provides resources and recommended actions from trusted advocacy groups to help improve your wellness and quality of life.<br><br><strong>The Genomind Mental Health Map identifies 7 Core Genetic Mental Health Capabilities:</strong></p><p>1. Stress and anxiety</p><p>2. Mood</p><p>3. Focus and memory</p><p>4. Sleep</p><p>5. Eating behavior</p><p>6. Social behavior</p><p>7. Habits and substance use</p><p>Exploring your genetic predispositions in these seven crucial areas increases your self-awareness and empowers you to take steps toward better self-care.</p><p><strong>Stress and anxiety</strong></p><p>If you are one of many who have the variant of the gene involved in stress hormone regulation (FKBP5), you may experience a heightened stress response.</p><p>Knowing that this variant may contribute to your stress response allows you to target this biological mechanism to help regulate it. For example, supplements such as magnesium and/or rhodiola rosea have been shown to help. You can also try mindfulness techniques like grounding exercises and meditation.</p><p><strong>Sleep and focus</strong></p><p>Or you may find you have a variant of the gene associated with excessive brain cell signaling (CACNA1C), which can result in traits such as:</p><p>You can target this mechanism with supplements shown to stabilize it, like omega-3 fatty acids and magnesium.

            "body": "You’ve probably heard the buzz about probiotics helping to support gut health for humans — but did you know that probiotics can also help support the health of your pet? It turns out that both dogs and cats can benefit from probiotics as a regular part of their overall healthy, nutrient-rich diet.How do probiotics work?The intestines contain billions of bacteria that are collectively called the “microbiome.” When an imbalance exists in the microbiome, it can cause digestive upset, leading to unpleasant symptoms — including excess gas or loose stool.That's where probiotics come in. Probiotics are live, beneficial bacteria that help promote balance in the intestines — for humans and animals alike.As senior research nutritionist at Purina, Dr. Gail Czarnecki-Maulden, PhD, explains, “Probiotics decrease the pH in the gut and help the good gut bacteria thrive.'What are all the benefits of probiotics?In addition to helping the good bacteria thrive to reduce digestive problems in dogs and cats, probiotics also offer other benefits. One key benefit is that probiotics can support immune health.“Most of our immune system is located in the digestive tract,” says Czarnecki-Maulden. “This creates lots of opportunities for the good bacteria to interact with immune cells and support immune health.”Another benefit is connected to dogs displaying anxious behavior. A specific probiotic strain, found in Calming Care from Purina Pro Plan Veterinary Supplements, has been shown effective in helping dogs maintain calm behavior and cope with external stressors like separation, unfamiliar visitors, novel sounds, or changes in routine and location.What are the long-term effects of taking probiotics?Some probiotics work faster than others, and the long-term effects may also vary, depending on the strain of probiotics and what it is being used for.According to Czarnecki-Maulden, it can take anywhere from one or two days to several weeks to see results from probiotics given to your pets — and it depends on the specific probiotic strain and its intended benefit.How can you choose the right probiotic for your pet?There are several different options when it comes to probiotics for your animal companion. Some probiotics come in the form of a supplement, while others are added to pet food to provide their benefits through your pet’s diet. For example, nearly all Purina Pro Plan formulas for dogs and cats are now fortified with probiotics for digestive and immune health. Pro Plan offers a full spectrum of performance and specialized nutrition formulas, including options that support healthy aging, help with canine cognition and more. Every ingredient is carefully chosen for a specific purpose, and the nutrition is backed by over 500 scientists including nutritionists, behaviorists and veterinarians.Regardless of the form of the probiotic, “It’s important to choose the right probiotic for your specific need,” Czarnecki-Maulden adds. “Some probiotics are good for digestive health or addressing digestive upset. Some help support the immune system.”Along with the right probiotic strain, the number of “live” bacteria also matters. Regardless of the probiotic selected and used, the product must contain an efficacious amount to exert its positive health benefits for the pet.While probiotics do offer numerous benefits, they aren’t suitable for every pet or for every situation. In some circumstances, like for animals with a significantly compromised GI tract or who may be undergoing treatments like chemotherapy, the decision to start probiotics should be made only with your veterinarian's advice.“We’re just beginning to scratch the surface of what probiotics can do for our pets, as well as the importance of the intestinal microbiome,' says Czarnecki-Maulden. 'It’s an exciting area that is now getting a lot more attention. I am hopeful we will have even more understanding of what probiotics can do in the near future.”To make decisions about the best nutrition for your pet, you should always consult your veterinarian."

However, you may be less familiar with how you can help protect yourself against other vaccine-preventable respiratory diseases like pneumococcal pneumonia.“Pneumococcal pneumonia is the most common bacterial pneumonia occurring in adults. It is a serious disease, which can take you out of your routine for weeks and in serious cases, lead to hospitalization,” said Dr. Vincenza Snow, Senior Medical Director for Vaccines, US Medical Affairs Lead at Pfizer. “In fact, those 65 and older are over 10 times more likely than individuals aged 18 to 49 to be hospitalized for this potentially life-threatening illness.”The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that adults 65 or older talk to their healthcare provider about whether vaccination against pneumococcal pneumonia is right for them. Dr. Snow addressed some common questions about the disease and vaccination:Q: Is pneumococcal pneumonia the same as the flu?Dr. Snow: The flu is caused by a virus, while pneumococcal pneumonia is a bacterial lung infection. They can have similar symptoms, but the most common ones associated with pneumococcal pneumonia are coughing, difficulty breathing, excessive sweating, shaking chills, high fever, and/or chest pain. Even after symptoms subside, fatigue and other physical effects can be felt for weeks afterward.Q: Can it only be caught during the fall or winter? Dr. Snow: Pneumococcal pneumonia is spread through coughing or close contact and can be contracted at any time of the year.Q: I’m healthy. Do I need vaccination against pneumococcal pneumonia?Dr. Snow: As we age, our immune systems naturally weaken, making us more susceptible to disease. That’s true even for those who are young at heart, live active lifestyles, and take excellent care of themselves. That’s partly why adults 65 and older are more likely to be hospitalized from pneumococcal pneumonia than younger adults. Further, the risk of pneumococcal pneumonia is greater if you smoke or suffer from chronic conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, heart disease, or diabetes.Q: Can pneumococcal pneumonia be contracted from pneumococcal vaccination?Dr. Snow: You cannot catch pneumococcal pneumonia from vaccination, as it contains no live bacteria. The CDC recommends vaccination as the most effective way to protect yourself against the disease.Q: Should I get vaccinated?Dr. Snow: Flu season is a good time to talk to your healthcare provider about recommended adult vaccinations, including those that help protect against pneumococcal pneumonia. There are states that do allow you to receive pneumococcal vaccination without a prescription at your local pharmacy or public health center.For more information about immunization and vaccination options for adults 65 and older, talk to your doctor or go to www.cdc.gov or www.KnowPneumonia.com."

Whether you’re shopping online or in store, these tips can help you spend less and set you up for long-term financial success.Know when to use credit or debit.“The answer to this depends on your individual financial situation,” said Shazia Virji, Vice President at Credit Sesame. “Purchasing items with cash or a debit card can help prevent you from overspending or going deeper into debt, but paying with credit now allows you to save your cash for expenses that don’t allow you to pay with credit, like rent or loan payments.” If you have a credit card that offers reward programs, you may benefit from the additional points and discounts during the holiday shopping season. One of the potential downsides to using your credit is that you may rack up more debt. If you aren’t in a position to pay your entire balance each month, you’ll likely end up paying more in interest over time.“Your cash and credit are intertwined when it comes to your overall financial health, so it’s important to find a balance between using the two,” said Virji. “In fact, Credit Sesame helps emphasize the relationship between the two by rewarding customers with cash rewards when they improve their credit score.”Be aware of the downsides of retailer credit cards.If you’ve shopped at a major retail chain or department store, you’ve likely been asked if you want to save 10 percent on your purchase by applying for their credit card. Before you apply for any credit card, there are a few factors to keep in mind. First, you should make sure that you could pay off the balance in a timely manner.“Oftentimes, retailer credit cards have higher interest rates and could cost you more in the long run if you don’t pay them off in full,” said Virji. Another consideration is whether you’d benefit from the perks of having this store credit card. If this is a store you shop at frequently and would use the bonus points and discounts, then it may be a good option for you. It’s also important to keep in mind that applying for any credit card may temporarily lower your credit score with a hard inquiry.Free shipping doesn’t always pay off.You’ve found the exact gift you're looking for online, and you’re ready to check out. Unfortunately, you’re about $15 short of the minimum total to qualify for free shipping.“Don’t feel pressured to throw another item in your cart just to save $5.99 on shipping charges,” said Virji. “Chances are, you’ll end up spending more than you’d save in free shipping for something you didn’t need. If you’re shopping from multiple online stores, adding a few things here and there can really add up and blow your budget.” Instead, try to match up your shopping list to retailers offering promotions that don’t require a minimum purchase. Your credit or debit card may also provide exclusive discounts, like Credit Sesame’s Cash Back Offers, where you can receive up to 15 percent instant cash back from thousands of national and local retailers on qualifying purchases.“Remember, you don’t need to jeopardize your financial health to show your loved ones that you care this holiday season,” said Virji. “By managing your cash and credit together and sticking to a budget, you can buy quality gifts and keep your debt at bay.”"

In fact, 55% of fall 2020 travelers are booking two to five nights when vacationing, and 36% are booking one-night stays, according to a recent Tripadvisor survey.Worry and expense associated with airline travel also has many people opting for destinations within driving distance of home. The traditional road trip is seeing a resurgence as people are packing up their vehicles to enjoy the drive to nearby adventures, whether that takes them to the country or a metropolitan area — or anything in between.Extra space to play and social distanceThe ability to spread out and be physically distant from others while enjoying time as a family is a top trend. People are seeking destinations with room to enjoy and space to play, both indoors and out. This might be renting a cabin and hiking the great outdoors or booking a room at a large resort with ample room so you're not uncomfortably close to other guests.Kalahari has four locations that fit the bill, with the new location in Round Rock, Texas, taking the title of America’s Largest Indoor Waterpark Resort, which has 1.5 million square feet of space to play, which means lots of opportunity for fun while prioritizing social distancing and safety. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has found no evidence that COVID-19 is spread through recreational waters, so feel free to enjoy the 223,000 square feet of indoor waterpark that includes 20 pools, 30 waterslides and 3 acres of outdoor pools.Enhanced safety proceduresTop of mind for all travelers, safety is essential. Many destinations and resorts are prioritizing keeping guests safe with new procedures, like contactless and cash-free methods of payment, offering remote check-in and implementing a wellness concierge to monitor and communicate safety initiatives to guests.Research the offerings at different accommodations and choose the one that you feel most comfortable with. Ask about the option to forgo cleaning service for the duration of the stay if you prefer no one enter the hotel room, with the option of fresh towels and toiletries to be delivered safely outside the door for convenience.Experiences and activities are prioritiesQuarantine, sheltering in place, remote working and virtual learning: people have been spending a lot of time at home, so when they are traveling they want to prioritize unique experiences to make meaningful memories as a family. Because many theaters, sports arenas and tourist attractions remain shut down, people are looking at destinations that offer an all-under-one-roof experience with fun for the whole family.Kalahari Resorts are a great example of this exclusive experience, with activities for kids and adults, dining options everyone can agree on and plenty of space to play and relax. From water slides and surf simulators to ropes courses and laser tag, you have access to all the fun you can handle without having to leave the resort. Plus, parents enjoy world-class spa services and an adult-only swim-up bar as well.Dreaming and planning for the futureSome people are still not comfortable with vacationing, which is why dreaming of the future and planning trips is the final top trend during the pandemic. With extra time on your hands, it's ideal for researching new destinations, learning about unique opportunities and watching for discounts to help you save on advanced bookings. You might also ask for gift certificates and vacation experiences for holiday gifts so you are ready to roll when you're comfortable with traveling again."

            "body": "In the United States today, more than 30 million people live with diabetes — a challenging condition that requires individuals to constantly, and diligently, manage their body’s needs. Those who use insulin know that carefully logging glucose (blood sugar) readings is necessary for addressing out-of-range levels. And yet, despite the importance of having to track their health information over time, many who live with diabetes also report struggling to keep up the pace with these detailed recording methods.A new survey conducted by the Association of Diabetes Care &amp; Education Specialists (ADCES), and supported by Sanofi, found that although 65 percent of respondents reported they are doing everything they can to manage their diabetes, just as many (67 percent) feel guilty about not doing more.In fact, with the pressures of everyday life, many find recording methods can be difficult to manage. While there are currently a wide variety of different methods available, including tracking glucose levels and insulin use, many believe there is still room for improvement — and are looking to technology to streamline the process of sharing progress with their healthcare team.When considering what could make tracking easier, survey respondents (82 percent) revealed they often wish their data was put together automatically so they can see everything in one place. Further, the vast majority of participating individuals (more than 80 percent) stated that having a device that connects to an insulin injector, automatically tracks/records insulin use and wirelessly sends the information to an app on a smartphone or tablet, would be helpful in more effectively managing their diabetes.“The management of diabetes is complex and so deeply personal that people living with diabetes often need to make drastic changes to their lifestyle, relearning their body’s needs at the most basic level,” says Lorena Drago, MS, RDN, CDN, CDCES and multi-cultural nutrition education expert. “Diabetes care and education specialists and other healthcare professionals have a unique opportunity to personalize and streamline diabetes management — by recommending that people use tools to record their information which are more efficient, more accurate and easier to understand.”It’s worth noting that it’s not just someone’s health at stake; respondents overwhelmingly believe that integrating technology into existing recording methods could also make their lives easier. Specifically, respondents to the survey stated that having a device that could automatically record, store and distribute data would: 1) give them a more personalized understanding of their diabetes (79 percent); 2) make managing or tracking insulin use less time consuming (78 percent); and 3) make them feel more empowered when it comes to managing their diabetes (79 percent).It’s time to bring disease management processes into the digital age. Every day, those who live with diabetes have to take time out of their busy schedules to ensure they’re staying safe and healthy. It’s a frustrating and time-consuming process that many find to be challenging given the unpredictable nature of daily life.

            "author": "BrandPoint",

            "body": "With social distancing, remote work and digital learning the new reality, there's no question that time spent at home has significantly increased. Keeping spaces clean and healthy is a top priority particularly as we head into winter months. Creating a healthy home is easier than you think — consider these five simple steps.Step 1: Change air filters regularlyYour home's heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system typically includes an air filter that pulls dust, contaminants and microscopic allergens out of the air. If you can't remember the last time you changed the air filter, it's time to add it to your list. These filters should be replaced at least once a season to help maintain a healthier home. During seasons that your system is more in use, such as daily heating during cold months, you may want to change it out more often.Step 2: Use products with better ingredientsSome cleaners contain harsh chemical ingredients that can do more harm than good. Look for products that effectively clean with naturally occurring ingredients like hydrogen peroxide. For example, Bona PowerPlus Antibacterial Surface Cleaner kills 99.9% of household germs like influenza A, rhinovirus and E. coli through the power of hydrogen peroxide. This ready to use, streak-free formula cuts grease and grime on sealed non-porous hard surfaces like granite, stone, ceramic tile, stainless steel, glass and more.Step 3: Kick off your shoesWearing shoes inside the home can track in unwanted dirt and germs. Place a shoe mat or basket at often-used entryways to keep organized and to encourage visitors to remove their shoes. Additionally, a door mat both inside and outside of the doorway can keep mud, snow and chemicals like salt melt off floors. As an added touch, snag some comfy house slippers so visitors have no excuse to go shoeless.Step 4: Refresh and remodel with green materialsWith extra time at home, more people are tackling home improvement projects. Whether you are refreshing a space or embarking on a major remodel, look for eco-friendly options such as paint, flooring and other materials with low volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which will ensure healthier air quality. Consider renovating rather than replacing cabinets, floors or furniture. These areas of the home can easily be freshened up with a stain or finish and it prevents these materials from ending up in landfill.Step 5: Add plantsGreenery not only improves the appearance of a house, but the right plants can also help clean the air. The NASA Clean Air Study tested plants' ability to remove indoor air pollutants. Peace lily, lady palm and snake plant (also called mother-in-law's tongue) are a few indoor plants that had a positive impact on indoor air quality. Place these in high use spaces, such as the living room and bedroom, to add to the health and aesthetic of the space.These five steps will help you revamp your home's health quotient so everyone can breathe easier.Bona PowerPlus Antibacterial Surface Cleaner kills 99.9% of Influenza A H1N1 Virus, Rhinovirus, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA], and Trichophyton mentagrophytes on hard, non-porous surfaces in 10 minutes."

            "summary": "",
            "body": "As flu season collides with the COVID-19 pandemic this year, it’s critical to think about how to best protect yourself, your loved ones and the members of your community from getting sick and overburdening an increasingly strained healthcare system. Getting a flu shot each season is an easy and safe way to take preventative action. In a recent Walgreens survey conducted online in August by The Harris Poll, 72% of Americans say they probably or definitely will get the flu shot this season, with 32% of all U.S. adults saying they are more likely to get a flu shot this year than in previous years. While encouraging, the survey also revealed that 28% of Americans have not made plans to get their flu shot this year and many common misconceptions about the flu continue to prevail. Misinformation can discourage some from getting a flu shot and taking the best preventative step they can to ward off seasonal illness. To help make sure Americans are getting the right information, Dr. Kevin Ban, chief medical officer at Walgreens, addresses some of the top questions people have about flu shots. Question 1: I’m already social distancing, wearing a face mask and frequently washing my hands. Do I really still need a flu shot? While these measures are all important steps to help limit the spread of COVID-19, the flu and other respiratory illnesses, getting a flu shot every year can help prevent community spread of the flu and a possible “twindemic” with both flu and COVID-19 circulating at the same time. Last season, the flu shot prevented 3.69 million doctor’s visits and 105,000 hospitalizations, and everyone needs to do their part to preserve healthcare resources as COVID-19 continues to spread. Question 2: What if my insurance doesn’t cover my flu shot? Flu shots are covered by most insurance plans with a $0 co-pay, although provider networks may vary. People enrolled in Medicare Part B and many with Medicaid in certain states may also receive the flu shot at no cost, according to the CDC. Members of the Walgreens Prescription Savings Club may also get a discount of 20% off cash retail price. You can speak with your local pharmacist to learn more about your payment options. Question 3: Is it safe to get a flu shot during the COVID-19 pandemic? Doctor’s offices and pharmacies are taking all the necessary precautions to safely immunize patients. For example, at our pharmacies, we conduct temperature checks and symptom screenings prior to administering a flu shot, require pharmacy team members to wear face masks and plastic face shields, promote social distancing and clean and disinfect the immunization area after the patient has left. Patients can also complete paperwork in advance and schedule appointments online to reduce time in the pharmacy. Staying up to date on routine immunizations like influenza, shingles and pneumonia is more important during the COVID-19 pandemic to help protect communities from vaccine-preventable illnesses.Question 4: How do I know what flu shot is right for me? Your local pharmacist can work with you to determine which flu vaccine is right for you based on your age and health history. In addition to the standard-dose flu shot, there are also flu vaccines designed specifically for people 65 years and older. While high-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccines can help improve antibody response for older people, according to the CDC, seniors may receive any currently licensed flu vaccine that is available. Question 5: Is it too late for me to get a flu shot this year? It’s not too late to get your flu shot for protection during this year’s flu season. Primary care providers and pharmacies typically offer flu vaccines past the peak of the flu season well into the spring. If you haven’t already received your flu shot, now is the time, as it takes about two weeks to develop the antibodies to fight the flu after getting your flu shot. For more information on what to expect when getting your flu shot this year or to make an appointment for a flu shot, visit Walgreens.com/flu."

Last season, the flu shot prevented 3.69 million <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden-averted/2019-2020.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">doctor’s visits</a> and 105,000 <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden-averted/2019-2020.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hospitalizations</a>, and everyone needs to do their part to preserve healthcare resources as COVID-19 continues to spread.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Question 2: What if my insurance doesn’t cover my flu shot?</strong> </p><p>Flu shots are covered by most insurance plans with a $0 co-pay, although provider networks may vary. People enrolled in Medicare Part B and many with Medicaid in certain states may also receive the flu shot at no cost, according to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/faq-flu-season-2020-2021.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the CDC</a>. Members of the Walgreens Prescription Savings Club may also get a discount of 20% off cash retail price. You can speak with your local pharmacist to learn more about your payment options. </p><p><strong>Question 3: Is it safe to get a flu shot during the COVID-19 pandemic?</strong><strong> </strong></p><p>Doctor’s offices and pharmacies are taking all the necessary precautions to safely immunize patients. For example, at our pharmacies, we conduct temperature checks and symptom screenings prior to administering a flu shot, require pharmacy team members to wear face masks and plastic face shields, promote social distancing and clean and disinfect the immunization area after the patient has left. Patients can also complete paperwork in advance and schedule appointments online to reduce time in the pharmacy. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSzbSc9pXas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Staying up to date on routine immunizations like influenza</a>, shingles and pneumonia is more important during the COVID-19 pandemic to help protect communities from vaccine-preventable illnesses.</p><p><strong>Question 4: How do I know what flu shot is right for me?</strong> </p><p>Your local pharmacist can work with you to determine <a href=\"https://www.walgreens.com/health/p2/a/900002/the-flu-basics/2447312\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">which flu vaccine is right for you</a> based on your age and health history. In addition to the standard-dose flu shot, there are also flu vaccines designed specifically for people 65 years and older. While high-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccines can help improve antibody response for older people, according to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/65over.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CDC</a>, seniors may receive any currently licensed flu vaccine that is available. </p><p><strong>Question 5: Is it too late for me to get a flu shot this year?</strong> </p><p>It’s not too late to get your flu shot for protection during this year’s flu season. Primary care providers and pharmacies typically offer flu vaccines past the peak of the flu season well into the spring. If you haven’t already received your flu shot, now is the time, as it takes about two weeks to develop the antibodies to fight the flu after getting your flu shot. </p><p>For more information on what to expect when getting your flu shot this year or to make an appointment for a flu shot, visit <a href=\"https://www.walgreens.com/topic/pharmacy/seasonal-flu.jsp?ban=FluFY21_PR_vanuityURL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Walgreens.com/flu</a>.</p>",

            "body": "This article was sponsored and developed by Neurocrine Biosciences. We are living in an unprecedented time, where everyone’s mental health is being put to the test. Recent research has shown that stress and worry related to the pandemic have had a negative impact on mental health, taking an emotional toll on 53% of adults in the U.S., and for individuals with mental illness, whose conditions often tend to be isolating, the anxiety and increased isolation resulting from these serious times can intensify.To support people during this trying time, Neurocrine Biosciences and Boston-based Me2/Orchestra, the world’s only known classical music organization created for people with mental illness and the people that support them, have launched Monumental Moments™, a new community platform and charitable initiative that aims to foster a spirit of togetherness and provide support for people in the mental health community — along with those in the general public — who have experienced a heightened sense of anxiety and stress during this challenging year of social distancing and unrest.“Music can lift our spirits, bring us together and empower us during the hardest of times,” said Ronald Braunstein, Me2/Orchestra founder. “The creation of this score for Monumental Moments enables us to channel our emotions and connect with the broad community of people who are feeling the impact of this extraordinary year. The score emphasizes moments of discovery, determination, and joy. We hope that it will inspire people to share how they are dealing with the daily stress and challenges of the past year to achieve their own ‘monumental moment’ and help people realize that we are all going through this unusual time together.”Monumental Moments creates an opportunity for people to share their personal moments of success, big or small, in caring for their mental health during this difficult time by posting on social media using the hashtag #MonumentalMoments. The program’s microsite, MonumentalMoments.com, serves as the platform where people can learn more about the initiative, how they can participate, and be connected to a variety of mental health resources.'During this time of isolation and tragedy, it's vital that no one feels alone in their mental health struggle. NAMI is proud to be part of the Monumental Moments initiative aimed at providing support through a community platform for people dealing with mental health concerns of varying degrees,' said Daniel H. Gillison, Jr., Chief Executive Officer of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), the nation's largest grassroots mental health organization. 'The platform aims to amplify the positive success stories of lived experience with the hope that others will find solace and encouragement and stay socially connected while remaining physically distant due to the pandemic. We can work together to help create a community where no one feels alone in their struggle.'As part of Monumental Moments, Me2/Orchestra has created the first-of-its-kind musical score inspired by the real-life experiences of its members. The virtual performance of the original score brings to life the emotional impact this year has had on many and symbolizes the Monumental Moments movement. It features nearly 100 of its members aged 20 to 80 from around the world — 50% of whom are living with a mental health condition — and can be viewed on MonumentalMoments.com.Like most of us, Philadelphia native Jeff S. is learning his new normal of social distancing and isolation while also managing his schizophrenia and tardive dyskinesia (TD). TD is an involuntary movement disorder associated with prolonged use of antipsychotics, commonly prescribed to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression. While he found many ways to manage both conditions before the pandemic, he shares how he is staying grounded during this time. “I’ve always been a fan of listening to folk music. One of my favorite songwriters has a home series on YouTube that I look forward to, the music brings me a lot of comfort and helps to calm me,” said Jeff.The Monumental Moments initiative encourages others to share how they are coping during this time by posting public messages on social media using the hashtag #MonumentalMoments which will help support people living with mental health conditions, including those also living with TD.

            "body": "When Justin found out his dad had been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), he wasn't sure what to expect. Without knowing anything about the condition, he didn't realize that becoming a primary caregiver at age 30 would mean uprooting his lifestyle to support caring for his dad.Like Justin and his dad, many families in the U.S. are affected by COPD, a chronic and progressive lung disease for which there is no cure. Approximately 27 million Americans suffer from the condition, which is the country’s fourth leading cause of death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. COPD is characterized by symptoms like breathlessness, fatigue, persistent cough and wheezing. These may worsen over time and can negatively impact a person’s ability to perform routine daily activities. While people with COPD can work with their physicians and take other proactive steps to control their symptoms, caregivers often play a critical role as part of the support system.A new survey from GSK conducted in collaboration with CHEST and COPD Foundations identified significant gaps in communication between patients and their doctors, which create barriers to optimal COPD management. The survey, which was fielded to 351 people with COPD, 151 caregivers, 249 primary care physicians and 252 pulmonologists, found that caregivers play a valuable role in bridging these gaps and positively impact care by ensuring doctors and their patients are on the same page with regard to the true impact of symptoms.Despite how challenging COPD can be, many patients are hesitant to share important information about their symptoms during medical appointments or are at times not fully aware of the true impact of their COPD. In the survey, 62% of patients said their caregiver notices when they’re struggling to perform routine activities — even without being told.Further, more than six in 10 caregivers reported speaking up during appointments to share the full extent of symptoms their loved one neglected to mention. Justin says that he always tries to accompany his dad during doctor's visits to ensure the conversation is accurate and complete. “When I hear my dad downplay his symptoms during his doctor’s appointments, I encourage him to share as much detail as possible so that the doctor is aware of how he’s feeling. I want him to be honest not only with the doctors but, more importantly, with himself.”The majority of the patients (67%) and physicians (91%) surveyed agreed that appointments are more productive when a caregiver is involved. Many patients even said their caregiver plays a positive role in medication adherence (49%).'Coming to terms with a chronic and progressive disease can be difficult,' said Dr. Riju Ray, GSK Medical Affairs Lead. 'A caregiver may be the right person to help bridge the gap in care to support your personal goals for COPD management.'Today, Justin has grown into his role as a caregiver and is grateful to spend more time with his dad doing what he loves. An avid runner, Justin has channeled his passion for running into a way to raise awareness about COPD. He’s participated in 60 marathons across the country in honor of his dad to raise awareness about COPD, to raise money for advancing COPD research and to empower other families affected by COPD to not lose hope and better cope with the challenges posed by the disease. His advice to those stepping into the role of COPD caregiver for the first time? Be prepared to be more hands-on and don’t be afraid to speak up and ask questions on behalf of your loved one.“Do your homework and show up at doctor’s visits with a list of questions, notes and goals you want to discuss,” he said. “Patients sometimes feel overwhelmed by the amount of information they receive. It helps to have someone there who can ask to learn more about how a medication works, along with possible benefits, risks or side effects.”People living with COPD and their caregivers can visit www.COPD.com for more information and to find resources to help better manage the disease."

            "body": "Imagine your family members were at risk for a life-threatening heart disease but had absolutely no idea.At age 12, Carmen’s doctor noticed a heart murmur, but could not find an explanation. Little did they realize, but this symptom would turn out to be one piece in his family’s larger heart disease puzzle.Beginning in 1982, several of his family members passed away unexpectedly with no identified cause. The first family member was Carmen’s maternal aunt, who passed away at the age of 50. In 1998, over 15 years after the first sudden death, Carmen’s cousin died at the age of 53 while out on a run, and the family finally discovered the cause: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). HCM is a progressive cardiovascular disease that affects the structure and function of the heart and is often hereditary. People with HCM can suffer debilitating symptoms, like being short of breath, passing out, chest pain and a decreased ability to exercise, all of which can interfere with daily life. HCM can also lead to stroke, heart failure or — as had happened to Carmen’s aunt and cousin — sudden cardiac death.After abruptly blacking out while at work one day, Carmen realized that his symptoms could be signs of HCM. He underwent genetic testing and was diagnosed with HCM in 2006. Since then, he’s had to give up his pizza shop and stop flying radio-controlled aircraft due to his worsening symptoms and the risk of passing out.“The doctors told me I could no longer drive, or even ride a bike, for that matter,” Carmen said. “And although everything seems OK from the outside, I don’t always feel like myself on the inside.” In the years since his diagnosis, Carmen has become an advocate within his large extended family, connecting multiple generations to encourage testing and share disease information.Recognizing HCM signs and symptomsHCM is the most common inherited heart disease. It is estimated to affect approximately one in 500 adults in the United States.Signs and symptoms of HCM include:Identifying early symptoms and receiving a diagnosis are crucial in managing HCM and implementing strategies to reduce risks associated with long-term complications. Many patients are prescribed heart failure medications to address certain symptoms. As HCM progresses, patients may need procedures, such as surgically implanted devices or open-heart surgery. For some, heart transplants may be the only viable option. Currently, there is no therapy available to treat the underlying cause of HCM, but there is increasing research in the field.Talking to family about your genetic riskExperts say that it’s not unusual that families aren’t aware they could be at risk for HCM until after a relative passes away. It is estimated that as many as 85% of individuals with HCM remain undiagnosed because many of the most common symptoms, such as shortness of breath and fatigue, overlap with other conditions.It is important to talk to family about your genetic risks. With loved ones planning to gather in-person or connect virtually this holiday season, make time to discuss your family’s shared medical history. Specific questions to ask could include:Share this information with your healthcare provider to explore your risk factors for disease. In Carmen’s case, after his family’s risk for HCM was discovered, his cardiologist was integral in finding ways to manage the disease, as well as identifying extended family members also at risk. Today, Carmen is grateful to have been diagnosed, and grateful that the increased connections with his extended family have helped him raise awareness of HCM risks and the importance of seeking diagnosis and treatment.Knowing your medical history and whether you’re experiencing common signs and symptoms of HCM is an important first step of receiving care.

            "body": "How healthy is your house? After spending more time at home due to quarantine and social distancing, many homeowners are asking themselves this question.This has inspired an increase in home improvements that go beyond aesthetic enhancements. Homeowners want eco-friendly upgrades that improve indoor environmental quality (IEQ), which means improvements that support the health and wellness of the people who live in the home.If you're curious how to improve your home's IEQ, here are three key projects to consider:1. Hydronic radiant heating systemsConventional forced-air systems push heated air through ductwork in the walls and ceilings. There are many drawbacks to this type of system. First, they are inefficient because hot air blows out vents and rises rather than staying lower to keep people comfortable. Second, it circulates dust, allergens and pollutants that lower the indoor air quality. Third, they can be noisy, turning on and off all day.For a healthier home, consider hydronic radiant heating. This technology works by warming water at a heat source and circulating it through piping made of a special polymer called PEX that is installed beneath the floor. For example, Uponor Fast Trak is a simple-to-install, knobbed-mat system that adheres to a concrete slab for quick radiant tubing installation in any area of the home. Learn more at www.uponor-usa.com/radiant.A hydronic radiant system can dramatically improve a home's IEQ. There is no fan to circulate dust, pollen and odors, so you can breathe easier. Because it's in the floor, it keeps the heat low — where you and your family actually live — without hot and cold spots. You can heat in zones to save money, plus, the system is near-silent.2. Natural light and daylightingBeautiful sun shining through a window is a welcome sight on any day. Natural light increases the comfort of a home and can have a positive psychological impact on the people who spend time there. That's why, when choosing home-improvement projects, use daylighting strategies to improve IEQ.Daylighting is a method you can use to welcome more natural light into your home. There are many improvements that support daylighting. Adding windows strategically to brighten spaces throughout the day is a smart first step. Adding skylights to bring in light where traditional windows are not possible or logical, such as in a bathroom, also supports daylighting.Daylighting can be controlled for comfort and privacy with shades, blinds and plants. In spaces where windows and skylights are not possible, adding reflective surfaces to the room design can provide internal lighting by maximizing the sunlight. For example, glossy tile or mirrors throughout a room can help brighten the space and align with daylighting goals.3. Clean air and proper ventilationAirflow is an important part of any healthy home, helping to remove contaminants and bring in fresh air. Proper ventilation prevents mold and mildew growth, removes common pollutants from appliances and other household items, improves indoor air quality and boosts IEQ.To improve your home's ventilation, always open windows and skylights when weather and conditions allow to let in fresh air. Remember to turn on ventilation fans when bathing or showering to remove excess humidity. In addition, use fans in the kitchen to remove smoke and heat while cooking. Finally, maintain filters on items such as air purifiers, humidifiers and your HVAC system.If you have a radiant heat system, continue to use it, as it helps to eliminate the circulation of microscopic particles that can spread germs and trigger allergy symptoms. Considering Americans spend on average 90% of their time indoors, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, prioritizing indoor air quality is essential.IEQ is getting increased attention, as people look to improve their homes and make them healthy for their families, while also boosting their bottom line at resale. These three key areas will help you create a space centered on health and well-being. For more information, visit www.uponor-usa.com."

            "summary": "",
            "body": "In 2020, the phrase “social distancing” became mainstream, as many people around the world had to experience extended periods of quarantining. The mandate to keep distance, limit travel and stay home has left many people to feel anxious, isolated and lonely. Unfortunately, for the 30 million Americans that suffer from overactive bladder (OAB), the feelings are all too familiar.[i]OAB is a condition defined by the sudden urge to urinate that is difficult to ignore or control, with people experiencing that “need to go” feeling more than eight times a day and are frequently woken up two or more times at night.[ii] Beyond physical symptoms, individuals with OAB also report significant impairment to quality of life, with the condition impacting daily events, physical activity, mental health, sexual function, relationships and emotional well-being.[iii] Those affected often suffer in silence as their conditions are misunderstood or not adequately treated.iiiEthnographic research[iv] from Urovant Sciences revealed some unanticipated outcomes of COVID-19 on OAB patients.1. The Relief of Social Distancing For some, COVID-19 has provided a safe haven. Living with OAB can result in unexpected and urgent trips to the bathroom, causing some to skip social events altogether. Some people say they feel more relaxed at home with a bathroom just a few steps away.Vanessa, a saleswoman who has been living with OAB for over 20 years, says being able to work from home has allowed her to go about her daily routine with less stress about her condition. “OAB has always made the smallest of things — like grocery shopping or going to the movies — more challenging. It makes me feel like an outcast when I’m out in public or travelling for work and the only thing on my mind is my bathroom breaks. Spending more time at home during the pandemic has been a relief. I don’t need to plan my routes around my bathroom schedule or risk feeling embarrassed in front of others.”2. The Difference Five Minutes Makes Many stores and restaurants have new COVID-based safety protocols in place to maintain cleanliness. However, something as little as a five-minute delay could shatter an entire day for someone with OAB. Every extra minute waiting in lines, in one-way aisles, or looking for an open bathroom may be the difference between making it home or experiencing a leak.“COVID has made life with OAB even more complicated, and everyday tasks sometimes feel impossible,” said Sia, another woman with OAB. “With all of the restaurants in my area closed, at times I was left with zero options if I have to use the bathroom away from home. I’ve had to plan my errands in advance and even call the stores ahead of time before mapping out my route around the open restrooms. My OAB is constantly in the back of my head.”3. The Doctor will Video Chat You NowFor many, time in quarantine has been spent on projects they otherwise put off: from home organization to baking. This may also be an ideal time to build a stronger relationship with your doctor — especially for women who have been putting off those doctor’s visits. Though more than 40 percent of women in the United States live with OAB symptoms, many individuals delay seeking treatment or even discussing their symptoms with healthcare providers because they think their issues aren’t important enough.iiiTelemedicine, or virtual doctors’ visits, were steadily on the rise before seeing a huge jump in popularity following COVID-19 concerns. Now, telemedicine may also be helping remove roadblocks to care. Patients do not have to wait in-person at doctors’ offices donning a mask, map out where the nearest restroom is, or worry about a long drive to a physician’s office. Some may also be more comfortable having these conversations from the comfort of their home.All of this may result in better outcomes for patients: when a healthcare provider better understands their patients’ lifestyles and needs, the better they can customize their treatment recommendations and symptom management. Talking with a healthcare provider about OAB can improve understanding of the condition, keep patients updated on the latest treatment options, and make it easier to explore the options that may work best for you. Whether virtually or in person (following safety protocols), make your health a priority.To help address the needs of women struggling with OAB, and to help reduce the stigma so often associated with this condition, Urovant created Bladder Chatter: an online, community-based forum that helps empower, inform and support women with overactive bladder. The site is for people who seek to learn from each other in a safe, private and nonjudgmental place. Bladder Chatter hosts expert articles, tips and patient stories that inform OAB patients how they can change the way they think about their OAB.“I’ve tried countless different approaches to manage OAB, and sometimes it feels like this is something I just have to live with,” said Vanessa. “Right now, I don’t even discuss OAB with my family, just one friend who has the same experiences. I would love an opportunity to talk to other women, hear about what’s working for them, and consider new options to discuss with my doctor for my own OAB management.”Join the conversation and start connecting with others at BladderChatter.com.[i] Coyne, K.

            "body": "Feeling a sense of connection and belonging with others is a basic human need. But unfortunately for many older adults, social isolation and loneliness are on the rise, especially because of the necessary social distancing since the COVID-19 pandemic began.The good news is, there are concrete strategies that caregivers and family members alike can take to bring more joy and a sense of play to the lives of the older adults they care about — especially for those who may be coping with cognitive decline, dementia or Alzheimer’s.Many older people could benefit from a focus for their affection, such as a pet, but are no longer capable of caring for one due to the often-strenuous daily responsibilities or costs associated. Whether you live near or far, providing your loved one with the gift of companionship can make all the difference in their lives.Pets with purposeTo help alleviate loneliness and feelings of isolation, Ageless Innovation created the award-winning line of Joy for All Companion Pets — life-like animatronic animals that help aging adults foster essential social connections, improve their emotional health and well-being and bring joy into their lives.Recent research conducted by UnitedHealthcare, AARP Services, and more shows that the introduction of robotic companion pets is helping to improve the quality of life for older adults as it relates to depression, loneliness, social isolation and all forms of dementia. Nearly a dozen studies showed that the Joy for All Companion Pets had meaningful positive impact on recipients.Key findings of these studies reveal:How companion pets make a differenceOne insight from the research was that older adults wanted interactive, two-way companionship, so the need for pets that could give love and receive it influenced the design of these companion pets.Built-in sensors allow them to respond to touch, allowing them to react to their environment. The Companion Pet Cat features VibraPurr technology, mimicking the feeling and sound of a realistic cat purr; and the Companion Pet Pup features built-in BarkBack technology that responds to voices with playful puppy-like sounds.The real impact of Companion Pets Patti LaFleur (@MissPatticake on Instagram) gave a Joy for All Companion Pet Pup to her mother Linda, who suffers from dementia, to help ease her feelings of isolation when she couldn't be there. Her mother named her new companion pup “Popcorn.”“I gave Mom someone to talk with and love on and care for,” explained LaFleur. “My mom was always a nurturer, but in her dementia world she wasn’t able to care for others in the same way.

            "html": "<p>Feeling a sense of connection and belonging with others is a basic human need. But unfortunately for many older adults, social isolation and loneliness are on the rise, especially because of the necessary social distancing since the COVID-19 pandemic began.</p><p>The good news is, there are concrete strategies that caregivers and family members alike can take to bring more joy and a sense of play to the lives of the older adults they care about — especially for those who may be coping with cognitive decline, dementia or Alzheimer’s.</p><p>Many older people could benefit from a focus for their affection, such as a pet, but are no longer capable of caring for one due to the often-strenuous daily responsibilities or costs associated. Whether you live near or far, providing your loved one with the gift of companionship can make all the difference in their lives.</p><p><strong>Pets with purpose</strong></p><p>To help alleviate loneliness and feelings of isolation, Ageless Innovation created the award-winning line of Joy for All Companion Pets — life-like animatronic animals that help aging adults foster essential social connections, improve their emotional health and well-being and bring joy into their lives.</p><p>Recent research conducted by UnitedHealthcare, AARP Services, and more shows that the introduction of robotic companion pets is helping to improve the quality of life for older adults as it relates to depression, loneliness, social isolation and all forms of dementia. Nearly a dozen studies showed that the Joy for All Companion Pets had meaningful positive impact on recipients.</p><p>Key findings of these studies reveal:</p><p><strong>How companion pets make a difference</strong></p><p>One insight from the research was that older adults wanted interactive, two-way companionship, so the need for pets that could give love and receive it influenced the design of these companion pets.</p><p>Built-in sensors allow them to respond to touch, allowing them to react to their environment. The Companion Pet Cat features VibraPurr technology, mimicking the feeling and sound of a realistic cat purr; and the Companion Pet Pup features built-in BarkBack technology that responds to voices with playful puppy-like sounds.</p><p><strong>The real impact of Companion Pets </strong></p><p>Patti LaFleur (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/misspatticake/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@MissPatticake on Instagram</a>) gave a Joy for All Companion Pet Pup to her mother Linda, who suffers from dementia, to help ease her feelings of isolation when she couldn't be there. Her mother named her new companion pup “Popcorn.”</p><p>“I gave Mom someone to talk with and love on and care for,” explained LaFleur. “My mom was always a nurturer, but in her dementia world she wasn’t able to care for others in the same way.

            "body": "In 2002, Xin Z. and Zhigang W. moved to the United States from China to pursue new academic opportunities. Throughout the next decade, they lived in several different states before settling in Michigan.They were happy, but their world turned upside down when Xin was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer.The last thing they expected was to be dealt this devastating diagnosis. But, when life threw them an unexpected obstacle, they refused to retreat.Instead of giving up, Xin and Zhigang fought to find the right tools and determine a treatment plan with their doctors to manage Xin’s prognosis. Seven years later, they are a testament to the power of self-advocacy and the potential of an innovative precision medicine tool that helped guide Xin’s cancer care – comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP).Taking control of Xin’s cancer journeyIn 2013, Xin started to experience pain in her chest and shoulders, along with a persistent cough. Once it was clear the symptoms were there to stay, she saw her primary care doctor, who ordered a chest x-ray. The scans showed a small nodule on her right lung. The doctor incorrectly identified it as an after effect of pneumonia and prescribed her antibiotics.Fast forward to 2015, when the chronic cough and pains in Xin’s chest returned stronger than ever. Her doctor performed a CT scan and found a mass in the upper lobe of Xin’s right lung, exactly where the nodule had presented itself two years earlier.“She was so strong and healthy,” Zhigang said of his wife. “We truly thought we had nothing to worry about. Unfortunately, we ignored the early signs until it was too late.”Further examination revealed that Xin had Stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which eventually metastasized to her hip and brain.“It was more than difficult to cope with Xin’s diagnosis at first,” Zhigang said. “It was something we really had to adjust to, both physically and mentally.”Initial treatments to try controlling Xin’s growing cancer failed, including a debilitating hip replacement surgery to remove the cancerous bone and months of radiation to her leg and brain.“We knew we needed to do something, but we didn’t know where to look or what route to take,” Zhigang said. “At this point, I decided it was time to take matters into my own hands – I needed to drive this vehicle, I needed to be in control.”Zhigang relentlessly searched for alternative treatment approaches for his wife, ultimately leading them to CGP.Comprehensive genomic profiling utilizes next generation sequencing (NGS) to identify gene mutations in a tumor that may drive cancer growth. This can oftentimes help with a personalized approach to therapy when targetable mutations are in the patient’s tumor.Xin’s genomic sequencing test revealed a RET fusion, but Xin’s oncologist said there were no targeted therapies available at the time for this mutation.Undeterred, Zhigang continued his personal research.This proved worthwhile when the couple received information about a clinical trial for an investigational RET-targeted inhibitor. Xin became the first patient with NSCLC to be enrolled in the trial.What Xin learned along the wayXin remains in the clinical trial today, and her lung cancer has shown no further progression.She encourages all partners, family members and caregivers to support their loved ones battling cancer, as Zhigang continues to do for her.“It was so important for me to take some of the burden off of her,” Zhigang said.Xin knows working together as a team is critical in handling a cancer diagnosis. “I’m so thankful and appreciative of my husband’s support,” Xin emphasized.Xin and Zhigang often think about how many people may be misdiagnosed like Xin was. Zhigang emphasized that many of these cancer patients and health care providers may not know about genomic testing.“Five years ago, many oncologists did not see the opportunity of genomic testing,” Zhigang said. “Even today, some oncologists we have encountered still do not have a deep understanding of NGS.”While he knows no test or treatment is a magic bullet, and they don’t always work the same for every patient, Zhigang is thankful for the path that Xin’s testing put them on. Through his and Xin’s experience, he hopes other patients and caregivers are inspired to advocate for themselves through research, asking questions and most importantly, never giving up."

            "body": "The COVID-19 global pandemic has impacted many people around the globe in some way, and as a result, all eyes are on the biopharmaceutical companies that are working to develop safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. As the Chief Patient Officer at Pfizer, Dr. Dara Richardson-Heron describes herself as “a physician by trade and an advocate by choice.” Her current role is focused on helping to ensure that patients’ voices are heard and their concerns are looked to as a guiding light. Since the start of the pandemic, Richardson-Heron has been speaking with patients and answering their questions, and she wants to share four key things about the commitment and dedication her company has to changing the course of this pandemic.1. Working at the speed of scienceWhile the COVID-19 vaccine development process is moving with unprecedented speed to find a solution to this pandemic, we are moving at the speed of science. We are committed to always making the safety and well-being of vaccinated individuals our top priority. We continue to adhere to high scientific and ethical standards regarding the conduct of clinical trials and the rigor of manufacturing processes.2. Focus on diversity in clinical trialsThe pandemic has drawn focus on the need for greater racial and ethnic diversity in clinical trials. This is not a new issue — diverse communities have long been underrepresented in clinical research — but I’m encouraged by the progress being made.We have made intentional efforts to design our studies in a way that is inclusive, which will allow us to generate data from a broad and diverse group of patients. Why? Because we want to evaluate COVID-19 treatments and vaccines in diverse communities, so that these communities have confidence in these potential medical breakthroughs. Our goal is to help address the pronounced health disparities we are seeing with COVID-19. As an industry, we will continue to hold ourselves accountable in this area.3. Proactive healthcare, especially for the aging populationThe pandemic has served as yet another stark reminder of the tremendous value of preventive healthcare. It’s especially critical to help protect vulnerable individuals, including those over 65, who have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19.1 So please remember to schedule routine preventive health exams and screenings for you and your family, and stay up-to-date on recommended vaccinations for diseases that have approved vaccines.4. Stronger together We have made a very intentional effort to mobilize impactful partnerships and collaborations that will continue to endure in the face of this crisis. Our work together has once again demonstrated that we are stronger together. For example, we joined eight other biopharmaceutical companies that are also working toward potential global regulatory filings and approvals of COVID-19 vaccines and signed a historic pledge. The pledge outlines our commitment to always make the safety and well-being of vaccinated individuals our top priority.Sponsored by Pfizer.PP-CVV-USA-0041 © 2020 Pfizer Inc. All rights reserved.

            "body": "Welcoming a four-legged friend into your family is an exciting time for everyone, but puppies, kittens, dogs and cats can easily find themselves in serious trouble while exploring their new surroundings. It is important to remember that pets are naturally curious and explore their worlds with their mouths, so they will want to interact with or consume anything left out at their level. Because of this, your home is filled with potential risks, some obvious and others you might not expect. The good news is there are simple steps you can take to help keep your new pet safe.Purina behavior scientist Dr. Ragen T.S. McGowan offers these timely tips to help pet-proof your home and give you peace of mind that it is a safe place for your dog or cat to live and thrive.How to Keep Your New Pet Safe1. Put away the toxinsMany common household items are toxic for pets. Cleaning supplies, detergent, bleach, fertilizer, pest or rodent bait traps and paint can all cause serious harm if ingested. McGowan says, “Make sure to always store toxic items in a place where your pet cannot access them, either in a locked cabinet or on high shelves out of their reach. Even if you are vigilant about keeping these items out of reach, sometimes accidents happen. It is good to have the number for the Animal Poison Control Center handy or even saved in your phone, just in case: (888) 426-4435.”2. Secure small hardwarePets are attracted to small items that they can mouth, chew or bat around in play. In the home, small hardware items — from buttons, pins, batteries and magnets, to nails, staples, tacks and paper clips — may look appealing to pets, but could cause serious cuts or even damage internal organs if swallowed. “Before your new friend comes home, do a sweep to ensure small hardware items, batteries and magnets are securely stored or kept out of reach,” shares McGowan. “This means getting down to their level and retrieving any items that may have fallen under or behind the furniture. Tacks, pins and magnets should also be moved up from low hanging bulletin boards or the front of the refrigerator, where they could attract the attention of cats, especially.”3. Beware of food bags … and practice proper food storage Almost every one of us is guilty of leaving a bag of chips or box of cereal open on the couch or kitchen table. This may seem harmless, but many food bags, including for pet food, are made from a strong material that helps keep food fresh. A curious pet can get stuck if it goes looking in the bag for leftover crumbs or an early dinner.“Food packaging can be quite attractive to pets. Not only does it smell like food, but it makes a crinkling noise that pets associate with food, treats or play,” shares McGowan. “Make sure to store food or treat bags up high out of your pet’s reach, or inside cabinets or closets. We also recommend rolling the pet food bag closed and storing the entire item in a resealable hard container, so you can keep the label information handy,” advises McGowan. “A pet of any age, size or strength can quickly find themselves in a troubling, and potentially heartbreaking, situation when left unattended with a food bag. By using resealable containers, you limit the risk — and, as a bonus, your food will remain fresh.” Similarly, remember to cut empty bags along the entire top, bottom and down at least one side before disposal, in case your curious pet rummages through the trash.4. Conceal electronics Electronics are ubiquitous in most homes, but the many wires and cords they come with can look like a fun toy to your pet. To keep your pet from chewing them or getting tangled, bundle loose cords behind furniture and store extra chargers and cables in a place that cannot be reached or opened with a paw or nose. For cords that must remain visible, McGowan suggests camouflaging them with cable-coverings or tape, so they are less attractive to your pet. “It is also a good practice to store remote controls and video game controllers in a bin or a drawer where your pet does not have access to them,” she adds. “These items often smell like food or lotions from our fingers which can attract pets to chew on them, but their electrical components and batteries are harmful if consumed.”5. Keep dangerous ingredients out of reach In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, many people are making more meals at home, including experimenting with new recipes. It’s important to remember that some common ingredients can be harmful to your pets. “Before you make your grocery list, review recipes against a list of ingredients that could be toxic for dogs and cats,” counsels McGowan. “Chocolate is well known, but you’ll also want to avoid grapes, raisins and certain spices. Xylitol, a sugar alternative found in everything from cake mixes to yogurt, peanut butter and chewing gum, is another toxic ingredient.” Best practice is to keep all food and ingredients stored in cupboards, pantries, drawers or on high shelves out of reach of your pet.We all want to make the most of life with our new furry companions, and by following the above tips, we can do so safely. We also encourage you to have your veterinarian’s contact information easily accessible, so you are ready in case of trouble.As you prepare to start life with your new pet on the right paw, you can read more tips from McGowan and other Purina experts at www.purina.com/articles."

Not only does it smell like food, but it makes a crinkling noise that pets associate with food, treats or play,” shares McGowan. “Make sure to store food or treat bags up high out of your pet’s reach, or inside cabinets or closets. We also recommend rolling the pet food bag closed and storing the entire item in a resealable hard container, so you can keep the label information handy,” advises McGowan. “A pet of any age, size or strength can quickly find themselves in a troubling, and potentially heartbreaking, situation when left unattended with a food bag. By using resealable containers, you limit the risk — and, as a bonus, your food will remain fresh.” Similarly, remember to cut empty bags along the entire top, bottom and down at least one side before disposal, in case your curious pet rummages through the trash.</p><p><strong>4. Conceal electronics </strong></p><p>Electronics are ubiquitous in most homes, but the many wires and cords they come with can look like a fun toy to your pet. To keep your pet from chewing them or getting tangled, bundle loose cords behind furniture and store extra chargers and cables in a place that cannot be reached or opened with a paw or nose. For cords that must remain visible, McGowan suggests camouflaging them with cable-coverings or tape, so they are less attractive to your pet. “It is also a good practice to store remote controls and video game controllers in a bin or a drawer where your pet does not have access to them,” she adds. “These items often smell like food or lotions from our fingers which can attract pets to chew on them, but their electrical components and batteries are harmful if consumed.”</p><p><strong>5. Keep dangerous ingredients out of reach </strong></p><p>In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, many people are making more meals at home, including experimenting with new recipes. It’s important to remember that some common ingredients can be harmful to your pets. “Before you make your grocery list, review recipes against a list of ingredients that could be toxic for dogs and cats,” counsels McGowan. “Chocolate is well known, but you’ll also want to avoid grapes, raisins and certain spices. <a href=\"https://www.purina.com/articles/dog/nutrition/is-xylitol-bad-for-dogs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Xylitol</a>, a sugar alternative found in everything from cake mixes to yogurt, peanut butter and chewing gum, is another toxic ingredient.” Best practice is to keep all food and ingredients stored in cupboards, pantries, drawers or on high shelves out of reach of your pet.</p><p>We all want to make the most of life with our new furry companions, and by following the above tips, we can do so safely. We also encourage you to have your veterinarian’s contact information easily accessible, so you are ready in case of trouble.</p><p>As you prepare to start life with your new pet on the right paw, you can read more tips from McGowan and other Purina experts at www.purina.com/articles<a href=\"https://www.purina.com/articles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"></a>.</p>",

As a holiday host and master chef in your home kitchen there are still plenty of ways to usher in new traditions and show-off your culinary skills by adding some new twists to the classic holiday menu.Whether cooking for family or a small group of friends, consider these tips to help create memorable meals that will add to everyone's holiday cheer:Serving up tasty, yet simple, appetizersAppetizers are the perfect start to whet appetites while a delicious holiday meal is cooking in the oven. Keep appetizers simple — think finger-foods and one-bite indulgences — and have enough variety to keep everyone pleased. A charcuterie board can be easily assembled with cheeses, nuts, meats or fruits and you can add a compound butter in a ramekin or two by combining a dairy free, plant butter with herbs or spices mixed in, offering something for everyone to enjoy. Then offer a few hot and cold appetizers, like stuffed mushroom bites or mini avocado bruschetta toasties.Add more plant-based food options to the menuWhether it’s because of a dietary or lifestyle choice, allergies or just personal preference, more and more people are choosing to eat plant-based foods so make sure you include some options on your holiday menu. If you want to put a plant-based spin on that familiar buttery recipe that’s been handed down through generations, while still meeting the expectations of your family’s taste buds, use new Flora™ Plant Butter in the dish. With a rich and creamy flavor, this vegan, dairy-free, gluten-free and non-GMO plant butter is made with plant-based oils, uses no artificial flavors or preservatives, and can be swapped with butter 1:1 in baking and cooking. It’s also wrapped in paper packaging rather than plastic, making it a food choice that’s also more environmentally responsible for the planet.'Tis the season to put a twist on the classicsSometimes holiday traditions are meant to be bent, and you can start with your menu. Try spicing up traditional recipes with seasonal-inspired ingredients or herbs, but with a twist. For instance, a side of baked sweet potatoes can be delicious but switching up this classic with sweet potato gratin with cayenne seasoning elevates your menu and adds a dish with the perfect mix of heat and sweet. Don’t be afraid to experiment with new flavor pairings, moving out of your comfort zone to put your own unique spin on holiday dishes.Inspired to take your holiday recipes to the next level? Try this plant-based dessert recipe for a twist on traditional apple pie. It’s the perfect ending to any holiday meal!Apple Pie in a JarServings: 6Ingredients:For the apple filling:4 cups Granny Smith apples, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, 1 lemon, juiced, 1 pinch salt, 1 tablespoon all-purpose flourFor pecan streusel:1 cup pecan halves, coarsely chopped, 2/3 cup lightly packed light brown sugar, 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup rolled oats, 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1/2 cup Flora™ Plant Butter Salted, meltedOptional toppings:Vegan caramel sauce, vegan vanilla ice creamInstructions:Apple filling:1.

            "body": "A sore back. That stiff joint. Another headache. With so much time being spent at home, you're probably noticing more of your daily aches and pains. Many people tend to envision pain only impacting older people, and while everyone's pain is unique, you might be surprised to learn that pain impacts younger generations just as much as older people.Snapshot of pain across AmericaThe vast majority (95%) of U.S. adults ages 25 to 65 report feeling “everyday” aches and pains, according to a survey conducted by Advil Dual Action, in partnership with Wakefield Research. Nearly three-quarters (72%) experience these pains once a week or more.What’s interesting is that younger people report experiencing just as much pain as older generations. In fact, Advil found that one-third (34%) of young adults report experiencing pain every day, nearly equal to that of Gen Xers (36%) and Boomers (35%).Acute pain and younger generationsWith younger people trying to find new ways to keep active while staying at home more often, awareness of acute pain may be heightened. This unprecedented year has left many exercising in less-than-ideal conditions, and makeshift home gym setups could lead to bothersome aches and pains, leaving many desperate for relief.What is acute pain exactly? Acute pain can happen anywhere in the body and feel like a number of sensations, including aching, nagging, burning, stabbing and nauseating. The impact of acute pain goes beyond the physical. Advil’s research shows that younger people are giving up the things they love due to pain, such as sports, hobbies and even work.If you are experiencing acute pain, consider a proactive approach you can manage at home to help find relief. Here are three simple things to try:1. Explore new innovations in OTC medicineWhen experiencing aches and pains, many Americans turn to two of the most common pain-fighting ingredients: ibuprofen and acetaminophen. Ibuprofen works throughout the body, targeting pain at the source, while acetaminophen blocks pain signals to the brain. While previously, people would have to choose between the two ingredients, Advil now offers a combination that combats pain in a truly unique way. Advil Dual Action is the first and only FDA-approved combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen and the biggest innovation in the U.S. over-the-counter oral pain relief category in 25 years. It offers the benefits of both ingredients at once to provide up to eight hours of multi-symptom pain relief. Plus, it contains lower total daily doses of medication than ibuprofen or acetaminophen taken individually. Advil Dual Action is available over-the-counter (OTC) nationwide.2. Try hot and cold therapyAnother method for relieving aches and pains is hot and cold therapy. Applying heat to painful joints or muscles can help soothe aches and soreness by increasing blood flow. For example, for stiffness or tension, use a heating pad for 15 minutes on the affected area. Alternatively, a cold compress can slow blood flow, helping to reduce swelling and pain. This is often used as a temporary treatment for pain associated with an injury, such as an ankle sprain. For example, cold therapy can be used on a sore joint by applying a cool gel pack for 10-minute increments at a time, helping you feel better while the body heals.3. Prioritize stretching and exerciseMany people who experience pain find that they are less likely to engage in physical exercise, for fear that it will exacerbate their pain. To compound the negative, the global pandemic has made it more difficult to get out and exercise. Routines have changed and reduction in movement can lead to additional acute pain. That's why it's important to find ways to incorporate movement into your daily routine. This can be as simple as doing gentle stretches each day for 10 minutes when you wake up or taking a walk around the neighborhood at lunch. Movement can help increase blood flow, reduce stiffness and strengthen the body, which can support short and long-term relief.While acute pain may be common among younger people, it doesn't have to be a fact of life. These simple steps can help anyone feel better and live life fully."

            "title": "Winter wellness: 3 expert tips to boost overall health",
            "author": "BrandPoint",

            "body": "As we head into the chillier months, the winter season brings simple pleasures such as hot cocoa, holiday music and cozy nights by the fireplace. However, the hustle and bustle of the season can also take a toll on your well-being. Stress and unhealthy eating associated with seasonal celebrations are paired with colder weather that makes many people want to curl up inside with a blanket. Plus, the ongoing challenges of virtual learning, remote working and staying home can also impact overall health.Fortunately, Registered Dietitian and Nutritionist Dawn Jackson Blatner has three simple tips to boost your overall health and immunity this winter:Get active dailyWith so many people working and studying remotely, physical activity is already lower. With the addition of colder weather, people of all ages may not be getting enough exercise. It's important to make time to be active at a moderate level for 20-30 minutes a day. You can stay safe working out at home by following free online workout videos, practicing stretching and yoga independently, playing actively with your kids, or doing another activity that gets you up and moving. Whatever you like, just make sure to carve out time daily to be active to ensure the most benefits.Soak up the sun whenever possibleFresh air and being outside is great for supporting mental health, but it has physical benefits as well. Being outside for 10-15 minutes each day helps your body absorb adequate vitamin D from the sun. So even if the weather is chilly, it's worth putting on a few layers and going outside on your patio or taking a walk around the block. You'll be amazed how refreshed you feel! Remember, if you're going to be outside longer than 15 minutes, you'll want to wear sunscreen because even during cool or cloudy days, sunburn is a possibility.Choose nutrient-dense foodsEnsuring you get plenty of vitamins is important, especially during winter months, to support health and wellness. One simple swap you can make is adding nutritious Eggland’s Best eggs to your diet. Compared to ordinary eggs, Eggland’s Best eggs are richer in a variety of micronutrients including six times more vitamin D, 10 times more vitamin E, and more than double the vitamin B12 and omega-3s. These micronutrients can only be derived through the foods we eat and can help support a strong immune system throughout the winter. To add even more nutrition, pair your eggs with plenty of colorful vegetables like spinach, tomatoes, bell peppers and more.If you’re looking for a nutritious and delicious brunch recipe this winter season, try the Asian Frittata from Eggland’s Best:Asian FrittataIngredientsSauce1 tablespoon white vinegar1 tablespoon soy sauce1 teaspoon hoisin sauce1/2 teaspoon freshly grated ginger root1/4 teaspoon finely chopped fresh garlicFrittata6 ounces boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1/4-inch strips1 teaspoon soy sauce2 teaspoons sesame oil6 Eggland's Best Eggs (large)1/2 teaspoon pepper1/4 teaspoon salt3 tablespoons Land O Lakes® Butter1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper4 (1/2 cup) green onions, thinly sliced1 small stalk (1 cup) bok choy, cut into 1/2-inch piecesDirectionsHeat oven to 350 F.

            "body": "It’s natural to want to eat healthy and fuel your body with the nutrients it needs to feel good. Figuring out how to actually eat healthy and make smart choices can be difficult if you don’t know where to begin! Start the new year off strong with these five simple tips to introduce better habits into your diet.1. Plan aheadPlanning ahead is important for healthy eating, and even more so when you’re busy and time is limited. Start by choosing a consistent day to plan all your meals for the week, then check inventory in the fridge, freezer and pantry before making a grocery list. Always keep some healthy and easy shelf-stable or freezer meals on hand for busy days, and if you’re making a meal or snack that is freezable, go ahead and double the recipe so you have it on standby.2. Build a balanced plateEasily build a healthy and balanced plate, without pulling out measuring cups or a scale, with these easy to eyeball proportions: fill half your plate with vegetables, a quarter with healthy carbs, a quarter with lean protein, and a small dollop of healthy fats. Make sure your diet is diverse and eat from all five food groups, enjoying a wide range of vegetables, fruits, lean meats, fish, eggs, nuts, seeds, whole grains and naturally lower-fat dairy foods across each week.3. Fill up on fruits and vegetablesIt's recommended that adults eat at least five portions of fruits and vegetables every day. Fruits and vegetables are healthy snack alternatives to foods like pretzels, sweets and chips. To ensure you always have healthy food options ready for snacking, chop and prep your fruits and veggies using NatureSeal Fresh-Cut Solutions Produce Extender as soon as you get home from the store. It’s the easiest way to keep fresh cut produce like apples, carrots, celery, pears and peaches from browning while maintaining the texture and without altering the flavor. It keeps produce fresh in your fridge for up to one week helping you ensure healthy snacks are always readily available. There is even a similar product for avocados that keeps your guacamole from turning brown! Both products are available on Amazon.4. Cut down salt and sugarRegularly eating foods high in sodium and sugar may have an effect on long-term health. However, consuming both of these in moderation is ok! Most dietary sodium and added sugars come from eating packaged and prepared foods, so learning how to read food labels will help you stay on track. Visit the FDA.gov website for more details on how to properly use the Percent (%) Daily Value on the Nutrition Facts label as a tool to determine if a serving of the food is high or low in sodium or added sugars.5. When eating out, make healthy choices Despite your best efforts to plan, sometimes you end up getting take-out or eating out at a restaurant. This doesn’t mean you have to abandon your healthy eating habits! A few easy and healthier choices include asking for dressing on the side; choosing baked, broiled or grilled options instead of fried; and asking for water instead of sodas and other sweetened beverages. Finally, if you’re not too hungry or the serving size is large, simply divide your plate into two servings and save half for another meal.Making dramatic changes to your diet all at once can be hard to swallow, literally. Keep these tips in mind and try incorporating them over time into your daily routine for a healthier lifestyle."

            "title": "5 tips on dating successfully during a pandemic",
            "author": "BrandPoint",

            "body": "Whatever your dating life was like before the pandemic, it’s most likely changed due to the circumstances at hand. Thankfully, many online dating platforms are rising to the occasion, providing secure and safe ways for people to connect. In turn, singles everywhere are getting creative, figuring out how to learn more about each other before meeting in person.For example, Bumble, the women-first social networking app, offers the millions of people on its platform the opportunity to video chat or voice call potential dates. Even as pandemic lockdowns first began nationwide, Bumble saw video calls on their platform increase nearly 70% just from mid-March to early May.Here are some tips for mastering the art of virtual dating and navigating in-person dating first steps.1. Switch up your means of communicationDoing one video call after another is exhausting. Break up how you regularly interact with potential dates. Suggest a voice call one day, video chat another day, or stick to texting during the week. You can also spare your thumbs the trouble and leave an audio message, which is available on various messaging services and platforms, including Bumble.2. Don’t treat virtual dates like job interviewsWhile it's common to ask questions about your date’s life, there are ways you can interact without making it seem like a job interview. If there’s ever been a time to get creative with date ideas, it’s now.Hop on a video chat, throw on your chef’s hat, cook the same meal from home, and compare the results for some friendly competition. Feeling lazy? Order takeout from the same restaurant.You can also offer a virtual tour of your place and ask to see theirs — or for less pressure, have them show you their view out the window, or ask them to introduce you to their dog or cat.3. Set time limitsIf you have several hours on your hands, trying to fill the void with conversation can be daunting — and awkward. Instead, set expectations and boundaries by saying, “I only have a half-hour to chat today” (with no excuse required). Once the time is up, you can politely excuse yourself.Not only does this give you an escape hatch if things aren’t going well, but it also gives you a break — and a chance to mull things over before you divulge every secret you’ve had since 6th grade if things are going great.4. Have “the COVID talk”At some point, especially if you want to meet in person, it’s necessary to discuss your level of comfort with social distancing. To avoid making the other person feel defensive, put it in terms of your lifestyle. Explain what health precautions you take, such as mask-wearing and avoiding crowds.Everyone is going to have a different comfort zone. You don't need to apologize – you just need to be a good communicator! Make sure you're on the same page as your date before deciding to meet in-real-life.5. Plan a socially distant first date (or two, or more)If you’ve ever seen a Jane Austen adaptation, you know that dating in the 19th century was all about taking walks. It seems like a good time to revive that fad!Too cold for a walk? Maybe you can go ice skating or skiing. If you’d prefer to connect over a conversation during a more low-key date, bundle up or meet at a semi-sheltered location like an outdoor market. Just keep your distance from crowds — and keep that mask on!At the end of the day, don’t take dating too seriously! Dating is a form of exploration — it’s supposed to be something that adds to your life. Take a break if you need it. And when you get back to swiping, you’ll be able to bring a more confident self to the table.For more data-driven tips, expert advice and resources to help guide your dating journey in 2021, check out Bumble’s Dating 101 in 2021, at Bumble.com/DatingGuide."

Thankfully, many online dating platforms are rising to the occasion, providing secure and safe ways for people to connect. In turn, singles everywhere are getting creative, figuring out how to learn more about each other before meeting in person.</p><p>For example, <a href=\"https://bumble.onelink.me/3396940749?pid=press&amp;c=press-release\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bumble</a>, the women-first social networking app, offers the millions of people on its platform the opportunity to <a href=\"https://bumble.com/en-us/the-buzz/video-chat-voice-call\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">video chat or voice call</a> potential dates. Even as pandemic lockdowns first began nationwide, Bumble saw video calls on their platform increase nearly 70% just from mid-March to early May.</p><p>Here are some tips for mastering the art of virtual dating and navigating in-person dating first steps.</p><p><strong>1. Switch up your means of communication</strong></p><p>Doing one video call after another is exhausting. Break up how you regularly interact with potential dates. Suggest a voice call one day, video chat another day, or stick to texting during the week. You can also spare your thumbs the trouble and leave an audio message, which is available on various messaging services and platforms, including Bumble.</p><p><strong>2. Don’t treat virtual dates like job interviews</strong></p><p>While it's common to ask questions about your date’s life, there are ways you can interact without making it seem like a job interview. If there’s ever been a time to get creative with date ideas, it’s now.</p><p>Hop on a video chat, throw on your chef’s hat, cook the same meal from home, and compare the results for some friendly competition. Feeling lazy? Order takeout from the same restaurant.</p><p>You can also offer a virtual tour of your place and ask to see theirs — or for less pressure, have them show you their view out the window, or ask them to introduce you to their dog or cat.</p><p><strong>3. Set time limits</strong></p><p>If you have several hours on your hands, trying to fill the void with conversation can be daunting — and awkward. Instead, set expectations and boundaries by saying, “I only have a half-hour to chat today” (with no excuse required). Once the time is up, you can politely excuse yourself.</p><p>Not only does this give you an escape hatch if things aren’t going well, but it also gives you a break — and a chance to mull things over before you divulge every secret you’ve had since 6th grade if things are going great.</p><p><strong>4. Have “the COVID talk”</strong></p><p>At some point, especially if you want to meet in person, it’s necessary to discuss your level of comfort with social distancing. To avoid making the other person feel defensive, put it in terms of your lifestyle. Explain what health precautions you take, such as mask-wearing and avoiding crowds.</p><p>Everyone is going to have a different comfort zone. You don't need to apologize – you just need to be a good communicator! Make sure you're on the same page as your date before deciding to meet in-real-life.</p><p><strong>5. Plan a socially distant first date (or two, or more)</strong></p><p>If you’ve ever seen a Jane Austen adaptation, you know that dating in the 19th century was all about taking walks. It seems like a good time to revive that fad!</p><p>Too cold for a walk? Maybe you can go ice skating or skiing. If you’d prefer to connect over a conversation during a more low-key date, bundle up or meet at a semi-sheltered location like an outdoor market. Just keep your distance from crowds — and keep that mask on!</p><p>At the end of the day, don’t take dating too seriously! Dating is a form of exploration — it’s supposed to be something that adds to your life. Take a break if you need it. And when you get back to swiping, you’ll be able to bring a more confident self to the table.</p><p>For more data-driven tips, expert advice and resources to help guide your dating journey in 2021, check out Bumble’s Dating 101 in 2021, at <a href=\"http://bumble.com/DatingGuide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bumble.com/DatingGuide</a>.</p><p></p>",

However, only one in 10 Americans meets the recommendations for fruit and vegetable intake according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Confusion around the Glycemic Index (GI) and its dietary implications may be another barrier to adequate consumption.'The GI has been around for 40 years,' explains registered dietitian Constance Brown-Riggs, MSEd, RD, CDE, CDN. 'Its intention is to indicate with a single number how quickly a food will cause a rise in glucose in the bloodstream, and it can be used by people who want to achieve weight loss or by people with diabetes for choosing which carbohydrate-containing foods to eat. However, the GI doesn't give the full picture, and many nutrition professionals, like me, believe that it leads to misinformation about the healthfulness or nutritional qualities of foods, including fruits and vegetables.'Brown-Riggs offers her insight into the most common GI misconceptions, supported by findings from a new survey conducted by Today’s Dietitian and sponsored by Potatoes USA:Myth: High-GI foods should be avoidedTruth: Foods like potatoes, carrots, watermelon and ripe bananas have GI scores that are categorized as “high,” and this score might lead people to remove them from their diets or label them as “bad” for their health. The truth is that these are nutrient-dense fruits and vegetables that should be included as part of any healthy, balanced eating plan.Even nutrition professionals surveyed who use the GI with their patients or clients do not rule out high-GI foods completely. Three out of five strongly believe that eliminating high-GI foods and allowing only low-GI foods can cause people to exclude perfectly healthy foods from their diet, like potatoes. Potatoes should be encouraged in any diet because they are a nutrient-dense vegetable and high-quality complex carbohydrate that provides 3 grams of plant-based protein per serving, 30% of the recommended daily value of vitamin C and underconsumed nutrients including potassium (15% of the daily value) and fiber (7% of the daily value) per 5.3-oz. serving with skin.Myth: Using the GI is the only way to select foods and plan mealsTruth: The reality is, it’s more important to focus on the overall nutritional qualities of a food when building meals. It’s also more practical to focus on the glycemic effect that a meal has on blood sugar rather than focus on the effects from individual foods. That means looking at carbohydrate needs and content at meals; realizing how the fiber, protein or fat content of a meal can impact blood sugar; and prioritizing combinations that work to meet individual goals.'When choosing foods, it's important to consider the big picture and know that being balanced is the best approach rather than focusing on one number,' says Brown-Riggs. 'A versatile nutrient-dense vegetable like the potato can be prepared in so many enjoyable ways, like mashing, roasting, sautéing, steaming, grilling, baking and more. They’re easy to prepare and pair with a variety of cuisines, too. Potatoes are a good carb and perfect addition to a healthful, balanced plate.'For reference, a medium skin-on white potato (148 g/5.3 oz.) has:Myth: Nutrition professionals use the GI frequently with patients and clientsTruth: The GI is not a tool that the overwhelming majority of nutrition professionals use when providing dietary guidance or recommendations. Nearly three-quarters (73%) of nutrition professionals surveyed report that they do not use the GI when counseling their patients and clients; and among those who do use it, 70% do so infrequently. An overwhelming majority (83%) of nutrition professionals also report that the GI isn’t part of the nutritional guidelines for food or meal selection of clients or patients in their practice.Rethink the GI and be inspired to try new recipes, such as this flavor-packed Mediterranean Spiralized Potato Salad, which uses chilled potato and zucchini noodles and can be eaten at home or made in containers for easy on-the-go meals.For full survey results, visit the Today’s Dietitian White Paper landing page at www.todaysdietitian.com/white_papers.shtml.

            "body": "You’ve probably gone through this before — in the midst of holiday festivities, you abandon the healthy habits you’ve been working on all year long. You tell yourself, “I’ll start eating healthy again on Jan. 1.” Meanwhile, you give in to temptation, shifting the burden to your next New Year’s resolutions.The truth is, nutrition is important all year — even during the holidays. So even if you let yourself splurge a little, that doesn’t mean you have to throw all your best habits away until the new year begins.“The hectic nature of the holiday season may be a tough time for many to maintain their healthy lifestyle, but it’s important not to write off your healthy lifestyle goals,” said Dr. Kent Bradley, chief health and nutrition officer at Herbalife Nutrition.In an annual survey by Herbalife Nutrition, over half (56%) of the respondents revealed that they plan on using the holidays as an excuse to postpone healthy choices — assuming they would start fresh in January. That number was up 15% from last year, showing that the added stress of 2020 may be having an impact. In fact, 49% of the global respondents said they believed they deserved more holiday treats this year because of the pandemic.How bad can holiday overeating get? Here’s what American respondents admitted they’ve done during the holidays:If you don’t want to join those statistics, follow Dr. Bradley’s tips for sticking to your healthier habits throughout the holidays — and beyond.1. Remember why you established health goalsAre you trying to achieve your ideal weight, be more active or just want to take better care of yourself? Perhaps you have a specific health risk that you are working to reduce. Write the top reasons you want to stay healthy and post them where you can see them every day.2. Snack on high-quality, nutritious foods“One way to beat temptation is to eat healthy snacks that are high in protein, curbing the desire to eat,” said Dr. Bradley. Keep foods like raw nuts and seeds, hard-boiled eggs, lean meat and low-fat cheeses available for snacking. Snacking on your high-protein foods a little before a big meal can prevent you from over-indulging.3. Choose colorful, balanced mealsWhen choosing foods at the family meal, select colorful veggies and fruits to supplement your protein, and strive for a balance of protein, veggies and grains or pasta on your plate.4. Watch portion sizesIt’s so easy to overeat when all the food looks delicious! If you want to taste several dishes, limit yourself to a spoonful of each item so you don’t end up overstuffing. If you can, use a smaller plate so you’re not tempted to pile on. Sip water between bites to slow down and give yourself time to feel full.5. Limit 'splurge' daysIf you want to treat yourself, remember to limit the treat to one occasion. For one special event, allow yourself a treat — but get back to your healthy habits the next morning.According to the survey, of those Americans postponing healthy habits, 4 in 10 already started letting themselves fall off the healthy wagon in mid-November, and 62% of them said they’re adopting a “New Year, new me” attitude — counting on New Year's resolutions to get them back on track.Resolutions are a great way to kick off the year on a positive note, but make sure you set achievable goals. “Small and steady changes to your diet and fitness routine are more sustainable,' said Dr. Bradley, 'and having a community to encourage and celebrate your success with you, even if virtually, can make a huge difference.”Top resolutions were found to be exercising more (26%), making healthier food decisions (25%) and focusing on self-care (21%).Want more nutrition advice?

            "body": "Home may be where the heart is, but the higher energy bills from staying home 24/7 are causing households across the country a hefty case of heartburn. The hot summer months were tough enough, but as we head into the cold winter months, we’re in for another peak in power bills. Although you may not feel in control of lowering those bills, there are a number of ways households can reduce monthly energy usage and costs.Here are tips for changes — large and small — that can add up to big savings on utility bills.1. Reduce your hot-water usageHot water heaters can contribute to as much as 13% of your electric bill. You can lower the costs of heating up water in your home by taking shorter showers and lowering the standing temperature on your water heater. Lowering that temperature can also help prevent scalding due to overly hot water, which is a good safety measure for households with young children. According to Energy.gov, some manufacturers usually set their water heater thermostats at 140 degrees Fahrenheit, but you can easily set the temperature down to 120 degrees for an energy savings of 4-22% annually.2 Go solar and put your home to work for youNow is a great time to go solar, no matter where you live, and according to a 2020 survey by Harris Insights &amp; Analytics, homeowners are increasingly interested in solar energy as a way to help take control of their energy bills while investing in their home — their most prized possession.Lower costs. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, the cost to install solar has dropped by more than 70% over the last decade, and it’s even less if you take advantage of state and federal tax credits. Solar panels installed in 2020 receive a 26% federal tax credit, and in 2021 will receive a 22% tax credit. Over the lifetime of a solar system, the average home can save between $10,000 and $30,000 in energy bills.Investment Opportunity. At a time of historically low interest rates, homeowners see solar as an investment, not just a purchase. So it’s important to find a brand you can trust, a company that will stand behind its products for years to come. It helps to look for a solar panel manufacturer that offers a best-in-class 25-year warranty to provide peace of mind for years to come.Easy. New virtual tools and resources also make going solar easier than ever, like LG’s personal solar advisor called “Solar Concierge.” It includes a free analysis of your home and will guide you step-by-step toward the best solar option.3. Upgrade your HVAC system With as much as half of the energy in your home going towards heating and cooling, choosing an ENERGY STAR certified HVAC system can have a big impact on your comfort and your utility bills. Look for efficient systems with stylish indoor units like LG’s sleek Art Cool Mirror that offers enhanced performance in a beautiful mirrored design. Choose a single zone system to provide added comfort to a room or a multi-zone solution for whole home comfort.Another simple upgrade is to use a programmable thermostat. Set it and forget it to enhance savings. As temperatures change in the summer and winter, adjusting the thermostat just a few degrees higher in the summer and lower in the winter can make a big difference. And according to Healthline.com, it’s easier to sleep comfortably in a cooler room (around 65 degrees Fahrenheit), so automatically lowering your thermostat at night during the fall and winter could mean both better sleep and lower utility bills.4. Replace old bulbsYou’ve probably heard this before, and you may have even replaced one or two bulbs in your home already. But the truth is, it’s the easiest step to take that can save a lot of energy.Swapping out your old incandescent light bulbs with LED bulbs saves both energy and money in the long run. According to EnergyStar.gov, an Energy Star certified LED bulb produces light up to 90% more efficiently than incandescent lighting. And while they may cost a little more up front, they last up to 25 times longer than traditional light bulbs.5. Ask your utility company for an energy auditFinding out where you may have leaks or insufficient insulation can help you discover specific ways to reduce energy costs. Most utility companies offer energy audits for free, to help homeowners assess where they could be losing heated or cooled air.Once you’ve identified trouble spots, you can prioritize and tackle home repairs and home improvements from the minor to the major, such as caulking around windows and weather-stripping doors to adding attic insulation or replacing old windows.Following even one or two of these steps right now can help you reduce your monthly energy bills and enjoy your home comfortably this winter and for years to come."

Keep in mind, all changes made to coverage during open enrollment take effect on Jan. 1, 2021.1. Do your homework and research changesChanges to your health status, prescription drugs, budget, or doctors or other health care providers may mean that your current plan is no longer the most cost-effective choice for you. Insurance companies can also make annual changes in your Part D prescription drug plan or Medicare Advantage plan that might affect the drugs covered, provider networks and your out-of-pocket costs. Visit Medicare.gov to understand the benefits and costs of each plan so you can find the coverage that works best for your current needs. Furthermore, consider going over your plan with an expert; the State Health Insurance Assistance Program offers free (government-funded) one-on-one consultations.2. Check that your doctors and providers are in-networkIt’s smart to check that your preferred doctors, hospitals and pharmacies are in the plan’s provider network, especially before selecting a Medicare Advantage plan. If you visit a doctor, hospital or pharmacy that is outside of the network, you will likely have to pay more. If your insurance company has changed your plan’s provider network for next year, you may want to use open enrollment to switch to a plan that will include your current doctors, hospitals and pharmacies in-network to lower your medical costs. Additionally, check telehealth coverage so you can meet your doctors over the phone or on the computer if appropriate. Note: With Original Medicare, you can go to any doctor, health care provider, hospital or facility that accepts Medicare patients.3.

It’s important to ensure that your plan covers the medications you need and that it’s convenient for you to access your drugs through the plan’s network of pharmacies. Switching prescription drug coverage, or even adding it for the first time, can help make the critical medical treatments you need less expensive.4. Assess if your plan is still a good fit for your budgetAnnually, there may be changes to your Medicare plan that affect your out-of-pocket costs. These are your expenses for medical care that aren’t reimbursed by insurance. When selecting a plan, you should consider what you will be responsible for paying under the plan, including the deductible, out-of-pocket limit, co-pays, and coinsurance. Also, if you are enrolled in Original Medicare and do not already have supplemental coverage, now may be a good time to consider purchasing a Medigap plan.5.

There may be assistance available to you if you cannot afford the out-of-pocket costs for your prescription medications.If you have limited income and resources, you may qualify for a federal Medicare Low Income Subsidy (LIS) — also known as Extra Help — to help pay for your prescription drug costs.

Through Amazon.com’s grocery offerings and Amazon Fresh, SNAP recipients can enjoy time-saving benefits with free and convenient home delivery available on qualifying orders.Experts at the Food Research &amp; Action Center (FRAC), which works to eradicate poverty-related hunger and undernutrition in the United States, understand the importance of making SNAP benefits available for online grocery shopping:'The online SNAP purchasing pilot is one important piece of the puzzle for food access for low-income customers. It puts SNAP customers on an equal footing with other consumers and provides new options for them to get food into their hands. SNAP is one of our country’s most vital social safety nets and must continue to play a critical role in reducing hunger, malnutrition and poverty. Online ordering is important in regular times but especially so when we all have been encouraged to practice social distancing and protect individual and public health. The pilot program helps vulnerable households gain greater access to healthy food while staying home.”What is offered: You can now use a SNAP EBT card to order groceries from Amazon and Amazon Fresh with no membership required.

SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, is a federal nutrition program that provides benefits to help supplement food budgets for individuals and families. SNAP benefits have traditionally been used in-store and now they're also accepted online to purchase groceries.</p><p>Retailers like Amazon have made ordering groceries online easier than ever, and now SNAP recipients can shop for food products online, gaining access to low prices and vast selection. Through Amazon.com’s grocery offerings and Amazon Fresh, SNAP recipients can enjoy time-saving benefits with free and convenient home delivery available on qualifying orders.</p><p>Experts at the Food Research &amp; Action Center (FRAC), which works to eradicate poverty-related hunger and undernutrition in the United States, understand the importance of making SNAP benefits available for online grocery shopping:</p><p>\"The online SNAP purchasing pilot is one important piece of the puzzle for food access for low-income customers. It puts SNAP customers on an equal footing with other consumers and provides new options for them to get food into their hands. SNAP is one of our country’s most vital social safety nets and must continue to play a critical role in reducing hunger, malnutrition and poverty. Online ordering is important in regular times but especially so when we all have been encouraged to practice social distancing and protect individual and public health. The pilot program helps vulnerable households gain greater access to healthy food while staying home.”</p><p><strong>What is offered: </strong></p><p>You can now use a SNAP EBT card to order groceries from Amazon and Amazon Fresh with no membership required.

            "body": "The COVID-19 pandemic means as a parent, you may be juggling your new roles of part-time remote teacher, IT technician and cafeteria chef along with your normal work responsibilities. The physical, mental, and for some, financial toll of this arrangement has left many feeling exhausted and stressed.In fact, MetLife’s recent study on mental health found that having kids at home or no access to childcare or in-person schooling is the biggest single source of stress for parents of kids under 12 (52%) after fear of contracting the virus or a friend/family member contracting the virus (66%). Compounded by rising financial anxieties from possible financial setbacks, many parents are looking to benefits provided by their employer during open enrollment — the period of time wherein U.S. employees can make changes to their health insurance coverage and enroll in other insurance benefits — to build financial strength and help prepare for the unexpected.This may be why, according to MetLife’s 2020 open enrollment survey, two-thirds (66%) of parents with kids under age 12 feel that open enrollment is more important this year than last year, and almost 60% plan to spend a greater amount of time selecting their benefits.Setting aside time to prepare for open enrollment may seem overwhelming with all that’s going on now — particularly for parents with kids at home — but since changes to benefits are not available throughout the year outside of major life events, such as getting married, divorced or having a baby, it’s important to make it a priority. Fortunately, you can get started with three simple steps:1. Pick benefits best suited to your family.Even if you’re happy with the coverage you have, don’t assume you can set it and forget it. Employers often introduce new benefit offerings, and plan benefits can shift (like changes to dentists participating in the network or prescription medication coverage).Start by evaluating what you’ve spent for healthcare over the last few years and think about any significant expenses you expect to incur in the coming year, such as the birth of a baby or braces for your teenager.Next, read the information provided by your company to see what’s new for 2021. Some companies are now offering additional access to telemedicine or other mental health benefits. Perhaps your family has adopted a pet during the pandemic? Many employers offer pet insurance, which can help pet parents offset costs for vet visits. By taking the time to properly evaluate the plans your company offers, you can save hundreds — or even more — every year.2. Explore new ways to protect against unexpected, out-of-pocket medical expenses.Many employers offer a wide array of benefits — beyond medical, dental and vision coverage — that can close potential financial gaps and help parents safeguard their incomes from the unexpected. Critical illness or hospital indemnity plans help protect against unforeseen out-of-pocket costs by providing a lump sum payout if you are diagnosed with certain illnesses or hospitalized. Parents may also look at incorporating health savings or flexible spending accounts that allow you to use pre-tax dollars to cover expenses related to childcare and healthcare, as well as commuting costs, which reduce taxable income and earn interest.Finally, legal plans provide access to a wide network of attorneys, for a limited additional charge, if any. These professionals can help prepare critical documents, such as wills and estate plans, which are important for new parents, as well as powers of attorney or advance health care directives, which are important when a child turns 18 and heads off to college.3. Maximize your savings.The pandemic and its many financial aftershocks have exposed a vulnerability we already knew existed: Americans simply don’t save enough. Therefore, while retirement savings can usually be adjusted throughout the year, open enrollment is a good time to reevaluate and make sure that, if your company matches employee contributions to retirement accounts, you are saving at least the minimum percentage to earn the match. If not, you’re leaving money on the table.As enrolling in new benefits plays a direct role in your monthly expenses, it’s an opportune time to begin building your savings. Automate your savings by either having a portion of your paycheck directly deposited into your savings account or by setting up regular transfers from your checking to your savings. Automatically moving money to your savings means it will be there when you need it — which can help quell parents’ financial anxieties steadily throughout the year.Employee benefits, at the most basic level, are provided to help improve your physical and financial well-being. Spending time reviewing benefit options and choices now can, in turn, help to alleviate stress later, giving parents — and all employees — more time to focus on their families. Get started now and help make sure your family is in the best possible position to have a healthy, financially secure new year.To learn more about making open enrollment decisions and how to maximize your benefits, visit: metlife.com/openenrollment."

While savings may have resulted from changes in lifestyle and working from home, online spending has increased dramatically. Millions of people lost their jobs and dipped into their retirement accounts. Under the CARES Act, which went into effect during the pandemic, investors were permitted to withdraw money from their retirement funds in 2020 only without paying the 10% early withdrawal penalty — and they did so in record numbers.A third group of investors and retirees chose to avoid making any investment decisions, believing that the safe move was to not focus on the stock market’s wild ride. This “bunker mentality,” however, may have put them at greater long-term risk by not taking advantage of opportunistic financial management solutions.What is driving these different behaviors — particularly investors unwilling to make financial moves in such times of stress and volatility? According to a recent Forrester study*, underlying investor inertia is a lack of understanding regarding different types of investment accounts: Consumer involvement in wealth management options offered through insurers and other financial institutions depends in large part on their comfort with financial concepts. Many are unfamiliar with how different wealth management options work and which are best for them. Moreover, due to the pandemic, call centers have longer wait times, leaving many without the resources to make smart decisions on their own.Digital engagement and education: Key to meeting financial goalsAccording to Meera Krishnamurthy, Cognizant’s Global Head of Insurance, addressing a lack of financial education is being solved with digital solutions. “Utilizing predictive data analytics, insurers and financial institutions can offer personalized content that is streamed directly to their customers’ dashboards and emails, advising them on opportunities that will help them reach their financial goals,” Krishnamurthy said.Technology companies like Cognizant are helping insurers and financial institutions directly engage their customers during the pandemic. Using Cognizant’s Personalized Interactive Video solution, one global group insurance provider saw a 45% increase in portal registration for new members, and, at the same time, a significant drop in call center activity, indicating that the online self-service tools and information was meeting customers’ expectations.“There’s no benefit to social distancing from financial markets,” Krishnamurthy continued. “Insurers are helping plan participants, members and policyholders take control of their financial future through direct virtual client engagement — including easy-to-understand videos that guide them through the details of their coverage and educate them on how to best use 24x7 online app self-service features.”Smart investing driven by smarter fintechAs the opportunity and demand for personalized, digitized services grow, insurers and financial institutions are rapidly adopting new tools, such as account aggregation, personalized content delivery and accountability triggers. By partnering with technology solutions companies like Cognizant, insurers and financial institutions are delivering personalized wealth management coaching to their clients that is backstopped by powerful data analytics tools, predictive analytics and machine learning.Financial goals for various age groups naturally differ, and those goals may have changed during the pandemic. Millennials tend to be concerned with paying down debt or saving for a down payment on a home, while Gen X and Baby Boomers generally focus on saving for retirement and investing in education planning via 529 accounts. Yet with the help of digital technology, businesses offering wealth management solutions can better understand their individual investors’ needs and create targeted messaging that accounts for what is in the best interest of plan participants.Now, the opportunity to merge the benefit of interpersonal wealth management, the ease of making investment changes online, and the knowledge on how to best benefit from both is arriving. With a modern form of personalized digital engagement, investors are becoming more empowered through their knowledge and ability to act on that information.“As we look toward 2021, we expect the digital acceleration that was brought on by the pandemic to continue,” says Cognizant’s Krishnamurthy. “Insurers and retirement services companies will provide the personalized tools and the ease with which to access those tools to empower plan participants and members to take charge of their financial wellness.”*Forrester study*: https://www.forrester.com/report/Use+Digital+Technologies+To+Boost+Customers+Financial+Capability/-/E-RES160519?objectid=RES160519"

Perhaps your house has become more than you can handle, or you have health concerns that require more care — or maybe you’d just like to live in a warmer climate. Whatever your reasons for considering a change, you’re probably concerned about the cost of such a move.You may be surprised to learn that there can be financial advantages to moving to a retirement community.Here’s what you need to know:Your (or your spouse’s) care needs may changeChoosing a “continuing care retirement community” (CCRC) means that you will have options within a continuum of care, so you’ll be taken care of no matter what your needs are, and how they may change over time. This can make it much easier — and much less costly — to transfer from an independent living situation all the way to receiving any level of care that you may need in the future.For example, within one single community like The Spires at Berry College in Rome, Georgia, your options include Independent Living, Assisted Living, Skilled Nursing &amp; Rehab and Memory Care.It may be more affordable than you expectWhile many CCRCs require a significant entrance fee, most of the time that fee is almost fully refundable at the end of the contract, meaning that you get money back if you decide to move somewhere else or your family inherits money when you pass. It’s important to review the different types of contracts that are available to you within the CCRC model.The sale of your home can help pay the entrance fee for this model, and if you add up all the costs of living in your home now, you may find that a retirement community is actually much more affordable than you thought — especially if you need or may soon need in-home care as well.Your current expenses probably include items like:Once you total up these costs, remember that at a retirement community you won’t have any of these expenses or worries.Tax benefits may applyEveryone’s situation is unique, so you should always consult your personal tax advisor for specific advice before making a move. However, there are potential tax benefits you should be aware of when making your decision.For example, residents of entry-fee retirement communities may be eligible to deduct a portion of the entry fee and possibly monthly fees as well, depending on the type of contract offered by that community.Continuing care retirement communities may offer financial assistanceMany CCRCs can help you find bridge financing to help bridge the time between the sale of your current home and moving in to the community, among other possible financial resources.“Check with the community you’re interested in to find out about financial options they may have that may not be advertised,” advises Jill Trapp, marketing director for The Spires. “For example, we work with potential residents on finding creative solutions to help with their financial needs.”Moving in sooner can save you moneyOver the long term, the sooner you make your move to a CCRC, the less expensive it will be. Many communities offer an easy-to-use online calculation tool that can help you determine if moving there would be a good financial fit for you. To evaluate your situation, try out the Affordability Calculator offered by The Spires at Retireatberry.com/pricing/affordability-calculator.Making any move can be challenging, but continuing care retirement communities are focused on helping you relax and enjoy this time of your life to the fullest.

However, there are potential tax benefits you should be aware of when making your decision.</p><p>For example, residents of entry-fee retirement communities may be eligible to deduct a portion of the entry fee and possibly monthly fees as well, depending on the type of contract offered by that community.</p><p><strong>Continuing care retirement communities may offer financial assistance</strong></p><p>Many CCRCs can help you find bridge financing to help bridge the time between the sale of your current home and moving in to the community, among other possible financial resources.</p><p>“Check with the community you’re interested in to find out about financial options they may have that may not be advertised,” advises Jill Trapp, marketing director for The Spires. “For example, we work with potential residents on finding creative solutions to help with their financial needs.”</p><p><strong>Moving in sooner can save you money</strong></p><p>Over the long term, the sooner you make your move to a CCRC, the less expensive it will be. Many communities offer an easy-to-use online calculation tool that can help you determine if moving there would be a good financial fit for you.

Don’t ignore your debt.Tackling debt can be intimidating, but also can’t be ignored. Make a game plan to strengthen your financial situation and get yourself back on track.

            "body": "If you're a frequent traveler to popular vacation hotspots like Orlando or Las Vegas there’s a good chance you’ve been approached by someone and asked to attend a timeshare sales pitch, often in exchange for a heavily discounted vacation or free tickets to a show or theme park.And while you may not dread a timeshare sales presentation, you can probably think of other ways you'd rather spend your limited vacation time.Timeshare sales presentations are designed to better understand travelers’ vacation preferences and to show off the resorts where they’ll stay if they decide to become owners. And while the sales presentation is generally straightforward, it’s understandable to be apprehensive about the experience.Here’s what to expect during a timeshare sales presentation and four steps to prepare for the experience.1. Deal with a reputable company. Yes, timeshares have a certain reputation, but much of it is based on outdated stereotypes. There are a number of highly reputable timeshare companies like Hilton Grand Vacations, which are associated with major hotel brands that have earned consumers’ trust over decades. That said, just as in any industry, there are some unscrupulous operators. Before agreeing to sit through a timeshare sales pitch or accepting a discounted trip, make sure the company is on the up and up. Check for complaints at state Attorney General office websites or consumer protection bureaus.Be aware that if you accept a discounted trip, you need to attend the sales presentation. If you don't, you could be on the hook for the full cost of the trip.2. Go in with an open mind. If the company’s goal is to get you interested in buying a timeshare, it’s in their best interest to make the presentation a good experience for you. Expect the sales representative to start by asking you lots of questions about how you like to travel, where you like to go and who usually travels with you. Those answers will help them customize the presentation to you. Think of it like house shopping — and you are, kind of. A good real estate agent won't show you a one-bedroom apartment in the city if you're looking for a farmhouse. A good timeshare sales representative will tailor the sales presentation to meet your specific interests.“We want our guests to enjoy themselves and feel great about the experience. After all, we’re rooted in hospitality,” said Derek DeSalvia, senior vice president, Hilton Grand Vacations, a timeshare company. “Of course, we want people who attend our presentations to become Hilton Grand Vacations owners, but only if it fits their lifestyle and is something they’re excited about. We have more than 325,000 owners and growing around the world. The only way that happens is by having satisfied customers.”3. Do your homework – including the math. You wouldn't walk into a car dealership and buy a car after talking to the sales guy for an hour. It's too big of a purchase to do that. The same is true for a timeshare. The best time to do your research into how timeshares work is before the visit. Does it make sense financially and based on the vacation lifestyle you want? By the time you show up to the sales presentation, it's more like the test drive. You already have a sense of the features and benefits; now you just want to see the paint color. Get answers to any lingering questions you have to ensure you feel good about whatever decision you make.Questions to consider include:4. Don't feel pressured. Just because you agreed to attend a sales presentation to see if you might be interested in buying a timeshare, don’t feel pressured. If you’ve already checked out the company’s reputation, done your homework and done the math, and decided that a timeshare fits your lifestyle, you may be ready to buy. If you need more time, that’s OK, too.To learn more about timeshare sales tours and even what timeshare costs, visit hiltongrandvacations.com."

            "body": "It’s no secret that 2020 has been a tumultuous year. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many Americans found themselves out of work — at least temporarily — and received unemployment benefits. Others may have experienced employment changes, like working from home or taking on multiple jobs. All of these factors will have even more of an impact come time to file income taxes on tax day, April 15, 2021.“For many, the 2020 tax season will likely look different,” says Mark Steber, Chief Tax Information Officer at Jackson Hewitt Tax Services. “The pandemic brought unexpected, overwhelming changes.”To help you prepare and get the maximum tax refund you deserve, Steber offers the following tax tips.1. Understand how unemployment benefits workIf you received unemployment benefits this year, it may have been for the first time. Make sure you’re aware of how they affect your taxes.Unemployment benefits are taxable and must be reported to the IRS on your tax return. Taxable benefits also include any special compensation authorized under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act earlier this year. That means if you did not withhold enough taxes from your unemployment benefits, you could see a big tax bill or a much smaller tax refund than you normally receive.Unemployment benefits can affect tax credits. Unemployment is considered unearned income, so it won’t count toward certain credits. For example, you must have earned income to qualify for the Child Tax Credit or the Earned Income Tax Credit. Additionally, your adjusted gross income must be below certain levels to get certain credits.2. Set money aside to cover unexpected taxesIf you received unemployment benefits and did not withhold any federal or state income tax, you’ll need to pay tax on that money. To prepare, consider setting money aside now to cover those taxes on your 2020 return and brace yourself for a much smaller refund or no refund at all this tax season.3. Take advantage of possible deductionsEvery taxpayer will get a charitable donation deduction for 2020. Make a list of any IRS-approved donations you made this year and locate any receipts. Whether itemizing or taking the standard deduction, under the CARES Act, all taxpayers are eligible to deduct up to $300 worth of monetary donations to qualified organizations.And while many Americans have been working at home for months, a home office deduction is not guaranteed. The home office deduction is only available to those who are self-employed.4. Consider major life changesLife goes on, even during a pandemic, and life changes can bring sizeable tax implications. Some changes that cause the biggest impact include getting married or divorced, having a baby or adopting a child, buying or selling property, retiring, or starting a business. If you experienced any of these events in 2020, know that your return will look different.5. Keep track of important documentsEven if your taxes won’t be affected by unemployment, make sure you gather all your documents, such as W-2 forms and 1099s for interest dividends and even retirement distributions. Remember to include the Notice 1444 you received with your stimulus check for your 2020 tax records. Collect your charitable contribution totals, mortgage interest, property taxes you’ve paid, and any additional state and local income taxes paid for the year. If you were furloughed and able to pick up a temporary job, gather your W-2s for each job you worked. If you worked a side gig, make sure to keep a record of your income, the miles you drove, and any additional expenses. And if you’re not filing single, be on the lookout for family members that may have been impacted to make your tax return more complicated.No matter your 2020 situation, follow these tips to prepare for any unexpected tax implications.

            "body": "Over the past several months, everyone’s lives have been upended, with consequences nobody predicted. One unexpected result of the pandemic? A real estate boom.With so many more people working from home, people are re-evaluating their living spaces, including those who need to factor in homeschooling. Some families are realizing they need more bedrooms, larger yards or just more space in general. Others who have suffered financial setbacks may be looking to downsize. And many city dwellers are trying to move away from congested areas to smaller towns or suburbs. All of these changes, plus the low mortgage rates, have resulted in plenty of activity in the housing market.If you’re one of the many Americans considering a move, here are some tips to navigating the process successfully right now.1. Check your creditLong before you make any large purchase, whether it’s a car or a home, you should check your credit score and your credit report.Before you even start scoping out neighborhoods, visit AnnualCreditReport.com, a site where you can access for free your credit report — these days, on a weekly basis. Also be sure to review the report to ensure there are no errors. You can also check your VantageScore credit score for free at websites like CreditKarma.com, MyLendingTree.com and MyCreditGuide from American Express.The VantageScore model, widely used by lenders, helps both consumers and lenders by providing a more accurate representation of the risk for someone to default on a payment on his/her loan. It also provides more consistent scores regardless of which national credit reporting company provides your score, which is helpful especially for first-time home buyers.If your credit score is not up to par, improve it by:No matter which strategies you use, allow a few months for your improved credit habits to show up on your report before applying for a mortgage.2. Get pre-qualified for a mortgageBeing pre-qualified makes you a much more attractive buyer.The first step in getting pre-qualified is checking your credit score (see above).Next, crunch some numbers. You’ll need to figure out your debt-to-income ratio (DTI) based on the anticipated mortgage monthly payment: How much (percentage) of your gross monthly income goes toward debt (student loans, credit cards, car payments, etc.)? Most mortgage lenders look for a DTI of 36% or lower. If your DTI is high, see if you can decrease your debt by paying some down and/or increase your income (perhaps with a part-time job).Apply with a number of lenders — some will give you better rates than others. Before applying, ask what information and documents you (and your co-borrower, if there is one) will need. This will include proof of employment and income, plus previous tax returns.Also, be sure to apply to all the lenders within a span of two weeks. That way, only one “credit inquiry” will impact your VantageScore credit score.3. Take advantage of virtual home toursSave time and stay safe by touring homes virtually while you're in the initial stages of house-hunting. Once you've narrowed down your choices, you can ask about visiting properties in person, following safety protocols.4. Leave your emotions at the doorWhether you're buying and/or selling, don't let the emotions of the moment push you into making a hasty decision. Make sure you know your budget and the acceptable terms or conditions for the purchase (or sale). If the seller (or buyer) suddenly changes something about the deal — from the closing date to the offer or asking price — don't make a snap decision. Tell them you'll think about it overnight and discuss it with your real estate agent. Weigh the pros and cons before agreeing.For more financial tips and information about credit, visit www.yourvantagescore.com."

            "body": "Finances are consistently a top concern for many Americans, with “saving money” a top-10 most common New Year’s resolution. This year, Americans are more concerned than ever before due to the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic. USE Credit Union reported that more than 75% of non-transactional calls received since the start of the pandemic were from members concerned about their financial future, citing economic hardship as the primary reason for concern. The economy and job market remain in a state of constant flux, which is causing many families to worry about their ability to pay an unexpected bill, continue to pay off student loans, mortgages or credit card debt, or save money for the future.“Saving money is more than just putting spare change into a coffee can, or simply ordering takeout less often,” said Jeff Schroeder, vice president and chief product officer at Mercury Insurance. “Sure, those things can add up over time, but people may find that their greatest savings can come from taking a look at the necessary expenses they pay for every month, such as insurance.”Schroeder recommends these four tips to help protect your finances in the coming year:1) Check your auto insurance coverages. There’s no reason to pay for more coverage than you need, but being underinsured can leave you exposed. “The cost of repairs after a collision has grown in recent years, both as a result of more crossovers and SUVs on the road, and more technologically advanced vehicles,” said Schroeder. “Beyond paying for more expensive repairs if your insurance doesn’t cover it, if you’re underinsured, you may also be responsible for paying out of pocket for medical bills, which could potentially devastate savings for a down payment on a house, your child’s college tuition or a future vacation. It’s vitally important to make sure you have the right amount of auto insurance coverage to protect against unforeseen events.”2) Know what your homeowners insurance covers. First and foremost, be sure to read your homeowners insurance policy so you’re clear about what it does and doesn’t cover. It’s a good idea to check in with your insurance agent each year to ensure you have adequate coverage, especially if you’ve made renovations, own collectible or valuable items, or live in an area that’s prone to flooding or earthquakes, as standard homeowners insurance policies typically don’t cover these situations. Also, maintain a home inventory to make sure to have an accurate record of your belongings and property.3) Be aware of potential gaps in coverage. A standard homeowners insurance policy often doesn’t cover mechanical failures to your home’s appliances, HVAC or other essential systems, nor does it cover a break to service lines on your property that supply your home with electricity, gas or sewer functions. In either of these scenarios, this means you would be responsible for writing a big check to a repair company or having to purchase a pricy replacement. However, adding home systems protection and service line protection endorsements can help provide coverage for costly repairs and replacements, saving money and your peace of mind. Pennies spent now can save you thousands of dollars later.4) Regularly shop for the best coverage and price. Insurance prices can vary significantly from company to company, so it’s a good idea to take a few minutes to see if you’re getting a good deal. Shop around at least once a year — making sure to look for the exact same coverage limits — to see if you can find a more affordable rate.“Often, regional insurers like Mercury Insurance are more attuned to their policyholders' needs and can offer better rates,” Schroeder added. “For example, the California Department of Insurance found that Mercury auto insurance policyholders save an average of $670, which can go a long way in feeling more secure in your savings.”The most effective way to make sure your finances are minimally impacted by insurance costs in 2021 is to speak to an independent insurance agent. They can help make sure you have the proper amount and type of coverage to keep yourself, your family and property protected."

Especially when money is tight, it's a challenge to shop for just the right gifts for your loved ones and BFFs. But with a bit of planning, holiday shopping can be just as fun as ever — without clearing out your bank account or piling on credit card debt.Smart holiday shopping starts with a clear strategy — so get out your tablet or notebook and get started ASAP.1. Create a budgetKnowing your realistic gift-giving budget can save you headaches down the road. Consider your monthly income and your usual expenses when figuring out how much you can realistically spend on your friends and fam this year.2. Make a list and check it twiceYour budget got you worried? Consider who you really need and want to shop for — and what they really want.Maybe your mom would prefer an hour’s worth of Facetime with you so you can chat while you do a craft or your nails together, instead of another knickknack or tchotchke for her dresser. Perhaps your dad would really love a coupon book for doing some yardwork for him, instead of a tie. Think about homemade or handcrafted items your loved ones might really enjoy instead of something you need to buy.3. Use a smart budgeting appWant to take advantage of a Cyber Monday deal, but worried about blowing your budget? You can buy now and pay later — with no interest — using a smart budgeting app.The payments will be automatically charged to the account you provide. And if you're shopping in-store, touch and go with the app for safer, contactless shopping.The best news? There’s no hard credit check or impact on your credit score. It’s a stress-free way to handle bigger-ticket items you want for your special someone — but need to spread out payments over time to manage your finances smartly.Download the app from the Apple App Store or Google Play — or visit Quadpay.com to learn more.4. Keep an eye on the salesYes, you can use the Quadpay app to catch the best deals on Black Friday, Small Business Saturday and Cyber Monday. But if you don't snag the items at the top of your list by then, holiday sales are still likely to show up over the next few weeks. Retailers are pulling out all the stops to entice consumers this year, so keep your eye on prices for items you want both during and after the big name sales days.Research online for a sense of what regular prices are for these items, so you’ll know a bargain when you see one. Keep a running list, and search online and in-store options where the same or similar products might be available for less.And don’t panic if a website claims there’s only two left — chances are that’s just a sales tactic to get you to buy now.5. Shop earlyWhile you may not have seen the perfect deal on that one special item, don’t wait until the last minute to finish your shopping. Most retailers offer free shipping with any purchase, or purchases over a certain amount. If you wait too late, you can run into trouble — you don't want to have to pay extra for expedited shipping just because the gifts you ordered can’t arrive on time. Avoid shipping fees by giving your loved ones gifts cards if you find the calendar slipping away from you!Take the time now to plan your strategy. With these tips, you can shop smartly for a much less stressful, much merrier holiday season."

            "body": "In the winter, keeping the cold out and the heat in is everything. For many busy homeowners, it can be easy to overlook a few simple preventive maintenance tasks before cold weather sets in. Doing so can reduce the risk of home damage and help maximize energy efficiency. So before frigid temperatures are here for good, you can use this list to make sure your house is shipshape.Check for exterior gaps and cracksTake a walk around the exterior of your home. Get up close and inspect the windows, the siding and the doorways to check for cracks or gaps that need fixing and caulking. Plugging the gaps and making necessary repairs can help you keep the cold out. Because the freeze-thaw cycle can exacerbate these gaps, you’ll want to get ahead of that damaging cycle and fix these today.Check your attic insulationHeat rises, and the layers of insulation are an important barrier between you and the cold. The more the insulation settles, the less effective it is. So if it’s been a few years, take a peek at the upstairs crawl space. If it’s sunken below the floor joists, it may be time to replace it. While you’re up there, take a flashlight and check the roof and joists for signs of leaks, rot and popped nails.Give your heating system a checkupBefore the first snowfall, it’s always wise to contact your HVAC technician for a heating system checkup. They can give it a tune up, check for problems — and if it’s getting up there in years, can tell you if it’s time to invest in a replacement. If you’re ready to upgrade your system, ask your HVAC provider about technologies like LGRED° (reliable to extreme degrees). This new heat technology from LG Electronics delivers superior heating performance, continuous heating operations down to -13°F and remarkable energy efficiency — ultimately helping your family stay comfortably warm during even the coldest winter day.Clean out the guttersLeaf debris in your gutters today can lead to roof and gutter damage tomorrow. But when the snow thaws, these leaves can move downstream, and end up plugging up your downspouts. A big sign of this is hanging icicles from the roof. These form when you don’t leave a clear path for the snowmelt, and that creates a dangerous situation when they fall. Plugged up gutters can also leave ice dams on your roof, which can cause leaky ceilings.Have a smart winter window strategyIn colder months, your windows can help or hurt the cause of conserving energy. If window replacement isn’t in the cards this year, the next best thing is to winterize. In drafty areas, use window caulk and plastic sheeting. Remember, the sun’s lower angle can be an advantage this time of year; use it. By day, open the blinds and drapes so the thermal effect provides a bit of “free” heat, but keep them closed at night to keep the chill from creeping in.By catching these small issues early, you’ll feel good knowing your house is ready for the snow, ice and cold. Before winter is here to stay, ask your HVAC provider about the latest technology and ENERGY STAR certified products from leading brands like LG. To learn more, visit lghvac.com."

If window replacement isn’t in the cards this year, the next best thing is to winterize. In drafty areas, use window caulk and plastic sheeting. Remember, the sun’s lower angle can be an advantage this time of year; use it. By day, open the blinds and drapes so the thermal effect provides a bit of “free” heat, but keep them closed at night to keep the chill from creeping in.</p><p>By catching these small issues early, you’ll feel good knowing your house is ready for the snow, ice and cold. Before winter is here to stay, ask your HVAC provider about the latest technology and ENERGY STAR certified products from leading brands like LG.

            "body": "Former California residents Jim and Donna Dickie decided to move across the country to retire in Rome, Georgia, for a whole host of reasons. What they learned when they researched their new home could help you or your loved ones make the crucial decision about where to live next.If you imagine retirement locations, Georgia may not be the first state that springs to mind. But lately, seniors are finding increasing benefits to moving to a retirement community outside the typical list of retiree states. So no matter where you currently live, the amenities for seniors found in a town like Rome, Georgia, may tempt you to consider moving.Here’s what you should look for when choosing your retirement community.Location, location, locationWhy would someone move all the way from sunny California to retire in Georgia? The Dickies found that they liked the town of Rome right away, with its small neighborhood feel, but still offering plenty of arts and culture. It was also close to major cities and airports, so transportation was not an issue. Rome has a temperate climate, but still has changing seasons, which they liked.“I’m from the East Coast, and Jim is a native Californian,” said Donna Dickie. “He can’t get over how friendly the people are here, the southern way of politeness. We also appreciate that there is no smoking in Rome, and no pollution.”The Dickies found that many other communities they considered were in the middle of cities, but their top choice — The Spires at Berry College in Rome — was not. “We didn’t see any sign of urban sprawl at all,” observed Jim. “But everything in downtown Rome is 15 minutes away. And there are bigger cities nearby.”Once they took a tour of the 27,000-acre campus of Berry College, the Dickies found the decision very easy. “Rome is so charming,” said Donna. “And once we saw the floor plans, it kept getting better and better.”The benefits of a CCRCLike the Dickies, you might be considering a move for retirement simply because you no longer want the responsibility of maintaining a home. You and your spouse may or may not have health issues that cause you concern right now.But realistically, your healthcare needs could change in the future. That’s one very good reason to look for a Continuing Care Retirement Community (CCRC), or what is also called a Life Plan Community, that provides suitable accommodations no matter where in the healthcare continuum you are or what your future needs become. At The Spires, options include Independent Living, Assisted Living, Skilled Nursing and Rehab plus Memory Care.Outstanding, accessible healthcare While it’s important to find a CCRC that provides high-quality healthcare in-house, it is also vital for the community to be near top-notch medical facilities, just in case. The Dickies were reassured to learn that their new retirement community was located not far from Floyd Medical Center and Redmond Regional Medical Center.Financial benefitsWhen the Dickies first began their search for a retirement community, they realized there was a huge difference both in terms of living expenses and taxes when they compared their home state of California with other states. It turned out that Georgia was very tax-friendly for seniors.“The taxes in California were ridiculous,” said Jim Dickie. “After doing the research, we realized there’s nothing out there that compares to The Spires unless you want to spend double the amount. In California, near where we lived, there is a beautiful CCRC, but it costs a million dollars to move in — and the view is an eight-lane freeway.”Do your researchThe Dickies kept track of all the information they collected on CCRCs from around the country.“Once you start researching, you start getting lots of emails and invitations from all different communities,” the Dickies said. “We kept folders on all the places that we looked at and made financial comparisons. That helped us get the best bang for our buck with our choice. The Spires is a hidden secret — it cannot be beat.'To learn more about the possibilities for your retirement, visit RetireAtBerry.com or call 706-784-7442."

While the amount of driving we’ll be doing over the next few months is still uncertain, the positive impact on wallets is still there: 70% of Americans say that they have spent less money on gas since the start of the pandemic.And when they do need to fill up the tank, drivers are strategic about it. Since the pandemic, over three-fourths (77%) make a plan to get gas while running errands to limit their time out of the house.2) There are designated errand runs — and designated runners.Americans are also strategic with how and when they leave the house for essentials. Many are not comfortable making a quick run to the store to pick up something they forgot for dinner. Nearly two-thirds (64%) say they now save all of their errands for one day or do curbside orders to limit potential exposure to the virus. Another half (53%) have a designated errand runner, so only one person has to leave the house.3) Rush hour is less rushed.With more Americans continuing to work from home and students taking classes online, rush hour is proving less intense. Nearly two-thirds (63%) of drivers recognize that normal traffic patterns have shifted since the start of 2020. Another 65% confirm there is less traffic on their regular routes — though that largely depends on where you live. Hankook found that drivers in the Northeast saw the most significant impact on their regular traffic flow, where 71% of drivers say their daily routes have fewer cars on the road.4) Comfort levels are shifting gears.As a result of the pandemic, 75% of Americans are not comfortable using public transportation. However, confidence behind the wheel is down, too — just over a third (36%) say they are less confident driving since the start of the pandemic, perhaps because they aren’t doing so as often. Interestingly enough, men are almost twice as likely to say they’re less confident behind the wheel as women … 44% vs. 28%.Additionally, people are careful about who they drive with.

More than half (55%) have a designated spot for it in their vehicles — be it in the glove compartment, center console, rearview mirror, or the gear shift. And 72% say they have hand sanitizer in their vehicle, too.We will have to wait and see which of these trends will stick around and which are more temporary reactions to a tumultuous year.

            "body": "This post is sponsored by Bank of America.Are you dreaming about owning your own home? If so, you’re not alone. And, whatever your timeline, it’s never too early to start planning. Bank of America’s 2020 Homebuyer Insights found that 89 percent of prospective buyers remain motivated to buy their first homes, and four in five consider saving for it a priority. More than half are either on pace or actively accelerating their home purchase plans. That’s not surprising, given today’s favorable interest rates.Despite this optimism, some challenges remain. “Some would-be buyers self-select out of homeownership, assuming they can’t afford a monthly mortgage payment or the upfront costs,” said AJ Barkley, Neighborhood Lending Executive at Bank of America. She added, “Other potential buyers simply don’t know where to start. No matter what stage of home buying process you are in, there are various solutions to make homeownership affordable and sustainable, such as innovative low down payment mortgages, significant down payment and closing cost grants and thought-provoking financial education tools.”So what are the steps to take if you’re ready to start pursuing homeownership? Here are suggestions to get you started.Learn How Home Financing WorksBank of America’s First-Time Homebuyer Online Edu-Series can take away the mystery of the home buying journey and provide you with actionable guidance. The free series, available in English and Spanish, reviews topics from preparing your finances to making an offer on a home to applying for a mortgage. In the series, you’ll hear from a first-time homebuyer as he shares his experience with using down payment and closing costs programs to help him realize the dream of homeownership.Answer the Question: Are You Ready To Buy?First-time homebuyers may be holding off for the “right time,” but there is no such thing because home buying is such a personal decision. While there is no secret formula to assessing emotional and financial readiness, these resources can help you determine how close you are to becoming a homeowner and equip you to move forward. After all, the more informed you are about the home buying process, the better prepared you are to find the best options.Assess Your FinancesNot sure where to start? The Homebuyer Insights found 80 percent of first-time homebuyers needed help understanding what they could afford. Begin by asking yourself, “How much should I borrow?” instead of, “How much could I borrow?” This helps you focus on the amount that comfortably fits your budget. Then, a general rule of thumb is to multiply your monthly income before taxes by 28 percent or use an online affordability calculator to do the math. The resulting dollar amount is typically how much a manageable monthly payment might be, including taxes, insurance, and private mortgage insurance.Research Affordability Resources and Programs If you’re concerned that you may struggle with the upfront costs, be sure to do your homework to find programs and resources which provide financial support and guidance for affordable and sustainable homeownership. For example, Bank of America’s Community Homeownership Commitment offers specific solutions for modest-income and first-time homebuyers, including affordable mortgages, grant programs, resources and expertise.Thanks to low interest rates and lending programs tailor-made for low- and moderate-income and first-time buyers, homeownership may be well within your grasp. Take time now to check out your options and determine whether Bank of America’s mortgage programs could help you realize your dream of becoming a homeowner.This post is sponsored by Bank of America.* Qualified borrowers must meet eligibility requirements including, but not limited to, being owner occupants, meeting certain qualifying income limitations and purchasing a home within a certain geographical area.

If so, you’re not alone. And, whatever your timeline, it’s never too early to start planning. Bank of America’s 2020 <a href=\"https://about.bankofamerica.com/en-us/what-guides-us/2020-homebuyer-insights.html?cm_mmc=EBZ-EnterpriseBrand-_-vanity-_-EB01VN00H9_homebuyersinsights-_-N/A#fbid=Z7cHvo5d2jt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Homebuyer Insights</a> <a href=\"https://about.bankofamerica.com/en-us/what-guides-us/2020-homebuyer-insights.html?cm_mmc=EBZ-EnterpriseBrand-_-vanity-_-EB01VN00H9_homebuyersinsights-_-N/A#fbid=Z7cHvo5d2jt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"></a>found that 89 percent of prospective buyers remain motivated to buy their first homes, and four in five consider saving for it a priority. More than half are either on pace or actively accelerating their home purchase plans. That’s not surprising, given today’s favorable interest rates.</p><p>Despite this optimism, some challenges remain. “Some would-be buyers self-select out of homeownership, assuming they can’t afford a monthly mortgage payment or the upfront costs,” said AJ Barkley, Neighborhood Lending Executive at Bank of America. She added, “Other potential buyers simply don’t know where to start. No matter what stage of home buying process you are in, there are various solutions to make homeownership affordable and sustainable, such as innovative low down payment mortgages, significant down payment and closing cost grants and thought-provoking financial education tools.”</p><p>So what are the steps to take if you’re ready to start pursuing homeownership? Here are suggestions to get you started.</p><p><strong>Learn How Home Financing Works</strong></p><p>Bank of America’s <a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/homebuyer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">First-Time Homebuyer Online Edu-Series</a> can take away the mystery of the home buying journey and provide you with actionable guidance.

In the series, you’ll hear from a first-time homebuyer as he shares his experience with using down payment and closing costs programs to help him realize the dream of homeownership.</p><p><strong>Answer the Question: Are You Ready To Buy?</strong></p><p>First-time homebuyers may be holding off for the “right time,” but there is no such thing because home buying is such a personal decision. While there is no secret formula to assessing emotional and financial readiness, these <a href=\"https://bettermoneyhabits.bankofamerica.com/en/home-ownership\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">resources</a> can help you determine how close you are to becoming a homeowner and equip you to move forward. After all, the more informed you are about the home buying process, the better prepared you are to find the best options.</p><p><strong>Assess Your Finances</strong></p><p>Not sure where to start? The <a href=\"https://newsroom.bankofamerica.com/press-releases/consumer-banking/nearly-90-prospective-homebuyers-remain-motivated-purchase-their\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Homebuyer Insights</a> found 80 percent of first-time homebuyers needed help understanding what they could afford. Begin by asking yourself, “How much should I borrow?” instead of, “How much could I borrow?” This helps you focus on the amount that comfortably fits your budget. Then, a general rule of thumb is to multiply your monthly income before taxes by 28 percent or use an online <a href=\"https://promo.bankofamerica.com/journeytohomebuyer/?subCampCode=77501&amp;sourceCd=18189&amp;dmcode=18097607863\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">affordability calculator</a> to do the math. The resulting dollar amount is typically how much a manageable monthly payment might be, including taxes, insurance, and private mortgage insurance.</p><p><strong>Research Affordability Resources and Programs </strong></p><p>If you’re concerned that you may struggle with the upfront costs, be sure to do your homework to find programs and resources which provide financial support and guidance for affordable and sustainable homeownership. For example, <a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/homeowner\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bank of America’s Community Homeownership Commitment</a> offers specific solutions for modest-income and first-time homebuyers, including affordable mortgages, grant programs, resources and expertise.</p><p>Thanks to low interest rates and lending programs tailor-made for low- and moderate-income and first-time buyers, homeownership may be well within your grasp.

Still many small businesses are facing hardships, and this holiday season, they need our support more than ever.'You can personally help make a difference by considering 10 simple ways to support small businesses:Shop now: No need to wait for a sale or special event. By shopping now you're putting much-needed funds into a small business that is depending on income each month to make ends meet and keep doors open.Reverse shopping: Rather than thinking of the recipient and then where to shop for a gift, think of the shop first and then the recipients that would most like items from that particular business.Go online: For small businesses that offer e-commerce options, be sure to consider online orders that ship directly to your home. This is a safe and convenient way to support your favorite businesses.Shop in person: For businesses with physical locations, visit shops in person if you can use proper safety measures. If you know what you want, many businesses let you order ahead and opt for curbside or doorway pickup as well.Consider gift cards: Not sure what to buy? Gift cards are always one of the most desired gifts, so if you need to send a little love to a loved one, wrap up a gift certificate in a beautiful card and feel good about your present choice.Leave reviews: Online reviews can make a big difference for small businesses in expanding clientele. Go online and leave rave reviews for your favorite stores and why others should support them as well to help spread the word.Be vocal: In addition to online reviews, talk up your favorite small businesses among friends. From independent restaurants to local service providers, use your voice as a powerful tool to build their reputation and support growth.Partnerships: Look for small businesses who partner together to offer products or services that complement each other in packages, such as a gift basket bundle featuring your favorite local treats. You'll support multiple businesses at once and often get a discount compared to buying separately.Double up: For businesses like independent coffee shops or bakeries, consider a larger order. For example, go with that grande latte and order two dozen cookies to share with your neighbors.Be patient: Small businesses are dealing with a multitude of challenges these days, from supply chain holdups to sluggish shipping and beyond. Your kindness is valued and your patience is crucial during these times.'Actions big and small will help make a difference,' says Malkoski.

There’s a lot for everyone to think about — where to apply, the steps involved in the application process and of course, the finances.This year things are certainly more challenging. A recent College Ave Student Loans survey conducted by Barnes and Noble College Insights looked at how the pandemic has changed the approaches most families are taking to paying for college. Over half of the survey respondents (56%) reported that their finances have been negatively affected, with 58% of those families using their savings more than expected, 43% putting off big purchases and 29% leaning on credit cards. Financial setbacks like job loss have caused many families to seek alternatives to help pay for college costs.While you’re planning for your child’s education, it’s important to figure these additional costs into your overall financial picture. Paying for college is not just about tuition, so it’s a good idea to be prepared for additional expenses — and know your options for reducing those costs or covering them.1) Room and boardPaying for a dorm room and meal plan is a big part of student expenses. For freshman year, some schools don't allow students to live off-campus. Make sure to find out the rules for schools your son or daughter is applying to and discuss your family’s preferences.Some students may choose to live off-campus and rent an apartment. Depending on the proximity to campus and the area, it can still be costly.If room and board or off-campus housing isn’t covered by financial aid, those costs can be covered with student loan funds. And some students save money their first year or two by enrolling in a local college or university and living at home.2) Textbooks and suppliesBooks and supplies can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars each year depending on your area of study. You can use student loans to help cover the purchase of a computer, books, required class supplies and school-related fees.Research ways to save on books. Most schools offer used textbooks as an option in their college bookstores, or you can often find used textbooks online. In some cases, you can rent expensive textbooks. In many cases, e-books are much more affordable than actual textbooks.3) TransportationConsider the costs to commute to school every day — parking, gas or public transportation. Don’t forget to factor in any trips home throughout the year that might require a train or airfare.It's essential to know the full cost of attending college when your family is making plans together. Adding these further costs to tuition, you may find that the grants or scholarships your child is offered, on top of federal student loans or work-study options they may be eligible for, will not cover everything for the school year. Unexpected expenses can also come up, such as unanticipated fees or supplies, or a roommate bailing on a shared apartment.If your son or daughter needs additional funds, one option is getting a private student loan through College Ave, which offers competitive rates and a three-minute application. Families have choices about when to start making payments and how long to take to pay back the loan, making it easy for them to balance a monthly budget while minimizing the total cost.To see how much your monthly bills could be upon graduation, explore tools like the College Ave student loan calculator to make sure the loan amount fits your family’s monthly budget."

            "body": "Paid Content by Vanderbilt Mortgage and Finance, Inc.Buying a home is a major life step. Homes are by nature expensive and most home buyers cannot afford to purchase a home outright. Because of that reality, most home buyers finance a home purchase with a mortgage. A mortgage allows you to spread the payments for a home loan across many years. The result? Mortgages can make home ownership much more attainable for the average home buyer.Why now is a great time to buyCurrently, mortgage rates are at historic lows, meaning that the cost of borrowing funds is lower than it has been in previous years. If it fits within your budget, now is a good time to purchase a home. In fact, Vanderbilt Mortgage is offering new home buyers who chose to finance their home purchase with Vanderbilt 60 days with no payments after their mortgage loan funds. This provides a new home buyer time to settle into their new home and pay for the costs associated with moving — without having to immediately account for their first mortgage payment.Benefits to paying a mortgage off fasterWhile mortgages definitely make sense for most home buyers, there are advantages to paying off a mortgage before it reaches full term.Why?Because paying down your mortgage early:Builds equity for resale. Paying down the principal balance on a mortgage can build equity in your home faster. Equity is defined as the market value of the home, minus the amount owed on the mortgage. For example, if your home is worth $150,000 and you owe $100,000 on the mortgage, then you have $50,000 worth of equity in your home. This equity can then be utilized when you sell your home, for a down payment on your next home. In addition, some of the equity could be used to qualify for a home equity loan to make home improvements.Frees up cash for later. Another benefit to paying down your mortgage earlier is reducing the years the mortgage is active. Paying the mortgage off earlier will free up the money that was needed for a monthly mortgage payment, allowing that money to be spent on other items — or saved for retirement or an emergency fund.How to pay off your mortgage fasterIf you’re interested in paying your mortgage off more quickly, here are two common strategies you can use:Extra payments every month. A more common way to pay a mortgage down early is simply to make extra payments to the loan’s principal each month, as frequently as possible. Whether it’s five dollars or one hundred dollars extra per month, every additional principal payment you can make toward paying a mortgage down more quickly really adds up. To show you how that would work, Vanderbilt Mortgage has developed an early payoff calculator to show how much you can save by paying extra toward the principal each month.Annual Additional Payments to Principal – You can also help pay your mortgage off faster by making extra payments to principal once a year. Whether it be a tax refund you receive, yearly bonus or extra savings, this investment toward paying your mortgage off sooner can help save interest cost in the future.Go at your own paceIt’s important to remember not to overextend yourself while you’re working to pay a mortgage down. Create a realistic budget and go at a pace you can afford, and you will reap the long-term benefits. Your future self will thank you!

Whether it be a tax refund you receive, yearly bonus or extra savings, this investment toward paying your mortgage off sooner can help save interest cost in the future.</p><p><strong>Go at your own pace</strong></p><p>It’s important to remember not to overextend yourself while you’re working to pay a mortgage down.

It’s easy to confuse buy now pay later (BNPL) plans with using a credit card or layaway plan. While finances are tight for many, especially during and after the holidays, it’s good to know what plans would work best for your situation, without getting you into financial difficulties down the road.The credit card trapWhen cash is in short supply, especially if you are a recent grad or if you're between jobs, it’s all too easy to max out your credit cards when buying holiday gifts or necessary expenses, from gas for your car to medical bills.But even if you have reasonably good credit and a generous credit limit on a card, relying too heavily on this payment method can lead to financial difficulties in the future. Even if your credit card charges interest that is not too high, any amount adds up over time, especially if you can't pay off the balance. And even worse — if you miss a payment, that can not only lead to fees but will also harm your credit score, making it hard to borrow later if you need a car or bank loan.Especially for anyone still paying down student loans, the lure of credit cards has definitely lost its luster — which is a good thing, in the long run.The old-fashioned layaway planIn your parents’ or grandparents’ day, layaway was a common method for saving up for large expenses, like appliances. But the catch was, you couldn’t take home the item until the total amount was paid off at the retailer.It was a great way for people to save up for later purchases, making sure they didn't overextend their credit. But for today's financial challenges, a plan like this does not help much. The layaway plan has evolved to fit our current needs, and buy now, pay later has revolutionized the way we purchase — like getting the item right away instead of waiting to receive it once it’s paid off.How to buy now, pay laterEnter a new way to make purchases now and pay for it over time without exorbitant interest and fees later.

            "body": "The global COVID-19 pandemic is affecting nearly every part of daily life, and many people are choosing to skip or forgo their medical visits, screenings and tests. For people living with follicular lymphoma (FL), a typically incurable blood cancer that has to be closely managed, the importance of continuing routine check-ins is crucial to ensure doctors can monitor for disease progression or recurrence.FL is a form of blood cancer called non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and it may be non-aggressive, or, aggressive. It originates in the lymphatic system, a system of lymph nodes found throughout the body, including in the neck, underarms, chest, abdomen and groin/pelvis. FL can affect anyone at any age; however, it is more prevalent in white men and women over the age of 60, with slightly higher rates among men. According to the American Society of Clinical Oncology, an estimated 77,000 cases of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma were diagnosed in the United States in 2020. FL typically accounts for 20 percent of diagnosed non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma cases. While common signs of FL include swelling in the lymph nodes and fatigue, some patients may not notice any symptoms. Less common symptoms include fever, night sweats and weight loss or enlarging and persistent lumps that can serve as a warning that the cancer may be progressing.“Follicular lymphoma is a heterogeneous subtype of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, with some patients having a very indolent, or slow growing cancer, and others, much more aggressive disease,” said Lori A. Leslie, MD, of the John Theurer Cancer Center in Hackensack, New Jersey, who specializes in hematology and medical oncology, including cancers like FL. “When discussing long-term treatment plans with patients, I like to focus on the rapidly evolving treatment landscape. With many novel therapies recently approved or in the advanced stages of development, it is important to remain hopeful and to take an individualized approach to treatment.”Following treatment, patients with FL often experience periods of remission before their disease returns. Patients may also become resistant to previous treatments received, as their disease progresses and becomes more difficult to treat.Bob Mesloh, an FL survivor, knows all too well that FL can return at any time. Following his initial diagnosis and round of treatment, Bob was in remission for five years before his FL returned — which his oncologist discovered during a routine check-up. Bob mentioned that many patients may live relatively unaffected by FL, making routine medical visits easy to overlook or miss, especially in a pandemic. Today, Bob lives in Florida cancer-free and is diligent in his follow-up care by continuing to see his oncologist every six months.“I always stress the importance of having routine doctor visits to ensure the best health outcomes, knowing follicular lymphoma can relapse at any time,” said Bob. “Without routine in-person check-ins, patients may not realize if they’ve relapsed.”“Patients and caregivers have many concerns due to COVID-19, including whether they are at risk due to cancer or cancer treatment, and if their ability to get the best treatment will be compromised due to the pandemic,” said Dr. Leslie. “My guidance is to discuss your specific situation with your treating provider to make the best choice together. I encourage patients to stay engaged with their healthcare professionals and encourage their family or friends to do the same. Avoiding a check-up and workup for developing symptoms due to fear of exposure to the healthcare environment can have devastating consequences.”Across the medical field, many safety protocols are in place to ensure patients can visit their doctors in person with the lowest risk possible during the pandemic. If a patient feels uncertain or uncomfortable with an in-person visit, they should call their doctor’s office in advance to learn what precautions are in place and what they can expect during an actual visit.Telemedicine has also become a viable option for staying in touch with healthcare providers, as long as patients understand that virtual visits should not fully replace in-person appointments.A patient’s FL treatment journey should always be informed by continuous, open conversations with their healthcare team to develop a long-term treatment plan that addresses the severity of the disease, taking into consideration available treatment options. Treatment plans should consider several factors including age, other health conditions the patient may have, disease aggressiveness and individual lifestyle needs. The good news is that oral treatment options are available and can be taken from home, which can be helpful during the COVID-19 pandemic.“With an explosion of new, targeted and immune-based therapies over the past few years, it is a very exciting and hopeful time,” said Dr. Leslie. “We are no longer in an era of one-size-fits-all chemoimmunotherapy as the importance of determining a personalized treatment plan for each patient is increasingly apparent.”To learn more about FL, please visit the Lymphoma Research Foundation.Sponsored by Epizyme, Inc.DA-FL-UB-20-0018"

            "body": "The holidays are a time of coming together. While it might look different in 2020, it is even more critical this year to check on aging loved ones who may have been negatively affected by the isolation and loneliness during the ongoing pandemic.But it can be difficult for us to recognize when our loved ones do need extra support. Whether we get busy or wish to show respect for our loved one’s wishes and independence, we don’t always recognize the signs when they need our help. Because the signs often go unnoticed, only 10% of adults aging in place are receiving the care they needed. That’s why it’s important to maintain connections and be honest about the changes you’re seeing.“We must check in on our aging loved ones to make sure they’re doing well,” says Home Helpers CEO and president Emma Dickison. “Changes to appearance, mood, physical mobility or memory can be concerning and might indicate they need a little help with their everyday life.”Here are four aspects of aging that can help adult children notice a change in their loved ones, to know when it’s time to seek additional support.Big changes in physical appearance: Pay attention to any changes you see in their bodies and living spaces. Bruises and cuts can be signs of a recent fall. Note changes in their routine and hygiene. Perhaps their clothes and hair appear uncharacteristically dirty and unkempt. These could be signs of depression, or they need a hand because these tasks have become difficult or painful. Other cues include not preparing their usual meals, a messier than usual living space — anything that shows departures from their usual routines.Signs of memory struggles: We can all have a memory lapse in daily life. Repeating a story, or going through the roster of grandchildren before hitting on the right name can happen to anyone. Instead, be watchful of memory lapses that can create a dangerous situation for your loved one. These may include things like forgetting a meal in a hot oven or repeated incidents of locking themselves out of their home. When these start happening, it’s time to seek additional support, such as a visit to the doctor.Motor skills and the risk of falling: As people increase in age, so does the risk of falling. Older adults lose muscle mass every year (especially if they don’t exercise), and balance can be affected by aging as well as certain medications. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 3 million older adults a year need emergency room care to treat a fall injury. Visible signs of falling include cuts and bruises on the head, arms and hands.Shifts in mood and optimism: Family and social connections are critical for one’s health and well-being. But as the need to maintain social distance gets in the way of the things your loved one enjoys, it can take a toll on their mood and outlook. Pay attention to your loved one’s demeanor when you call or visit. If they seem down, they may be missing their usual lunch dates and games with friends. To fill the gap, look into companion care options that are available in your community. These caregivers will go to your loved one’s home so they can safely play their favorite games, work on hobbies or just have a conversation. Caregivers are specially trained to help keep seniors and other high-risk populations safe and cared for in their homes. Regaining these social dates can give your loved one something to look forward to.As difficult as it is to confront these issues, it’s important to have conversations and come up with a plan to help your loved one stay independent and happy in their home, says Dickison. More than 90% of seniors prefer to age in place and stay in their homes and neighborhoods they've enjoyed for years.“The COVID-19 pandemic has rippled across the country in myriad ways,” she continued. “In dealing with aging seniors who have self-isolated to limit exposure, we want to be sure those living independently at home have the assistance, companionship and care they need.”Home Helpers offers care and companionship, specialized care, wellness calls, 24-hour monitoring, and meals and nutrition planning. They connect caregivers with clients to provide a custom level of assistance and care. Learn more by visiting HomeHelpersHomeCare.com."

            "body": "As being in quarantine and weathering the COVID-19 pandemic continues to put a damper on things, American women are turning to their makeup routines to feel a sense of control and comfort, according to new research.In September, marketing firm OnePoll asked 2,000 American women about how they’re staying positive and confident as their time in quarantine and social distancing drags on. According to the findings, 51% said wearing makeup and changing up their looks turned out to be a small way to help them escape the stress of current affairs.If you’re feeling the need to switch things up, you’re not alone. Read on to discover more survey findings to inspire ideas to help you feel your best.Going for natural beauty: Since the onset of the pandemic, we’ve seen a palpable shift in mood to a more low-key, understated aesthetic. After all, when video meetings and intimate (but open-air) gatherings continue to define our interactions, we may be less focused on going for glam and more on dressing for warmth and casual comfort. For that reason, respondents identified a rise in more natural makeup looks as a key trend of 2021.Leveraging makeup with benefits: A flawless look always starts with healthy-looking radiant skin, no matter how much we’re social distancing. And that’s why for a majority of respondents (60%), products that multi-task get top billing. For example, products that contain vitamin E in the ingredients or improve the skin’s appearance, such as skin smoothing or eliminating the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles are always a win, quarantine or not. To help you achieve that naturally beautiful look you’re after, try Neutrogena Makeup — it's 'makeup fueled by skincare,' and delivers lasting makeup benefits, packed with skin healthy ingredients.The eyes have it: For now, going out means masking up, whether we’re hanging out with friends (while social distancing), eating at a restaurant outdoors, running errands or going on a social-distancing compliant date. Not surprisingly, nearly half of respondents (48%) admit that face masks have transformed their makeup routine. That means the eyes are now pulling focus. (Raise your hand if you’ve attempted smiling with your eyes, or “smizing.”) Sixty percent say they want their eyes to be a standout feature while wearing a face covering. In 2021, watch for the rise of dramatic eye makeup to give the peepers some serious pop.Ready for your screening: Being in quarantine and staying home doesn’t necessarily mean makeup falls by the wayside. When it’s time to make an appearance, say, right before a video meeting, many found a reason to pick up their makeup looks. During our time in, mascara, eyeliner and foundation were the top three products respondents found they couldn’t live without — especially when they were due for a video call for class or work.Getting a mood boost: Being in quarantine and missing out on the things we love doing most can be a downer. While nearly half of respondents (49%) admit to ditching their normal makeup routine, just over a third (36%) say that wearing at least some makeup actually gives their mood a lift. One in four (24%) have gone as far as trying new cosmetics, while just over half (51%) say that using makeup to change up their appearance — perhaps to compensate for the face-covering — lets them feel a sense of control and comfort during a stressful time.During quarantine, making small changes has the power to give you a sense of control and boost your mood. For inspiration, visit neutrogena.comThis online survey of 2,000 American women was commissioned by Neutrogena and conducted by market research company OnePoll, in accordance with the Market Research Society’s code of conduct. Data was collected in Sept. 2020. All participants are paid an amount depending on the length and complexity of the survey. This survey was overseen and edited by the OnePoll research team, who are members of the MRS and have corporate membership to ESOMAR and AAPOR."

Even if your chronic condition is well-controlled, flu can make your condition worse — it can trigger asthma attacks, increase the risk of heart disease and stroke, and make your blood sugar harder to manage. Flu vaccination is recommended to protect you from severe flu-related illness and help keep your chronic condition under control.Every year, flu is responsible for millions of illnesses, tens of thousands of hospitalizations and thousands of deaths. Last flu season, 9 out of 10 adults hospitalized with flu had at least one reported underlying medical condition. The most commonly reported underlying medical conditions in patients hospitalized for flu include heart disease, diabetes, obesity and chronic lung disease. A flu shot reduces your risk of getting sick with flu, but even if getting a flu shot does not completely prevent flu infection, some studies show that it can help reduce the severity of illness and prevent complications that can result in hospitalization and death.Getting vaccinated against flu is always extra important for people with certain chronic conditions, but as the U.S. battles the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s more important than ever. Flu and COVID-19 together could overwhelm our medical systems. A flu shot this season can help protect you from flu and reduce your risk of needing medical care for flu-related complications. We can all do our part to reduce the spread of flu and protect our loved ones and our community from flu, saving medical resources to care for COVID-19 patients.There’s still time to get a flu shot. “Flu activity is still low right now, which means it’s a good time to get vaccinated,” says Dr. Dan Jernigan, Influenza Division Director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We don’t know what this season will bring, but we know that a flu vaccine can reduce the risk from flu. Part of our preparedness strategy this winter is to take flu out of the equation as much as possible. Getting a flu vaccine can help do that so there is one less thing to worry about.” Hundreds of millions of flu shots have been safely given in the United States for decades. Data show that getting a flu shot is the best way to protect against flu.Reduce your risks from flu this season. Get vaccinated now to protect yourself, your loved ones and your community from flu.

            "body": "The coronavirus pandemic has shed light on the dangers of rampant overuse of harsh chemicals in products we use every day to clean our skin, homes, offices and public spaces — making natural and skin-friendly cleaning solutions more important than ever. A recent CDC study, “Cleaning and Disinfectant Chemical Exposures and Temporal Associations with COVID-19,” warns Americans to be vigilant when using harsh cleaning products (including sprays, wipes and hand sanitizers), citing a dramatic increase in accidental poisonings compared to the last two years. For example, in 2020 alone, U.S. poison control centers responded to 18,292 exposure cases from hand sanitizer in children 12 years and under. Additionally, the FDA recalled 178 alcohol hand sanitizer products that contained dangerous and toxic ingredients for humans, pets and plants — like methanol and 1-propanol.So, what is safe? Here’s a short list:1. The base for most disinfectants contains toxic chemicals like alcohol, bleach and acid, which quickly lose their effectiveness. In contrast, Disinfect &amp; Shield Surface Cleaner kills on contact and protects for 28 days against viruses, bacteria, molds and fungi, such as strains of SARS, H1N1, E. Coli, and harmful microbes, including the coronavirus. Extensive third party and university testing has proven the product’s effectiveness as none of these organisms were able to penetrate or survive contact with the protective coating. Disinfect &amp; Shield is both eco-friendly and safe for use around humans, animals and plants — including crops. Any place where people gather to work or play should be kept free from harmful elements, which is why airports, airlines, hospitals, bars, night clubs and fitness facilities are all reconsidering their cleaning protocols, especially around food preparation. Disinfect &amp; Shield is safe to use on personal protective equipment to provide additional safety and confidence to first responders and medical professionals. Additionally, the FDA-listed Disinfect &amp; Shield 8-Hour Hand Sanitizer has been proven effective against SARS-Cov-2, harmful bacteria and viruses for up to 8 hours and 10 hand washings. It lasts 700x longer than leading alcohol-based hand sanitizers. While the Laundry Complete sanitizes, deodorizes, and softens all fabrics during washing cycle providing virus, bacteria, and germ protection for up to 200 days after cycle.2. With as many as 45% of Americans reporting sensitive skin, it is important to take into account how many commonly used household items contain allergens or irritants that might cause skin irritation and discomfort. Many laundry detergents include chemicals and ingredients like surfactants, parabens, dyes and artificial fragrances. Instead, choose skin-friendly substitutions to ensure the health and well-being of your family is protected. Hypoallergenic Arm and Hammer Sensitive Skin, Free &amp; Clear Laundry Detergent is a preservative-free and safe detergent to clean everything from clothing to household linens to protect skin from harsh, reaction-producing allergens.3. The harsh chemicals suggested to kill SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, as well as other dangerous viruses, bacteria, E. coli, Salmonella, Staph and MRSA also kill the good bacteria. Our environments and bodies need these good bacteria to fight infections and protect our immune systems, making it critical to add environmental probiotics to our cleaning regimens at home, in office buildings and in public places. Chemical-free P2 Probiotic Power products offer external probiotic technology to deliver a stronger defense barrier than antibacterial products, disinfectants and bleach. Our environment, just like our body, has an immune system that plays a key role in our overall health. The best way to boost and balance the environmental immune system is to use P2 probiotics to replenish and correct the balance of good bacteria on surfaces, in the air, on your skin and in/on your pets. If we continue to use cleaning products with harsh chemicals that kill good bacteria, we will see more virulent strains of superbug bacteria, mold, fungus and mildew — because microbes always have the last word.Remember: take caution when using traditional household cleaners containing alcohol, bleach, and acid as they quickly lose their effectiveness, destroy surfaces, and harm skin. Instead opt for external probiotics that replenish the good bacteria that help us stay healthy and protected. In addition, look for products that not only kill viruses and bacteria, but also offer long-term protection against them and prevent dangerous organisms from attaching. Now more than ever, make sure to choose skin-friendly surface cleaners, laundry detergents, and hand sanitizers to keep your loved ones healthy, comfortable, and safe."

This year alone, roughly 1.8 million people will be diagnosed with cancer in the United States, according to the National Cancer Institute. Nearly 1,700 lives are lost to cancer every day.Despite numerous advances in oncology — the field of medicine that treats cancer — cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and is projected to become the first. That’s in large part because most cancers go undetected until it is too late because there is no early screening available today for the majority of deadly cancers.

In fact, cancers without available screening tests account for 71% of all cancer deaths in the U.S.The importance of early detectionMedical experts agree that early detection of cancer saves lives and directly correlates with the ability to treat the disease successfully. Because screenings exist for only five types of cancer when there are more than 100 types in total, the most pressing unmet need in cancer early detection is to identify cancers for which there are no existing recommended screening tests.“Late stage cancer detection is deadly,” says Joshua Ofman, MD, MSHS, chief medical officer and external affairs at GRAIL, a company whose mission is to detect cancer early, when it can be cured. “The five-year survival rate of a person diagnosed with cancer once it has already spread is just 21%, compared to an 89% survival rate of someone whose cancer is found in early stages.

            "body": "While some people with a COVID-19 infection may experience relatively mild symptoms (or no symptoms at all), the disease is of greater concern for the 56% of Americans who may have at least one risk factor linked to an increased chance of complications.Two increasingly common risk factors for COVID-19 are obesity and type 2 diabetes, which in some cases may be improved or even reversed with appropriate lifestyle modifications. As the COVID-19 situation evolves, it is important to recognize that daily decisions related to diet and activity may make a difference in the severity of infection. Research shows people with existing diabetes whose blood sugar is well controlled may require fewer medical interventions and are more likely to recover from COVID-19.With health now top of mind for many Americans, hopefully these challenging times can serve as a spark to help our nation address its long-standing chronic disease epidemic, which affects more than 196 million people and accounts for over $3 trillion in annual health care costs.Here are tips to consider related to obesity and type 2 diabetes amid the COVID-19 pandemic:Monitor your body mass. While body mass index (BMI) has potential shortcomings, especially for athletes such as weightlifters, this calculation of height compared to weight may provide a helpful measure to monitor. In fact, people with even moderately elevated BMI levels may have an increased risk of developing complications related to diabetes. To monitor your BMI, check with your primary care physician or use an online calculator.Use interval eating. The cliché “you are what you eat” may ring true when it comes to preventing or managing obesity and diabetes, but when and how you eat also may be relevant. Also called intermittent fasting or time-restricted eating, this approach alternates periods of fasting and non-fasting during the day or across the week. Lifestyle changes to consider include waiting at least an hour after waking up before eating breakfast and avoiding food within three hours of sleep. In addition, people may consider the order in which they eat food, starting each meal with a lean protein (chicken, fish or turkey), followed by a vegetable (asparagus, broccoli or carrots) and ending with a carbohydrate (beans, brown rice or sweet potato). This ordered approach may lead to lower post-meal glucose and insulin levels for people with type 2 diabetes. People interested in this approach to eating should discuss it with their health care provider, as medication regimens may need to be adjusted.After-meal walks. People seeking to better control their blood sugar levels and weight should also consider short walks after eating meals or snacks, especially those with added sugars that may be contained in juice or desserts. Post-meal walks may help the body move sugar from the blood into muscle cells, helping normalize blood sugar levels. Whenever possible, make time for a 15-minute walk after each meal to help reduce the risk of blood sugar spikes.Take advantage of technology. Smartwatches and activity trackers are potential resources to help monitor various health measures, including daily steps, sleep patterns and blood sugar levels. Recently, some people with diabetes have started using continuous glucose monitors. This technology, which uses a sensor often worn on the abdomen, continuously reads glucose levels and transmits the data to a smartphone. This may give users and health care providers important information in real time, helping reveal relationships between eating, exercise and blood sugar that may be difficult to observe with only test strips and a glucose meter. While these devices may cost $500 or more and require a prescription, health plans such as UnitedHealthcare are starting to provide these at no additional cost to members as part of diabetes management programs.“Connected devices such as continuous glucose monitors and activity trackers may be game changers for the approximately 30 million people nationwide living with type 2 diabetes,” said Dr. Donna O’Shea, chief medical officer of population health management, UnitedHealthcare. “By considering these tips, these challenging times may serve as a catalyst for people to help improve their health and reduce the possible risk of complications from COVID-19.”Information provided is for general purposes only and is not intended to be construed as medical advice; people should consult an appropriate health care professional to determine what may be right for them."

            "summary": "",
            "body": "Almost a quarter of the population will develop a bunion, a bump at the base of the big toe, with symptoms that include pain, swelling, numbness and pressure.1 Although a bunion visually appears at the base of the toe, the root cause is actually located in the middle of the foot where an unstable joint has allowed the bone to become misaligned.Research shows that 87% of bunions are complex “three dimensional” deformities where the joint can lean, elevate and rotate out of its natural position.2 Many people with bunions report that discomfort and pain keep them from being active.A common misconception is that a bunion can simply be shaved off in a surgical procedure called an “osteotomy.” While this can reduce the cosmetic appearance of the bunion bump, up to 70% of patients can experience recurrence.3 This occurs because traditional bunionectomies address the bunion in only two dimensions and do not address the root cause of the deformity. Recently, a treatment called LAPIPLASTY® 3D BUNION CORRECTION™ has demonstrated low recurrence by targeting all three dimensions of a bunion. In one study, 99% of patients treated had no recurrence after 17 months.4“I meet with patients regularly who report that the pain generated by bunions is severe and makes it very difficult to be active. With the Lapiplasty® Procedure, we can use precision technology to realign the bone, secure the joint — fixing the problem at the root cause — and getting patients back on their feet quickly in a boot,” said Dr. J.P. McAleer of Jefferson City Medical Group in Jefferson City, MO.The Lapiplasty® Procedure works by restoring the natural anatomy of the foot. There is no need to cut and shift the metatarsal bone as with 2D osteotomy surgery. The entire metatarsal bone is simply rotated back into position, eliminating the unsightly bump. The unstable joint is then permanently secured with patented titanium plates and screws.“In our practice, many patients are back on their feet in a walking boot within days. Within six to eight weeks they are wearing comfortable shoes and after four months they are released to full activity — including running,” said Dr. McAleer.The low recurrence data resonated with Dr. McAleer’s marathoner patient April, as she had friends who previously had failed 2D corrections. “I wanted to fix it right the first time.” The possibility of accelerated weight-bearing was also of interest as April hoped to return to running quickly. “I went back to running as soon as the boot came off! At about five months post-op, I ran my first 10K. Ten months after surgery, I did a half marathon.”More than 20,000 patients in the U.S. have been treated with Lapiplasty® 3D Bunion Correction™.

            "html": "<p>Almost a quarter of the population will develop a bunion, a bump at the base of the big toe, with symptoms that include pain, swelling, numbness and pressure.<sup>1</sup> Although a bunion visually appears at the base of the toe, the root cause is actually located in the middle of the foot where an unstable joint has allowed the bone to become misaligned.</p><p>Research shows that 87% of bunions are complex “three dimensional” deformities where the joint can lean, elevate and rotate out of its natural position.<sup>2</sup> Many people with bunions report that discomfort and pain keep them from being active.</p><p>A common misconception is that a bunion can simply be shaved off in a surgical procedure called an “osteotomy.” While this can reduce the cosmetic appearance of the bunion bump, up to 70% of patients can experience recurrence.<sup>3</sup> This occurs because traditional bunionectomies address the bunion in only two dimensions and do not address the root cause of the deformity. Recently, a treatment called LAPIPLASTY<sup>®</sup> 3D BUNION CORRECTION™ has demonstrated low recurrence by targeting all three dimensions of a bunion. In one study, 99% of patients treated had no recurrence after 17 months.<sup>4</sup></p><p>“I meet with patients regularly who report that the pain generated by bunions is severe and makes it very difficult to be active. With the Lapiplasty<sup>®</sup> Procedure, we can use precision technology to realign the bone, secure the joint — fixing the problem at the root cause — and getting patients back on their feet quickly in a boot,” said Dr. J.P. McAleer of Jefferson City Medical Group in Jefferson City, MO.</p><p>The Lapiplasty<sup>®</sup> Procedure works by restoring the natural anatomy of the foot.

If you are like other surveyed servicemembers this year, you are prioritizing low cost of living, low crime rates, and access to outdoor activities. What’s more, you probably are looking for somewhere that that fits with your personality and can give you a sense of community. You want a place to call home and grow roots.“Every year, roughly 250,000 servicemembers transition to civilian life. This can be a difficult and confusing change that includes everything from revisiting your finances to moving,' says Clay Stackhouse, retired Marine Corps Colonel and Regional Outreach Manager at Navy Federal Credit Union. “You might prefer city living with public transportation or rural living with more space. It’s up to you and your individual needs.”To create the list, Navy Federal surveyed 1,000 veterans and civilians about quality of life metrics, such as cost of living, housing affordability, access to recreational activities, proximity to health resources and transportation, and more. Those results were used to rank over 400 U.S. cities based on how they met transitioning servicemembers’ needs.The 2020 Best Cities After Service listCharleston, South CarolinaA city known for its hospitality, Charleston boasts low housing costs, access to cultural and natural activities, and a robust history.

For their award-winning restaurants, product lines, cookbooks and TV shows, they draw inspiration from the bountiful fresh ingredients the Golden State has to offer.“California is my favorite place in the world to cook,” said Puck. “The climate is such that we can get the best ingredients — the freshest produce, fish, nuts — with so much flavor.”It’s this same culinary opportunity that drew French-born Hirigoyen, the chef and owner of Piperade in San Francisco, to California. “The food revolution — knowing where food comes from, how nutritious it is, and supporting the people who grow it — was happening in California, so I came to progress, and with all we have available, continue to progress.”One California crop that has captured these chefs’ collective imagination of late? Pistachios.'I find their flavor and crunch irresistible and I love the color,' said L.A.-based chef Silverton. 'It's really easy to add pistachios to almost anything you make. Their flavor enhances other ingredients so well, but they can also be the star of a dish.”“The great thing about pistachios is they are just the right size, and they add flavor, color and texture to your dish, on top of all the nutritional benefits,” said Yan.Long a popular snack, the trend of using pistachios for cooking appears to be spreading beyond California. American Pistachio Growers, the trade organization of pistachio farmers in the western United States, reports the sale of pistachio kernels, or unshelled nuts, domestically has risen 14%, and represents 22% of all pistachio sales. Representatives cite the reason as a combination of the increase in people preparing meals at home since the outbreak of COVID-19, and the desire for healthy ingredients.Pistachios are nutrient-dense and high in protein. Earlier this year, pistachios earned the status of being a “complete protein,” making them popular among people following a plant-based diet. In July, a university study underscored the importance of pistachios as part of weight-loss programs.With the world’s top chefs adding more pistachio-inspired dishes to their menus, the little green nut is suddenly red hot.

            "body": "It’s no secret that the holidays look much different this year, but those changes may be even more noticeable for individuals who are at high-risk for COVID-19. No one knows this better than Dayna, a mother and caregiver to four children with a rare disease which has caused them to be immune compromised. This leads to an increased chance of an infection, which may be harder to fight off. A diagnosis can be difficult, but once identified, treatments are available, such as therapies developed from plasma. While Dayna and her children — Charlie (20), Kate (18), Thomas (16) and Grace (8) — are taking extra safety precautions this holiday season, the pandemic hasn’t stopped them from raising awareness of the urgency for new plasma donations that will make their therapies possible.When her children were diagnosed with their rare disease, Dayna was not prepared for a life that revolved around frequent illnesses and near-constant medical appointments. Once her children started on a plasma-based immunoglobulin therapy regimen, she found renewed hope for her family’s future.“Plasma-based therapies allow my children to live relatively normal lives, from traveling (pre-pandemic) to going to college — something I never thought would be a reality for them,” said Dayna. “Our kids are no longer defined by their disease; for that we are beyond grateful for every single plasma donor.”Many may be surprised to learn that plasma — the clear, straw-colored liquid portion of your blood — is a lifeline for thousands of people with rare, chronic and complex diseases. Because plasma cannot be produced in a lab, those who rely on continuous therapies developed from plasma are dependent on other people regularly donating plasma. Recently, the need for plasma donations has become more well-known. The plasma from individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 and now have antibodies to the virus is being used in the development of a potential treatment for COVID-19.It takes over 500 plasma donations to make a year’s supply of medicine for Dayna’s children, as this resource provides the steady infusion of missing antibodies they need. Dayna’s family is incredibly grateful for the dedication of plasma donors everywhere and they make it a point to visit donation centers regularly to share their gratitude. Unfortunately, they can’t do that this year, in person at least.Dayna has a message for those who are considering donating their plasma. “The holidays bring people and communities together to enjoy time with family and friends, and I encourage everyone to think of others during these unprecedented times and consider donating plasma. Your kind and generous donation can help change lives, including my kids'.”How you can helpIn the spirit of giving, BioLife Plasma Services will make a donation to Feeding America in honor of people who donate plasma during this holiday season. BioLife is grateful to all individuals who choose to give their time to donate plasma and help provide a healthier holiday season to those who are living with a rare disease.The need for plasma never goes away for those living with rare and chronic conditions. Plasma gives people living with immune deficiencies the chance to be like everyone else and celebrate the little moments that make the holidays magical. During a single morning or afternoon visit, you can get screened and easily donate plasma to help those in your community.BioLife Plasma Services has more than 130 state-of-the-art plasma donation centers across the United States. To learn more about BioLife, the donation process and how to schedule an appointment, visit www.biolifeplasma.com.BioLife Plasma Services is part of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited."

Once her children started on a plasma-based immunoglobulin therapy regimen, she found renewed hope for her family’s future.</p><p>“Plasma-based therapies allow my children to live relatively normal lives, from traveling (pre-pandemic) to going to college — something I never thought would be a reality for them,” said Dayna. “Our kids are no longer defined by their disease; for that we are beyond grateful for every single plasma donor.”</p><p>Many may be surprised to learn that plasma — the clear, straw-colored liquid portion of your blood — is a lifeline for thousands of people with rare, chronic and complex diseases. Because plasma cannot be produced in a lab, those who rely on continuous therapies developed from plasma are dependent on other people regularly donating plasma. Recently, the need for plasma donations has become more well-known. The plasma from individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 and now have antibodies to the virus is being used in the development of a potential treatment for COVID-19.</p><p>It takes over 500 plasma donations to make a year’s supply of medicine for Dayna’s children, as this resource provides the steady infusion of missing antibodies they need. Dayna’s family is incredibly grateful for the dedication of plasma donors everywhere and they make it a point to visit donation centers regularly to share their gratitude. Unfortunately, they can’t do that this year, in person at least.</p><p>Dayna has a message for those who are considering donating their plasma. “The holidays bring people and communities together to enjoy time with family and friends, and I encourage everyone to think of others during these unprecedented times and consider donating plasma. Your kind and generous donation can help change lives, including my kids'.”</p><p><strong>How you can help</strong></p><p>In the spirit of giving, BioLife Plasma Services will make a donation to Feeding America in honor of people who donate plasma during this holiday season. BioLife is grateful to all individuals who choose to give their time to donate plasma and help provide a healthier holiday season to those who are living with a rare disease.</p><p>The need for plasma never goes away for those living with rare and chronic conditions. Plasma gives people living with immune deficiencies the chance to be like everyone else and celebrate the little moments that make the holidays magical. During a single morning or afternoon visit, you can get screened and easily donate plasma to help those in your community.</p><p>BioLife Plasma Services has more than 130 state-of-the-art plasma donation centers across the United States. To learn more about BioLife, the donation process and how to schedule an appointment, visit <a href=\"http://www.biolifeplasma.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.biolifeplasma.com</a>.</p><p>BioLife Plasma Services is part of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.</p>",

            "body": "Plummeting temperatures and whipping winds are here for much of the country, and no matter where you live, cooler and drier winter air can really wreak havoc on your skin. When humidity is lower and indoor heat is on full blast, your skin gets stripped of the moisture it needs, causing dryness and dullness.All these factors can exacerbate the visible signs of aging, from loss of elasticity to lines and wrinkles. There are natural oils already in healthy skin that help create a protective barrier, but this time of year, extra TLC is essential to combatting both aging and the changing elements — and you don’t need to spend a fortune to make that happen!Your lightweight moisturizers and oil-free cleansers work well in summer, but winter months call for a refresh if you want to maintain a glowing, youthful complexion. Whatever elements you’re facing, now is a good time to re-examine your skincare shelf and update daily habits. You can swap in cost-effective solutions that offer the luxurious experience and efficacy you and your skin crave, for less.Check out these tips to keep your skin healthy and glowing on a budget all winter long, including suggestions from board-certified dermatologist Dr. Sabrina Fabi.1. Find a glow serum at the drugstoreSometimes a moisturizer is just not enough. 'When your complexion is dulling, adding a lightweight serum with vitamin C to your routine can give skin the boost it needs to rebuild glow and instantly look more luminous,” says Fabi.RoC Multi Correxion Revive + Glow Daily Serum is a new option that helps with radiance and firmness, with the bonus benefit of reducing fine lines and wrinkles.'What I like about this serum is the potency of the vitamin C. It has a 10% Active Vitamin C + Peptide blend and it works fast, delivering both instant results and longer-term benefits after four weeks of using it,' Fabi adds. 'You can easily find it at Target.com for under $25, and I think the results rival if not exceed some of the other expensive vitamin C options out there.'2. Hydrate from withinIt’s not just about products you put on your skin. Dewy skin starts from within — after all, your skin contains 64% water. Drinking plenty of water helps minimize dry skin that becomes more noticeable when it gets cold outside.As a rule of thumb, you should drink at least half your body weight in ounces of water every day. To make your fluid intake more enjoyable, try adding sliced fruit to your iced water, or having a mug of hot tea when you’re feeling chilled.3. Cleanse, don't stripAfter a cold or long day, you might be tempted to hop into a long, hot shower. It’ll warm you up, but it won’t do your skin any favors. “Hot water breaks down barriers in your skin and takes away moisture,” says Fabi.Aim to get in and out of the shower as fast as you can, using lukewarm water. Skip the soap or try a gentle cleanser. As soon as you’re done, pat dry and apply a moisturizing cream immediately to prevent your skin from itching and flaking. If you're still feeling dry, consider investing in a humidifier to add moisture to your home's air.4. Moisturize and protectMoisturizing your skin starts with finding the right product. Swap your summer formula for a thicker, more hydrating consistency. There’s no need to spend money on several expensive products. Look for an all-in-one formula with ingredients like hyaluronic acid to draw water into the skin, and glycerin or dimethicone to help retain moisture and protect it from the elements.5. Gently exfoliateIn between all that moisturizing, gentle exfoliation is also crucial to getting your glow. Buff away flaky dead skin cells so new ones have a chance to shine. Chemical exfoliators with alpha hydroxy acids also help improve the effectiveness of your moisturizer. When those dead skin cells aren’t in the way, your skin will absorb and retain more moisture.Winter is here, but your skin doesn’t have to pay the price. Follow these tips to stay within your budget and achieve the glowing, more youthful look you desire."

Many people are forced to choose between paying bills, their medications, and putting food on the table. It's no wonder Gallup polls consistently find healthcare costs to be one of this country's greatest worries.But there are ways to cut those high out-of-pocket costs. The Patient Access Network (PAN) Foundation, a national charity that provides financial assistance to help people pay for their prescription medications, offers these tips for reducing your out-of-pocket costs for the lifesaving medications you need.Talk to your healthcare team. Be honest with your doctor and pharmacist about the challenge of affording your medications. It may be difficult for you to talk about your finances, but remember, your healthcare team is on your side. Let them know what you can afford and they may be able to tailor a treatment plan that fits within your budget.Look into ‘Extra Help.’ Medicare beneficiaries may qualify for programs like, Extra Help, also known as the Low-Income Subsidy program. This program can significantly reduce your prescription costs.Ask for generics. Many name-brand drugs now have generic equivalents, especially if the drugs you're taking have been on the market for a while. Generics are significantly cheaper than their name-brand versions. And don't worry. Generics are run through the same safety and efficacy tests by the FDA to ensure their quality and effectiveness.Sign up for FundFinder. FundFinder is a free web-based app developed by the PAN Foundation that connects you with a charitable patient assistance foundation that could help pay the out-of-pocket costs for your prescription medications. Rather than having to monitor multiple foundations to see if they’re offering funding, FundFinder checks for you and alerts you through email or text when the financial help that you need is available at PAN or another charitable foundation.Shop around. You'd be surprised how much drug costs can vary from pharmacy to pharmacy. Make a few calls to make sure you're not paying more than you have to for the medications you need. And ask about discounts and coupons, like the NeedyMeds discount card, which could help you save up to 80% off prescription drug prices.Check your state's assistance programs. Many states have assistance programs for residents who are having trouble paying for their medications. The first place to start is with your state's department of health. They can tell you about the programs that are available and whether you qualify. They also may have information about other programs in your area that are designed to help people afford their medication.Looking ahead to the new year should be full of hope, not worries about affording prescription medications.

            "body": "This year, more Americans are providing ongoing caregiving, with many having started their role as caregiver since the COVID-19 outbreak or providing care specifically because of the pandemic. Caregivers are looking to strike that balance between ensuring their elderly friends and family are safe and healthy while letting them maintain their independence. Yet, the need to limit contact by social distancing or self-quarantining has disrupted the ability to provide the hands-on care our loved ones deserve.For that reason, families are looking for ways to help make remote caregiving easier. There’s now an option for both the family member providing support and their loved one leveraging the simplicity of Alexa.The Care Hub helps families stay connected, no matter if they’re 3 or 3,000 miles apart. And, it’s available on Alexa-enabled devices that many customers already have, like Echo Dot and Echo Show. Once set up and approved by both the family member and loved one, they both simply go about their day as normal. The family member can get alerts and use the Alexa app to see their loved one’s recent activity at a high-level, so the aging loved one still has privacy while the person providing support has the information they need in order to know their loved one is OK. And their loved one has the added comfort of knowing they can ask for help at any time by just asking Alexa.Care Hub offers a simple, unobtrusive way to care for loved ones remotely and stay connected at a time when many of us are not able to be with the ones we love. Here’s a quick look at how the Care Hub works.It alerts you when something’s amiss: As the person providing support, you can set up alerts to get notifications when your loved one has their first interaction of the day with Alexa, or if no activity is detected by a designated time, such as 10 a.m.Non-intrusive visibility on your loved one’s day: The goal of creating Care Hub was to give people only a high-level view of their loved one’s activities. When you look through the activity feed of the Care Hub, it shares only the basics. If your loved one streams a movie, asks for information or listens to music, you can see they were using Alexa for Entertainment or Information, but it won't reveal the details like what your loved one asked Alexa. And, the loved one can always view this same information from the Care Hub in their Alexa app, too.Convenient connection: When both parties have an Alexa-enabled device and grant permission to connect via the Care Hub, staying in touch is easy. With the Care Hub, you can initiate a hands-free call over morning coffee or use the Drop In feature as a two-way intercom for a quick check in. Daily contact is effortless.Help is just a call away: Care Hub makes it easy to access help when your loved one needs it. As part of the Care Hub set up process, they can enable Alexa Communications and select you as their emergency contact. If your loved one selected you as their emergency contact, when they simply say, “Alexa, call for help,” you’ll get a call on your Alexa-enabled device, and you’ll also get a text and push notification sent to your phone. So even if you’re out and about, you’ll know your loved one has reached out.Care Hub is free of charge and is available with the Alexa app. To learn more, visit amazon.com/carehub."

            "html": "<p>This year, more Americans are providing ongoing caregiving, with many having started their role as caregiver since the COVID-19 outbreak or providing care specifically because of the pandemic. Caregivers are looking to strike that balance between ensuring their elderly friends and family are safe and healthy while letting them maintain their independence. Yet, the need to limit contact by social distancing or self-quarantining has disrupted the ability to provide the hands-on care our loved ones deserve.</p><p>For that reason, families are looking for ways to help make remote caregiving easier. There’s now an option for both the family member providing support and their loved one leveraging the simplicity of Alexa.</p><p>The Care Hub helps families stay connected, no matter if they’re 3 or 3,000 miles apart. And, it’s available on Alexa-enabled devices that many customers already have, like Echo Dot and Echo Show. Once set up and approved by both the family member and loved one, they both simply go about their day as normal. The family member can get alerts and use the Alexa app to see their loved one’s recent activity at a high-level, so the aging loved one still has privacy while the person providing support has the information they need in order to know their loved one is OK. And their loved one has the added comfort of knowing they can ask for help at any time by just asking Alexa.</p><p>Care Hub offers a simple, unobtrusive way to care for loved ones remotely and stay connected at a time when many of us are not able to be with the ones we love. Here’s a quick look at how the Care Hub works.</p><p><strong>It alerts you when something’s amiss:</strong> As the person providing support, you can set up alerts to get notifications when your loved one has their first interaction of the day with Alexa, or if no activity is detected by a designated time, such as 10 a.m.</p><p><strong>Non-intrusive visibility on your loved one’s day:</strong> The goal of creating Care Hub was to give people only a high-level view of their loved one’s activities. When you look through the activity feed of the Care Hub, it shares only the basics. If your loved one streams a movie, asks for information or listens to music, you can see they were using Alexa for Entertainment or Information, but it won't reveal the details like what your loved one asked Alexa. And, the loved one can always view this same information from the Care Hub in their Alexa app, too.</p><p><strong>Convenient connection:</strong> When both parties have an Alexa-enabled device and grant permission to connect via the Care Hub, staying in touch is easy. With the Care Hub, you can initiate a hands-free call over morning coffee or use the Drop In feature as a two-way intercom for a quick check in. Daily contact is effortless.</p><p><strong>Help is just a call away:</strong> Care Hub makes it easy to access help when your loved one needs it. As part of the Care Hub set up process, they can enable Alexa Communications and select you as their emergency contact. If your loved one selected you as their emergency contact, when they simply say, “Alexa, call for help,” you’ll get a call on your Alexa-enabled device, and you’ll also get a text and push notification sent to your phone. So even if you’re out and about, you’ll know your loved one has reached out.</p><p>Care Hub is free of charge and is available with the Alexa app. To learn more, visit <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/carehub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">amazon.com/carehub</a>.</p>",

            "body": "The race to create and distribute effective COVID-19 vaccines continues. Big pharmaceutical companies are producing promising vaccines and initial distribution is underway, however, this is not without numerous concerns or logistical hurdles. What you don't hear much about is the smaller biotech companies working hard behind the scenes to develop alternative medicines that have big potential in fighting the novel coronavirus and much more.Concerns with current big pharma optionsThe COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly changing vaccine technology, with innovative approaches that are moving away from the use of live viruses towards genetic-based approaches using RNA and DNA vaccines.Rather than injecting a weakened form of a virus or bacteria into the body, like with the flu vaccine, DNA and RNA vaccines use part of the virus’ own genes to create antigens that stimulate an immune response. So, when someone who was treated with the vaccine gets exposed to the virus later on, their immune system will be able to fight it off more easily and reduce their risk for serious illness.While it's critical to produce a safe, effective COVID-19 vaccine, the leading candidates are RNA vaccines, which despite promising results, do have several drawbacks. RNA is very easily destroyed due to the body’s natural enzymes and chemical reactions which will break the RNA apart. As a result, these vaccines need to be manufactured, shipped and stored under very specific and extremely cold conditions in order to try to slow or prevent that breakdown of RNA.These stability and manufacturing issues can lead to limited production capabilities, leaving governments and communities fighting for available supplies. Distribution and storage is complex, with one option requiring more than -70 degrees Celsius refrigeration. Supply chain issues may be an ongoing issue.Small biotech with big ideas and the potential to save livesWhile leading pharmaceutical companies are spearheading the fight against COVID-19, it's important to consider the potential technologies that smaller organizations are researching. One of those companies is Orbis Health Solutions, a South Carolina-based biotech using its deep cancer research experience and established vaccine technology to create a new approach to fighting COVID-19 — a DNA vaccine that addresses the shortcomings of the current frontrunners and with the ability to combat future viruses and biological threats.Based on the research and science of Thomas E. Wagner, Ph.D., the company’s founder and chief scientific officer, the potential COVID-19 vaccine uses a blueprint based on Orbis’ success in treating cancer through personalized vaccines. In addition to positive data from its Phase IIb cancer clinical trial, proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated that Orbis’ vaccine technology platform has a wide range of possibility, from addressing agriculture and veterinary applications to fighting future pandemics and biological threats.“We have developed a very successful vaccine against cancer, which is the most difficult challenge for the immune system,' says Wagner. 'Now we’ve shifted our science and technology to fight the current COVID-19 pandemic and what we're seeing is incredibly hopeful.”The science for the new vaccine is based on cancer vaccine technology that delivers foreign substances (antigens) to help the immune system to recognize an invader and trigger an immune response. In cancer therapy, this is created with antigens from a patients' own tumor. For COVID-19, Orbis scientists have created a synthetic replica of portions of the DNA code of the virus focusing on the spike proteins, which is the external part of the virus that penetrates a healthy cell. The vaccine contains this information in order to trigger a response and help teach the immune system how to fight the foreign invader and eliminate the virus.Neutralizing antibodies in 100% of trial participantsThe good news: Early data shows promise. Results of a clinical trial evaluating 20 healthy volunteers demonstrated that one inoculation with the vaccine led to 100% of participants expressing neutralizing antibodies against the virus, meaning the vaccine is successful in triggering that critical immune response to COVID-19.The Orbis COVID-19 vaccine doesn't use any part of the virus itself, only the DNA encoding the spike protein. For this reason, it is believed to be a safe option with few side effects. What's more, there's no need for low-temperature storage and it's highly scalable, so it may be easier to quickly get enough vaccine worldwide, especially to those who need it most.“We are very encouraged by these Phase I data, which represent a critical milestone for our vaccine technology platform and echo the early success of our personalized cancer vaccine,” said George E. Peoples, M.D., chief medical officer of Orbis Health Solutions. “Following further data analysis and discussion with regulatory authorities, we remain committed to initiating a larger Phase II trial that will move us one step closer to bringing this important treatment to patients as soon as possible so that we can help address this global health emergency.”These trials are particularly important because if successful, they will provide definitive proof of concept for the platform that could be rapidly applied to future vaccines to help with new viruses and health concerns within a matter of weeks versus months to years. To learn more, visit http://orbishealthsolutions.com/.'Just as COVID-19 didn't exist a few years ago, other diseases and viruses will evolve,' Wagner says. 'The proprietary delivery platform for the Orbis vaccine provides a blueprint that can be updated quickly with different DNA information, which allows for rapid vaccine development and deployment to address the next viral or biological threat. This platform has the potential to save many lives both now and in the future.'"

            "body": "January is Glaucoma Awareness Month, a great opportunity to spread the word about a disease that affects more than 3 million people in the United States. Since glaucoma often strikes without symptoms and can cause significant vision loss before a person notices changes in their eyesight, it’s critical to learn what you can do to protect your eyes.Taking steps to protect your vision is more challenging this year because of the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our daily lives. January is also typically a time of flux in health insurance coverage with plan changes, deductible and co-pay resets, and prescription plan updates. However, despite these challenges, protecting your vision should remain a priority.Here are three things you can do to take control of your eye health this month.1. Schedule an annual eye examEarly detection and treatment are paramount to managing glaucoma and other vision-threatening conditions. That’s why it’s critical to have an annual eye exam, particularly if you’re over the age of 40. Since some forms of glaucoma are inherited, it’s also important to talk with family members to see if there is any history of the disease within your family. It may not be something your family members have talked about before! This will be valuable information to share with your eye doctor during your exam.“Glaucoma Awareness Month is a great time for a candid conversation about glaucoma within your family,” says Tom Brunner, president and CEO of the Glaucoma Research Foundation. “If you have a family history of glaucoma you may be at higher risk for developing the condition. The earlier glaucoma is detected, the more manageable the disease may be to treat.”2. Maintain your current eye care planWhile the pandemic has caused many people to consider delaying in-person medical appointments, it’s very important to keep scheduled office visits if you have been diagnosed with glaucoma. Your eye doctor needs to see you periodically to ensure that your vision is stable and adjust your treatment plan if needed.If you are concerned about the safety of in-person office visits, you may be pleasantly surprised by the comprehensive steps your eye care provider has taken to help keep you safe. When you make your appointment, the office staff will let you know about any new safety protocols and requirements.“Social distancing and other protective measures are changing the in-office patient experience,” says Dr. Richard Lewis, a practicing glaucoma specialist and chief medical officer at Aerie Pharmaceuticals. “Among the steps we have taken at my practice are plastic shielding on the instruments, requiring staff and patients to wear masks, and minimizing waiting room and exam room ‘chair’ time.”It’s also important to continue taking prescribed medications as part of your ongoing glaucoma care. One common reason why people stop taking their medications is because of the cost. The key is to understand your prescription benefits, particularly what medicines are covered, as well as when annual deductible resets and co-pay adjustments occur.When filling your prescriptions, it may also help to shop around. The price for a medication can vary from one pharmacy to the next, with preferred pharmacies associated with your health plan usually offering the more competitive price. If you are on a Medicare Part D drug plan that doesn’t cover your medication, your doctor may be able to submit a prior authorization to allow you to get it. In addition, if you have commercial insurance and are taking a brand medication, the pharmaceutical company may be able to assist you financially in the form of prescription savings programs.3. Understand your treatment optionsOngoing scientific research and clinical development in the field of glaucoma have brought forward an array of new medical interventions. In fact, today your eye doctor has more options to treat glaucoma and provide personalized care than ever before. Become your own advocate by learning about all the treatment options that are available and discussing your specific needs with your doctor.A valuable starting point is “Understanding and Living with Glaucoma,” a free booklet published by the Glaucoma Research Foundation. It can be downloaded or ordered at www.glaucoma.org/booklet. The foundation’s website also offers a wealth of resources to help you take control of your eye health during Glaucoma Awareness Month and beyond."

What some might be noticing is that those snuggles from a cute pup or kitty come at a cost — itchy allergy eyes. If you are experiencing irritated, itchy eyes since bringing home your furry friend, you might be allergic to pet dander and animal hair. Before you make plans to send your new best friend back to the shelter, there might be help.Dog owner and New York University Langone Health allergist-immunologist Dr. Tania Elliott understands these unpleasant allergy symptoms all too well and has some ideas on how to keep your allergies under control when you are sharing your home with a pet.“Eye allergies can either be seasonal or perennial and can be triggered by indoor or outdoor allergens. If you tend to get itchy eyes around the same time every year, you may be suffering from seasonal allergies,” says Elliott. “Seasonal allergies are most common in the spring, summer and fall when the pollen count is higher and people tend to spend more time outdoors. Unlike seasonal allergies, perennial or year-round allergies may occur at any time of the year or last all year long.”See a doctor to confirm if your pet is causing your symptomsAlthough you may think that your new pet is the culprit for your eye allergies, your long outdoor walks with your furry friend could also be exposing you to outdoor allergens, such as pollen or ragweed.“As soon as you bring a new pet home, it’s important to monitor your symptoms and write everything down,” says Elliott. “Once you’ve monitored your symptoms, you can make small changes to see if that helps with your itchy eyes. If your symptoms do not subside, then you should visit your allergist or eye doctor to determine the cause.”Give your pet regular bathsPet dander is made up of tiny flecks of skin shed by animals with fur or feathers. These particles are so small that they can end up airborne and may cause itchy, red eyes. To minimize the spread of pet dander, it is important to bathe your pet once to twice a month, if not more. “As a dog owner myself, I make sure that my dog is bathed at least twice a month to help minimize allergic triggers in my home,” says Elliott.Look for over-the-counter options that help you find reliefAvoiding exposure to the allergen that triggers you can keep eye allergies at bay, but Dr. Elliott knows that is not always possible. Luckily, for both indoor and outdoor allergy sufferers, finding relief from itchy allergy eyes can be as simple as heading online or to the store shelf. Pataday® Once Daily Relief and Pataday® Twice Daily Relief feature the ingredient doctors prescribed most for eye allergy itch relief without the need for a doctor’s visit or prescription.The takeawayIf you think your new pet is the cause of your itchy allergy eyes, try these tips to get relief. If your symptoms do not improve after making these small changes or trying Pataday®, then visit your doctor to determine the source of your symptoms."

            "body": "After months of cautionary travel and shelving vacation plans, people, especially those with families at home, are researching how they can indulge their wanderlust safely again in 2021. The goal is to enjoy a vacation in a responsible manner, creating memories while keeping yourself and others safe.Heading to Coastal Mississippi: The Secret Coast is a good option as its location in the Southern United States brings warm weather throughout the year, plus access to the Gulf and plentiful opportunity to explore outdoors. Travel interest is up for The Secret Coast as its 62 miles of scenic shoreline dotted by unique coastal communities boast Southern charm and hospitality. Many people are choosing to discover this destination based on the Coastal Mississippi Promise of Health and Safety, which pledges that visitors can expect all hospitality partners to follow recommendations from leading health agencies and regional health care authorities to ensure everyone's safety.“Travel will likely still look different in 2021. While we welcome visitors to explore Coastal Mississippi and safely create lasting memories, we encourage travelers to make informed decisions when planning their vacations,” says Milton Segarra, CEO of Coastal Mississippi.In addition to visiting a destination that prioritizes public health, it's wise to take additional steps to keep your travel group and others safe. To help you do that, here are some of the most effective ways to vacation responsibly in 2021:Mask up Everyone 2 years and older should wear masks while in public, per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation. This includes when you're on vacation, so pack extra masks and plan on wearing them indoors — such as at shops or attractions — as well as outdoors if you're within 6 feet of another person not in your household. You might even consider ordering special masks that commemorate your group trip rather than the traditional T-shirt. They make for great vacation photographs!Know and follow local restrictionsAlthough the federal government has provided best overall practices for staying safe during the pandemic, specific regulations may vary depending on where you travel. Take the time to research your destination and what specific protocols they may require. Then talk with your travel group ahead of time so you can all be proactive in following these rules and keeping everyone safe.Sanitize frequentlyKeep hands clean by washing regularly and avoid touching your face. Wash with soap and water for 20 seconds, or about the length of time to sing 'Happy Birthday' twice. When soap and water aren't available, hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol is a good option. In addition to hands, consider sanitizing surfaces before use, such as the tray table if flying on your vacation. It may have been sanitized already, but this gives you peace of mind and limits germ-spread even more.Enjoy outdoor spacesWhen planning your itinerary, consider ideas that are outdoors. Fresh air and space to social distance is safer and can make your vacation more enjoyable. From beautiful bayous and bays to the longest man-made beach in the nation, Coastal Mississippi offers an array of outdoor adventures, including exploring the Gulf Islands National Seashore at Davis Bayou, water paddling along scenic blueways, fishing trips, sunset boat excursions and much more.Explore accommodationsYou want to be comfortable where you stay and confident it's clean, so spend some time researching what different accommodations are doing to keep guests safe. Then, book what feels right for you, whether that be a sprawling resort, private bed and breakfast, or unique boutique hotel. Featuring four modern, floating cabins complete with wet bars, and private, lush outdoor showers, Hotel Beatnik in Mississippi's Ocean Springs Creative District offers a fun new option for travelers.Book tickets early for attractions Many attractions are altering procedures and rules to keep wellness top of mind. Call and ask about what they're doing to keep everyone safe and if there are new occupancy limits. You may want to book tickets early because fewer are being sold so less people are in a particular attraction at once. The newly opened Mississippi Aquarium in Coastal Mississippi is adhering to all recommended guidelines and provides an opportunity for visitors to explore more than 80,000 square feet of exhibits connected by landscaped walkways with plantings representing all seven Physiographic Regions of Mississippi.Stay home if you feel sick Finally, if you feel sick, stay home. Many accommodations and attractions will refund your money or offer vouchers for use in the future. That way you can go when you're feeling well and can fully enjoy your trip while also helping to limit the spread of illness."

            "body": "Uncertainty continues into the holiday season, with limited travel, canceled events and strict budgets changing how Americans will celebrate this year.According to a recent Coinstar Holiday Survey, the majority of Americans said COVID-19 will influence how they celebrate the holidays.Fortunately, by thinking outside the box and keeping a positive attitude, you can stay healthy, stretch funds and create merry moments. Let these tips inspire you to celebrate the holiday season safely and on budget:1) Maintain traditions in new, safe waysTraditions bring comfort and hope, so rather than forgoing beloved activities due to coronavirus concerns, get creative. Plan a car caravan to look at holiday lights and have everyone keep a scorecard of favorite houses including winners for most creative, brightest, funniest and overall best. Set up a video chat and bake favorite holiday treats in real time from afar. Relatives can virtually tuck kids into bed by reading classic holiday books through a free digital video platform. These activities are safer to enjoy and will create meaningful memories to make the season special.2) Make gifts to save moneyYou can still have a wonderful holiday even on a tight budget. A budget-friendly option is to make it a homemade holiday this year. Face masks and hand sanitizer are great stocking stuffers that you can make and will be appreciated, especially this year. Patterns are readily available to make face masks and you can find recipes online for creating custom hand sanitizer. Another idea is to choose all handmade gifts from Etsy or local artists in your area, so you can give unique presents while supporting small businesses.3) Cash in spare changeEven with fewer in-person gatherings and reduced gift giving this season, most people have increased expenses during the holiday season. Cashing in spare change is a good way to stretch your budget. Research shows Americans with spare change at home estimate that they have on average $113 in and around their homes. These funds can be used to buy gifts or apply to other holiday expenses. Coinstar kiosks found at most grocery stores are an easy way to convert loose change for cash, a no-fee eGift card or tax-deductible charity donation.4) Plan a virtual gift exchangeAccording to the Coinstar Holiday Survey, two in five Americans who say their holiday will be different due to COVID-19 say they do not plan to travel or attend in-person gatherings. To enjoy the holidays safely, consider a virtual gift exchange with friends or family. Drop off or mail gifts and plan a time for everyone to video chat and open presents together. Get dressed in your favorite holiday attire to make the event feel special, whether that's festive formal wear or ugly sweaters and sweats. Then, take turns opening gifts and feel the joy.5) Give gifts with meaningRather than a traditional present, consider alternative gifts that show you care. Do you have a talent that would benefit others, such as tutoring a friend’s child who is studying remotely? Could you drop off a meal for a senior who’s homebound? Could you donate a snack basket for hard-working delivery personnel? Lastly, instead of a present, you could make a donation in the recipient's name to a charity close to that person's heart.6) Delay holiday celebrationsAll of these ideas can help you maximize the holiday season, but if you still long to celebrate in person, consider planning a gathering for later in 2021. According to the survey, about half said they would consider “Christmas in July” in 2021 for in-person celebrations. So, whether it’s a summer Christmas event or another holiday, it’s something to look forward to once it’s safe again. Send out 'save the date' invitations and put your creative juices to work for a summer get-together."

            "body": "This holiday season may look very different from years past — more family get-togethers on video rather than in-person — but one thing remains true: these times can be stressful and difficult for those managing hearing loss, which impacts 48 million Americans, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Hearing loss has been shown to affect nearly every dimension of human life, including physical, emotional and mental health. During the holidays, it can be even more overwhelming for those living with hearing loss, since many have a difficult time following conversations or fully participating in family traditions, and studies have shown this can lead to feeling more isolated and excluded from family festivities.These experiences are all too familiar for Eric Jackson, the renowned former U.S. World Champion and Olympic Kayaker, who has lived with hearing loss most of his life after a bout with scarlet fever as a child.“During special occasions when you are with people you haven’t seen in a while, you can’t be fully engaged with them, and unlike the people around you, you are not able to catch up the same way, which ends up feeling like you are missing out on the fun,” said Jackson.Now at age 54, his hearing has been partially restored over time, but he continues to rely on his ReSound ONE hearing aids and lip reading to help him communicate. “When you have hearing loss, you don’t realize how smart, witty and funny family and friends can be, and having fully functional hearing aids changes that dramatically,” said Jackson.According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), nearly 30 million Americans could benefit from using hearing aids. “Since I first began using hearing aids, I am amazed at the advancements in hearing technology, but it all starts with taking a hearing test to understand the best approach for you,” said Jackson, who is now partnering with ReSound to encourage others to manage their hearing loss.As people spend time with family and friends this year either in person or via virtual gathering methods, below are some tips Eric has shared from his own experiences to help improve communication:If you believe you may be experiencing hearing loss or if a loved one is showing signs of hearing loss, visit ReSound.com to take a free online hearing test and start the new year by taking action about your hearing."

            "body": "More people than ever before are considering room air filters and purifiers to protect themselves against COVID-19 indoors. But do these devices really make a difference?Air purifiers and filters can help reduce airborne contaminants, including viruses, in a home, office or other confined space. While an air purifier by itself is not enough to protect people from COVID-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), when used along with the other best practices it recommends, operating an air purifier can be part of a plan to protect you and your family.It’s easy to see how breathing cleaner air could improve overall health and well-being — and some independent studies do show a benefit from air filters and purifiers. In fact, some of the technologies now used in these devices have been scientifically proven to remove or destroy harmful pathogens in the air.Types of Air CleanersBefore you buy, learn about the three primary types of air cleaning technologies.* HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filters use a woven filtration material to trap particles like smoke, dust and pathogens. Certified HEPA filters can collect 99.97% of particles of a certain size (0.3 microns in diameter or larger), which includes many viruses. Filters need to be changed on a regular basis and can be costly, so check the cost before you buy. While HEPA filters capture the most contaminants, they can also impede the volume of air that circulates.* Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, (UVGI) also referred to as UV-C, uses a specific type of ultraviolet light that deactivates pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. It’s a technology that’s been tested and used in hospitals and healthcare settings for years. A UV-C purifier doesn’t just trap smoke and dust like a HEPA filter: instead it inactivates viruses and other pathogens, rendering them harmless. While direct exposure to UV-C light can be harmful, it is safe when the UV-C bulb is completely concealed inside the unit, shielded from sight.For the most effective results, it’s important that the UV-C light is strong enough and the air exposure time is long enough. One UV-C purifier, the Airetrex 365, uses a 5-watt UV-C bulb for powerful exposure, with an air replacement rate of up to four times per hour in a 10’ by 10’ room. With average use, the bulb lasts up to two years. More details about UV-C technology from independent experts can be found at airetrex365.com, under “Why UV-C.”* Ionization uses electricity to change airborne particles from a positive to a negative state, weighing them down and causing them to drop from the air – effectively deactivating the virus particles. However, in the process, a potentially harmful byproduct called ozone is created. Anyone considering this technology should check the Ozone Parts Per Million rating (PPM) to ensure it is below the Food and Drug Administration’s limit of .005 PPM.Can you combine technologies?What about filters and purifiers that combine multiple technologies, like HEPA, UV-C and ionization – would that produce even cleaner air? The findings here are still unclear, and more is not always better.It’s best to focus on the features and benefits most important to you – and how well different filtration components can meet those needs in your selected space. For example, if you only want to trap most large airborne particles and allergens, a HEPA filter might be sufficient. On the other hand, if you’re concerned about viruses, like the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, you might consider the more advanced features of an air purifier with a UV-C light.Other considerationsYou should also consider room size before deciding on which air cleaner to purchase. Most manufacturers specify maximum square footage for different models, according to their capacity to filter the air in a room of a particular size in an hour. For homes, most heating and air conditioning experts recommend that the air in a room be replaced or exchanged close to three times every hour at a minimum.Air purifiers work much better in a closed or sealed room versus a big open space. Most homes rely on natural ventilation from doors, windows and air leaks for fresh air, unless the home has an air exchanger. Air purifiers can be particularly effective in homes and where there is limited ability to add fresh air.What filter works best? The answer depends on your needs. But the good news is that we can all breathe a little easier with today’s advances in home air-cleaning technology.People with a condition like asthma will benefit most from HEPA air filters, since they remove irritants like smoke, dust and dander. All these elements can impact health. If you’re looking for a purifier to potentially reduce exposure to pathogens and viruses, an air purifier with UV-C technology will likely process and sanitize more air in less time."

            "body": "While consumers have been in their homes more in 2020 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, USAA wants consumers to be aware of the potential increase in thefts during the holiday season.Top 10 states for USAA personal property theft claims in 20201. California2. Texas3. Washington4. Colorado5. Georgia6. Virginia7. North Carolina8. Oregon9. Florida10. ArizonaEven though you may be home more now than ever, don’t let your guard down. In fact, unlocked doors and windows can be the cause of successful burglaries, but they can be easily preventable. Home security is vital to the safety of yourself, your family and your belongings.Here are five simple ideas to help prevent home break-ins.Install a home security system: Security systems offer perhaps the most powerful protection for your home. Even a simple alarm system and a few well-placed signs in your yard and on your windows can greatly diminish the likelihood of home break-ins. If you can afford it, motion sensors on doors and windows, along with 24-hour monitoring, deliver even greater protection. Monitored security systems, such as ADT Home Security, may allow for discounts on your home or renters insurance.Don’t hide keys outside of your house: For convenience, many people hide a key outside near the front door. If a key is easy for your family or friends to find, it’s easy for a thief to find. Instead, leave a key with a neighbor you trust.Make it look like you’re home: Most thieves want to strike while you’re away. With some good sense and creativity, you can fool them into thinking you are home. Consider purchasing timers that turn your lamps and TV on and off at different times in the evening. You may also consider a timer for your front porch light. Also consider suspending your mail and newspaper delivery while you are away.Install outdoor lighting: Darkness is a burglar’s best friend.

In fact, unlocked doors and windows can be the cause of successful burglaries, but they can be easily preventable. Home security is vital to the safety of yourself, your family and your belongings.</p><p>Here are five simple ideas to help prevent home break-ins.</p><p><strong>Install a home security system: </strong>Security systems offer perhaps the most powerful protection for your home. Even a simple alarm system and a few well-placed signs in your yard and on your windows can greatly diminish the likelihood of home break-ins. If you can afford it, motion sensors on doors and windows, along with 24-hour monitoring, deliver even greater protection. Monitored security systems, such as <a href=\"https://www.usaa.com/inet/wc/adt-home-security\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ADT Home Security</a>, may allow for discounts on your home or renters insurance.</p><p><strong>Don’t hide keys outside of your house: </strong>For convenience, many people hide a key outside near the front door. If a key is easy for your family or friends to find, it’s easy for a thief to find. Instead, leave a key with a neighbor you trust.</p><p><strong>Make it look like you’re home: </strong>Most thieves want to strike while you’re away. With some good sense and creativity, you can fool them into thinking you are home. Consider purchasing timers that turn your lamps and TV on and off at different times in the evening. You may also consider a timer for your front porch light. Also consider suspending your mail and newspaper delivery while you are away.</p><p><strong>Install outdoor lighting: </strong>Darkness is a burglar’s best friend. When thieves approach your home, a bright light suddenly turning on may have them consider moving on. Motion activated lights are inexpensive, easy to install and a great way to put thieves in the spotlight.</p><p><strong>Keep windows and doors locked: </strong>This tip may seem obvious, but unlocked doors and windows are the cause of successful burglaries.

Pets and therapy animals have been shown to help alleviate stress, anxiety, depression, loneliness and social isolation. For example, a study by the Human Animal Bond Research Institute (HABRI) and Cohen Research Group found 74% of pet owners reported mental health improvements from pet ownership and 54% of pet owners reported physical health improvements from pet ownership.Pet ownership reduces U.S. health care costsAbout 80 million U.S. households have pets, according to the HABRI Foundation, and that pet ownership has saved the U.S. health care system an estimated $11.7 billion. The largest savings was determined based on a lower incidence of physician office visits by pet owners as compared to non-owners. Additional savings were calculated for increased physical activity for pet owners, such as dog owners who walk their dog five or more times a week.Pets provide security during times of stressA Purdue University study found animal-assisted therapies can help provide diversion from anxiety-inducing medical experiences, providing a sense of security, while also encouraging interaction and activity often critical for healing. Something as simple as an affectionate nuzzle or a wag of a tail from a therapy animal can decrease stress and anxiety for patients and the hospital staff. When at home, your own pet can provide a sense of security and peace to help manage stress and anxiety, too.Pets provide companionship, especially during times of isolationCompanionship is a top reason people own pets. During times of increased isolation such as quarantine and social distancing, this is particularly important. An additional study by HABRI found that pets are part of the solution to social isolation and loneliness, a growing public health epidemic, even before the COVID-19 pandemic. Around 85% of respondents agree that interaction with pets help reduce loneliness and 76% agree that human-pet interactions can help address social isolation, followed by 72% who believe that human-animal interaction is good for their community.Organizations are stepping up to support pet ownershipRealizing the many benefits of pet ownership, some organizations are doing their part to support the pet effect. For example, PetSmart Charities is providing grants supporting nearly 4,000 animal welfare organizations across the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico to provide shelter, socialization and veterinary care to homeless pets to prepare them for adoption, as well as providing resources to help keep pets and the people that love them together.Since 2012, PetSmart Charities have committed nearly $4 million in grants to support change making local animal welfare organizations across North America."

            "summary": "",
            "body": "If you or a family member have sought care from a mental health professional, or are considering seeking help for depression, anxiety, ADHD or other conditions, you want the best treatment available. Multiple treatment options now exist for many of these conditions, ranging from medications and psychotherapy to alternative treatments. It can be confusing to sort through your choices and determine what approach will give you or your loved one the ideal outcome.In recent years, the understanding of the role genetics plays in mental health has grown exponentially. With that understanding has come the ability for genetic testing to provide answers to questions patients and their healthcare providers have about personalized treatment options.An individual’s mental health and wellness is a function of genetics, lifestyle, environment, and experiences — this is called the Mental Health 360TM. Until now, we’ve been missing an important piece of the puzzle when it comes to mental health drug response: genetics. With this information, healthcare providers can obtain a more complete picture of their patient to identify a personalized treatment plan.A vital tool to help patientsJust as genetic testing has opened a window on greater understanding of our ancestry, physical health and predispositions to certain illnesses, today’s sophisticated genetics can help healthcare providers make more personalized medication choices.This breakthrough science, optimized for mental health by Genomind® over the last decade, is called pharmacogenetics. Pharma (medications) + genetics. This type of testing provides mental health practitioners with a clearer picture of an individual's response to medications such as understanding potential likelihood of efficacy or side effects and understanding how the body metabolizes medication to guide dosing decisions.Award-winning psychiatrist and author Dr. Bruce Kehr has been using genetic testing to evaluate patients in his practice at Potomac Psychiatry. “Using critical information from a patient’s genetic makeup, in combination with their current health condition and their health and family history, we have a much more complete picture, allowing us to personalize treatment options for each individual,” said Kehr, “And this can improve the odds of the best possible health outcome for each person.”How does pharmacogenetic testing work?Your genetic makeup, also known as your genotype, is your inherited DNA code, which serves as the building blocks of you. We get two copies of most genes — one copy is inherited from each parent.Our DNA is 99.9% the same from one person to another — and it’s that 0.1% difference or variation that makes us unique individuals. It’s this tiny but important piece of your unique genetic makeup where pharmacogenetic testing works to decode understanding of an individual’s response to medication.The Genomind® Professional PGx Express™ test collects a DNA sample from a painless cheek swab. Then certified lab technicians and state-of-the-art technology work together to test specific genes with these types of variations. It’s this information, coupled with a complete patient history, that healthcare providers use to personalize treatment.Jennifer C, mother of a Genomind patient shared, “I watched my daughter struggle for years and we had many moments of despair as she spiraled into the depths of anxiety and depression. We wondered if we’d ever find treatments for her that would work. Using Genomind’s test has been a lifesaving part of my daughter’s treatment.”Who is pharmacogenetic testing best suited for?Particularly for patients with depression or mood disorders that are resistant to pharmaceutical treatments, pharmacogenetics can help healthcare providers understand their response to different drugs. If a patient doesn’t respond as desired to a medication, or patients experience an adverse reaction, understanding their genetic make-up could guide smarter prescribing decisions.To help clinicians consider medication treatment, Genomind’s pharmacogenetic testing analyzes multiple well-characterized genes. Genomind Professional PGx Express is a comprehensive mental health PGx test assessing 24 genes, 130+ medications and 10+ conditions. This test focuses on two primary types of gene-drug interactions:Sarah B, a previous Genomind patient stated, “I have suffered from severe anxiety/depression for my entire life. It was annoying and difficult going through so many medications just to find one that 'might' work for me. My psychiatrist suggested getting this report to see what medicines would work well with my specific genes.

This process often led to patient frustration, along with added healthcare costs and potentially making their condition worse before finding the optimal treatment. In fact, 50% of depression patients do not respond to the first medication.[1]Using Genomind pharmacogenetics, healthcare providers can use the patient’s genetic information to narrow down which types of medications may be more effective, more tolerable and what starting doses may be best.Board-certified psychiatrist Dr. Scott Wiener uses Genomind testing to help make decisions about patient care. “Not everyone reacts to the same medication the same way. It’s important to know what the likely outcome may be for each patient before prescribing medications,” said Wiener. “Pharmacogenetics is a valuable tool to help make better informed decisions for patients.”Talk to your healthcare provider about using Genomind’s leading pharmacogenetic test to help personalize your treatment plan, available at Genomind.com.[1] Trivedi MH, Rush AJ, Wisniewski SR, et al.

            "html": "<p>If you or a family member have sought care from a mental health professional, or are considering seeking help for depression, anxiety, ADHD or other conditions, you want the best treatment available. Multiple treatment options now exist for many of these conditions, ranging from medications and psychotherapy to alternative treatments. It can be confusing to sort through your choices and determine what approach will give you or your loved one the ideal outcome.</p><p>In recent years, the understanding of the role genetics plays in mental health has grown exponentially. With that understanding has come the ability for genetic testing to provide answers to questions patients and their healthcare providers have about personalized treatment options.</p><p>An individual’s mental health and wellness is a function of genetics, lifestyle, environment, and experiences — this is called the Mental Health 360<sup>TM</sup>. Until now, we’ve been missing an important piece of the puzzle when it comes to mental health drug response: genetics. With this information, healthcare providers can obtain a more complete picture of their patient to identify a personalized treatment plan.</p><p><strong>A vital tool to help patients</strong></p><p>Just as genetic testing has opened a window on greater understanding of our ancestry, physical health and predispositions to certain illnesses, today’s sophisticated genetics can help healthcare providers make more personalized medication choices.</p><p>This breakthrough science, optimized for mental health by <a href=\"https://www.genomind.com/?utm_campaign=Public%20Relations&amp;utm_source=brandpoint&amp;utm_medium=mat-release&amp;utm_content=how-pgx-testing-is-revolutionizing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Genomind<sup>®</sup></a> over the last decade, is called pharmacogenetics. Pharma (medications) + genetics. This type of testing provides mental health practitioners with a clearer picture of an individual's response to medications such as understanding potential likelihood of efficacy or side effects and understanding how the body metabolizes medication to guide dosing decisions.</p><p>Award-winning psychiatrist and author Dr. Bruce Kehr has been using genetic testing to evaluate patients in his practice at Potomac Psychiatry. “Using critical information from a patient’s genetic makeup, in combination with their current health condition and their health and family history, we have a much more complete picture, allowing us to personalize treatment options for each individual,” said Kehr, “And this can improve the odds of the best possible health outcome for each person.”</p><p><strong>How does pharmacogenetic testing work?</strong></p><p>Your genetic makeup, also known as your genotype, is your inherited DNA code, which serves as the building blocks of you. We get two copies of most genes — one copy is inherited from each parent.</p><p>Our DNA is 99.9% the same from one person to another — and it’s that 0.1% difference or variation that makes us unique individuals. It’s this tiny but important piece of your unique genetic makeup where pharmacogenetic testing works to decode understanding of an individual’s response to medication.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.genomind.com/patients?utm_campaign=Public%20Relations&amp;utm_source=brandpoint&amp;utm_medium=mat-release&amp;utm_content=how-pgx-testing-is-revolutionizing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Genomind<sup>®</sup> Professional PGx Express™</a> test collects a DNA sample from a painless cheek swab. Then certified lab technicians and state-of-the-art technology work together to test specific genes with these types of variations. It’s this information, coupled with a complete patient history, that healthcare providers use to personalize treatment.</p><p>Jennifer C, mother of a Genomind patient shared, “I watched my daughter struggle for years and we had many moments of despair as she spiraled into the depths of anxiety and depression. We wondered if we’d ever find treatments for her that would work. Using Genomind’s test has been a lifesaving part of my daughter’s treatment.”</p><p><strong>Who is pharmacogenetic testing best suited for?</strong></p><p>Particularly for patients with depression or mood disorders that are resistant to pharmaceutical treatments, pharmacogenetics can help healthcare providers understand their response to different drugs. If a patient doesn’t respond as desired to a medication, or patients experience an adverse reaction, understanding their genetic make-up could guide smarter prescribing decisions.</p><p>To help clinicians consider medication treatment, Genomind’s pharmacogenetic testing analyzes multiple well-characterized genes. <a href=\"https://www.genomind.com/patients?utm_campaign=Public%20Relations&amp;utm_source=brandpoint&amp;utm_medium=mat-release&amp;utm_content=how-pgx-testing-is-revolutionizing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Genomind Professional PGx Express</a> is a comprehensive mental health PGx test assessing 24 genes, 130+ medications and 10+ conditions. This test focuses on two primary types of gene-drug interactions:</p><p>Sarah B, a previous Genomind patient stated, “I have suffered from severe anxiety/depression for my entire life. It was annoying and difficult going through so many medications just to find one that \"might\" work for me. My psychiatrist suggested getting this report to see what medicines would work well with my specific genes. I am 22 years old and the information I was given will be relevant to me for the rest of my life.”</p><p><strong>Designed to reduce the pain of treatment by trial and error</strong></p><p>Psychiatric medication is often prescribed on a trial-and-error basis, with practitioners monitoring each patient's response before adjusting medications or doses.

In 2021, everyone’s looking to grow their happiness and share it with others. It’s only natural, and fortunately research has given us some solid ideas of where to start.A 2008 study out of the Harvard Business School and the University of British Columbia has shown that the act of giving gifts makes people happy. Even happier than if we spent the money on ourselves. So, to make everyone more cheerful, here are some smile-inducing (and stress-reducing) gift ideas for 2021.Plants to calm and cheerIf you’ve never heard of the term ‘biophilia' that’s OK, most people haven’t. It’s a theory that says humans naturally seek out and benefit from connections to nature. Research has backed up this theory, particularly with the study of houseplants. Houseplants can do everything from bettering our concentration to improving our well-being. A 2019 Japanese study showed that people with a small plant on their desk showed lower anxiety and stress levels after four weeks.“Plants are the perfect gift to help us relax and be happy,” said Alfred Palomares, vice president of merchandising for leading gifting site 1-800-Flowers.com. “For folks looking for a way to connect in 2021, you can’t go wrong with the Prayer Plant, deemed our plant of the year. Its leaves fold together at night like praying hands, making it a wonderful reminder to be thankful and calm.”The Red Maranta Prayer Plant also makes a great gift because it’s easy to care for. When gifting houseplants, you’re hoping to give your loved one something that will last for months or years to come. Choosing a hardy species will help make that a reality, while a finicky plant might backfire and cause more stress for first-time “plant parents.”Flowers to energizeAnother gift scientifically proven to drive happiness, according to a Rutgers University study, is a lovely bouquet of cut flowers. What's more, flowers provide an instant burst of color. Bright colors have been shown to have their own positive psychological effects, from releasing “feel-good hormones” to increasing a person’s motivation.One especially positive color is yellow. It can have uplifting, illuminating and energizing effects. Perhaps that’s why a yellow hue was chosen as one of Pantone’s colors of the year for 2021, and why it is featured prominently in the 1-800-Flowers.com flower of the year: sunflowers.Gifting a sunflower bouquet is an easy way to spread happiness. Not only do they boast bright, cheerful colors, they’re also a large bloom that lasts more than a week after being cut.The shared joy of gift-givingAt the end of the day, there are a lot of ways to do gift-giving right. In 2021, look for presents that channel a strong sense of optimism and positivity. After all, those are feelings we all craved more of during 2020.Remember, whatever gifts you give, there’s happiness to be had all around. The joy of giving is equal to the joy of receiving, which makes gifting a sure-fire way to grow happiness in 2021."

We’re feeling that isolation even more acutely during the winter season, when we typically get together with those we love.For older adults who have had to take extra isolating precautions against exposure to COVID-19, these losses have been magnified, and in many cases, they’re layered on top of longstanding disconnections.With 36% of adults in America age 50 or older and 17% over 65, it’s reasonable to assume that social isolation is widespread. A recent survey of U.S. adults conducted by AARP Foundation and the United Health Foundation confirms it: The study found that two-thirds of respondents are experiencing social isolation, with nearly that number feeling more anxiety because of the pandemic. The consequences are disturbing.“Social isolation has reached epidemic proportions during the pandemic,” says AARP Foundation President Lisa Marsh Ryerson. “Decades of research on prolonged social isolation and loneliness show that it's worse for health than obesity, and as damaging to health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.'The survey also reveals that most isolated older adults are not asking others for assistance, perhaps because they don’t realize help is available.If you or a loved one are experiencing social isolation, whether it’s COVID-related or a daily reality that was already present, here are some important facts to know based on the AARP Foundation/United Health Foundation survey — followed by tips that can help increase social connection.Few have sought help about their feelings. Of those reporting social isolation during the pandemic, 50% say it has affected their motivation, 41% report greater anxiety and 37% have experienced feelings of depression.

Women 50 and older are more than twice as likely as men to feel overwhelmed as a result of the pandemic. Forty-six percent of women in that age bracket have felt anxious (compared to 36% of men), and 50% have felt stressed (compared to 40% of men). Twenty-nine percent of women 50 or older have gone for as long as three months without interacting with others outside their homes or workplaces.Low-income adults have seen greater impact. People 50 and older in income brackets of lower than $40,000 a year have been more affected by isolation than those with incomes of $75,000 or more.

Successfully taking on the COVID-19 virus by aiding vaccine development and management of clinical trials, researchers say, is only the beginning of what this powerful tool can achieve. Today, the pandemic; tomorrow, global warming and other looming humanitarian challenges of our time — alongside new, transformational ways of doing business, which will speed innovation, improve financial performance and boost job satisfaction for workers.AI is helping people answer what had been unanswerable questions, too complex for human brains and powerful computers to handle. One of the powerful lessons researchers say we are learning in the fight against COVID-19 is the power and value of data. Notably, the role data plays in predictive analytics generated through AI. For COVID-19, some healthcare professionals and researchers relied on genetic algorithms to evaluate, predict and model the virus’ behavior to help control its impact. That approach — using AI to see ahead — has enormous potential and is why predictive analytics is the subject of so much groundbreaking work in the field of AI.Researchers at digital technology innovator Cognizant are experts on next-generation AI and data science. Among their ongoing initiatives is development of a powerful tool, “Evolutionary AI,” which can literally help to see the future by quickly analyzing enormous amounts of data and mapping the anticipated trajectory of selected trends. Evolutionary AI goes a step further than analysis, answering immeasurably complex problems — then prescribing solutions. Think of the benefits for a research oncologist who can now evaluate patient diagnoses, test results, demographics and individual risk factors across a mind-boggling array of data points to prescribe the best treatment. Or a greenhouse farmer who can now analyze seeds, soil, temperature, humidity and light requirements to yield optimal growth. The ramifications of that kind of application could be enormous, leading to more efficient farming and more food. Not just prediction, which can be so valuable on its own, but prediction and prescription — a one-two, revolutionary technology punch.This new approach to issue-identification, prediction and decision-making is on full display during a new XPRIZE competition dubbed the Pandemic Response Challenge. A nearly three-month initiative co-sponsored by Cognizant, the challenge tasks participants to come up with the best way to use artificial intelligence to accurately predict COVID-19 infection rates and offer prescriptive intervention, all in an effort to save lives and re-open businesses, communities and the global economy. While there’s a $500,000 grand prize hanging in the balance for the top two winning teams, organizers say the real reward is in showcasing artificial intelligence capabilities and the power of machine learning. Simulations and models that are created during the challenge will not only have an enormous effect on the continuing battle against COVID-19, but they will also be potentially transformative in everyday business decision-making.But for now, this XPRIZE competition, the 23rd since the organization was founded in 1994, remains squarely focused on COVID-19. Organizers are hopeful the competition will shine a bright light on the monumental advancement of this technology and offer assessment paradigms, predictive platforms and a path forward for real-world applications to address the pandemic.“This challenge will inspire some of the world’s brightest innovators to address the immediate threats to our economies and livelihoods,” said Amir Banifatemi, chief innovation and growth officer at XPRIZE. He said the challenge could be a “game-changer when it comes to using data and artificial intelligence to create a route to recovery,” especially now that vaccines are becoming available.The ambitious, 10-week timeline of the competition underscores the urgency of stopping the spread of COVID-19 and developing a framework for communities and businesses to safely reopen. The challenge organizers are confident that artificial intelligence will help determine the best ways for communities to reopen, people to reengage with one another and the world to reclaim a sense of normal. In the case of COVID-19, AI could dramatically improve data-based decision-making and help shorten — even eliminate — another wave of infection, spread and death."

Think of the benefits for a research oncologist who can now evaluate patient diagnoses, test results, demographics and individual risk factors across a mind-boggling array of data points to prescribe the best treatment. Or a greenhouse farmer who can now analyze seeds, soil, temperature, humidity and light requirements to yield optimal growth. The ramifications of that kind of application could be enormous, leading to more efficient farming and more food. Not just prediction, which can be so valuable on its own, but prediction and prescription — a one-two, revolutionary technology punch.</p><p>This new approach to issue-identification, prediction and decision-making is on full display during a new XPRIZE competition dubbed the <a href=\"https://xprize.org/challenge/pandemicresponse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pandemic Response Challenge</a>. A nearly three-month initiative co-sponsored by Cognizant, the challenge tasks participants to come up with the best way to use artificial intelligence to accurately predict COVID-19 infection rates and offer prescriptive intervention, all in an effort to save lives and re-open businesses, communities and the global economy. While there’s a $500,000 grand prize hanging in the balance for the top two winning teams, organizers say the real reward is in showcasing artificial intelligence capabilities and the power of machine learning. Simulations and models that are created during the challenge will not only have an enormous effect on the continuing battle against COVID-19, but they will also be potentially transformative in everyday business decision-making.</p><p>But for now, this XPRIZE competition, the 23rd since the organization was founded in 1994, remains squarely focused on COVID-19. Organizers are hopeful the competition will shine a bright light on the monumental advancement of this technology and offer assessment paradigms, predictive platforms and a path forward for real-world applications to address the pandemic.</p><p>“This challenge will inspire some of the world’s brightest innovators to address the immediate threats to our economies and livelihoods,” said Amir Banifatemi, chief innovation and growth officer at XPRIZE. He said the challenge could be a “game-changer when it comes to using data and artificial intelligence to create a route to recovery,” especially now that vaccines are becoming available.</p><p>The ambitious, 10-week timeline of the competition underscores the urgency of stopping the spread of COVID-19 and developing a framework for communities and businesses to safely reopen. The challenge organizers are confident that artificial intelligence will help determine the best ways for communities to reopen, people to reengage with one another and the world to reclaim a sense of normal. In the case of COVID-19, AI could dramatically improve data-based decision-making and help shorten — even eliminate — another wave of infection, spread and death.</p>",

            "body": "Joel made his living driving a semi-truck cross country. He loved the scenic beauty and the feel of 18 wheels of rubber as he traveled across the United States. Unfortunately, after four life-threatening medical emergencies while he was on the road, Joel knew his career as a truck driver had to come to an end.In 2010, Joel had stopped in Little Rock, Arkansas, to get his truck repaired on his way to deliver cargo in Chicago. After spending the night in a local motel, he noticed purplish-colored spots on his face, back and side that looked like a bruise. He quickly wrote it off so he could complete the 650-mile trek to Chicago. He made the delivery feeling completely exhausted and with a migraine — the kind where he could see auras and lights in his peripheral field of vision.“I told myself, I need one good night of sleep and I would feel better the next morning. I went to bed early but kept having the urge to go to the bathroom. I couldn’t go. I knew based on a previous job working in a dialysis clinic that it wasn’t normal and thought I might have a urinary tract infection,” Joel explained.Joel was admitted to the hospital, but his team of healthcare providers did not have a diagnosis.“They called a hematologist. He ordered a blood sample and asked me about my symptoms. He recognized the symptoms as acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. I spent 15 days in the hospital, 1,000 miles from home with a condition I knew nothing about,” Joel recalled. “After the diagnosis, I held my head in my hands and sobbed my eyes out.”Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP) is a rare blood disorder that is a medical emergency and can be life-threatening. It occurs when there is a deficiency of an enzyme in the immune system (ADAMTS13) that causes blood clots to form in the small blood vessels, low platelet counts and destruction of red blood cells. For the estimated 2,000 people living with aTTP in the U.S., many experience a wide variety of symptoms, including fever, fatigue, headache, confusion and bruises or dots on the skin. aTTP can continue to impact people over the course of their life with recurrences.The longer haul About five years later, Joel experienced the fourth recurrence of aTTP and this time, he nearly died.“In the middle of the night, I still couldn’t sleep and walked down to the diner to order some breakfast. I opened my mouth, but nothing made sense,” Joel recollects. “The waitress gave me paper and a pen — I wrote 911.”Joel doesn’t remember arriving at the hospital and two days later, his family arrived to tell him he was in the intensive care unit on life support. He quickly realized he could no longer risk being so far from home if another occurrence were to happen. He walked away from the career he loved. Since then, Joel has had two more episodes.“Before each episode, I go through denial. I think there’s someone else that needs that hospital bed worse than me. I try to brush off the signs, but it’s so important to seek medical attention immediately. Don’t wait,” Joel notes. “aTTP is life-changing and you can’t ever fully recover or forget something like this, but a positive attitude and having a good sense of humor has been very helpful.”This article was written by and reprinted with permission from Sanofi Genzyme.

            "body": "The New Year always spurs a renewal of personal goals, whether you make resolutions or not. The blank slate of a new calendar year offers a sense of possibilities for making the next year great — and health goals usually top the list.If you’re looking to put health first, who better to turn to than a registered dietitian? Registered Dietitian Kelli McGrane, MS (@HealthyToast_RD), offers tips for boosting your health through a positive approach to food and exercise that supports your progress year-round.“When you’re figuring out what health or lifestyle changes you want to make, write out the pro’s and con’s of each change,” McGrane said. “Once you know why you’re choosing these goals, tape that list on your fridge or keep it on your phone for a boost of motivation anytime you need it.”Here are her top tips for improving your health.1. Be mindful of what you eatPeople are home more than ever and it’s easy to graze mindlessly through the kitchen. And as a result, the calories can add up quickly.A simple way to monitor your calories is the Lose It! app — an easy, helpful way to track what you’re eating and get inspired with healthy recipes. Since 2008, over 40 million Lose It! users have lost a collective 100 million pounds — that’s 350 billion calories lost.“The Lose It! app is a great way to help track calories and it also gives you information on the quality of your diet overall,” said McGrane. 'You can even use the app to track your water intake and activity throughout the day.'2. Prep your kitchen More time at home means more time near the kitchen. To avoid temptation, consider moving unhealthy snacks to the back of the refrigerator so you see the healthier choices first.Also, stock up on colorful vegetables and fruits, choose whole grains and keep lean proteins on hand for snacks. When temptation strikes, try a handful of nuts or a hard-boiled egg, as protein is more likely than highly-processed foods to boost your energy.3. Find a support systemWhether it’s a friend with similar health goals, a group you can Zoom with or the Lose It! community, a support system is invaluable when working toward lasting changes. Not only can they cheer you on, but they may even join your efforts to get and stay healthy.While everyone has limited their in-person interactions, there are also many digital resources to help you reach your goals.4. Figure out what moves youEveryone’s routines have been upended this year, and fitness is no exception. Now is the time to get creative and find an activity you love. Dancing to music, walking outdoors or using a stationary bike are all great ways to keep active.“Not only can getting in some form of physical activity help burn calories, but it can also boost your mood,” said McGrane. “Even housework can be a fun workout if you turn up your favorite music while you’re cleaning.”If you enjoy the outdoors during winter, try skating, skiing or snowshoeing. If you don’t like the cold, online exercise classes or active video games are great options for those without exercise equipment.5. Get enough restPeople often forget that sleep is a critical part of weight loss and health. In fact, a study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that when people were starved of sleep, late night snacking increased.“Being well-rested is important for having enough energy to exercise and make healthy food choices,” said McGrane. “And often people look to food for energy when what they really need is sleep.”If you aren’t getting 7-9 hours of sleep a night, notice what’s keeping you from going to bed. Can you turn off the gadgets an hour earlier? A quiet activity like reading or meditation can help you wind down and get to sleep easier.Staying healthy and fit in 2021 is as easy as following these simple tips. To further help you meet your health and weight loss goals, download the Lose It! app today."

            "body": "Experts in healthcare are continuously striving to develop new innovations that can improve and save lives. Even amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists, physicians, and researchers continued to advance medical knowledge, enhance screening and diagnostic tools, and improve disease management platforms, bringing new hope to patients in 2021.When it comes to medicine, there's a lot to be excited for in the new year. Here are the top innovations you should know about and the potential impact they may have on healthcare.Novel blood test detects over 50 types of cancersWhile current guideline-recommended cancer screenings in the U.S. are critical, they are limited, testing for just five cancers and screening for a single cancer at a time. The Galleri test from GRAIL strives to transform cancer care and save lives by detecting a multitude of cancers at once and at earlier stages, when treatment is more likely to be effective.In clinical validation studies, an earlier version of Galleri demonstrated the ability to detect more than 50 types of cancers — over 45 of which lack recommended screening today — with a very low false positive rate of less than 1%, all through a single blood draw. Galleri will be commercially available in 2021 and could have a tremendous human and economic impact.Learn more at grail.com/galleri.Life-changing vaccinations for COVID-19With pharmaceutical companies accelerating vaccine development timelines to curb the COVID-19 pandemic, and healthcare researchers around the world collaborating and exploring solutions, hope is on the horizon: long-awaited vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Now in the process of being distributed, the vaccine will first be available to vulnerable populations and frontline workers most at risk of the virus.Smart-device connected pacemakersPacemakers and defibrillators are implantable devices that regulate and correct heartbeats through electrical pulse. Remote monitoring of these devices is essential to ensure proper functioning, which in the past has occurred through bedside technology that communicates data to healthcare teams. This can be cumbersome, confusing, and time-consuming for patients.In 2021, patients will have new pacemaker options that work through wireless communication to a mobile app that provides data to their physicians. In addition to streamlining the data collection process, these apps are intended to engage the patient more deeply in their healthcare so they better understand their wellness journey.Telehealth and remote patient monitoringResource constraints and a global pandemic has positioned telehealth to be more widely adopted, with many experts predicting remote healthcare to become standard practice for a multitude of applicable purposes, including routine checkups and mental health appointments. Insurance policy changes are also supporting this option for connecting patients and their providers, even when physically distant.Although standard telehealth appointments might take place via secure video conference, the potential of virtual healthcare is even more dynamic. Remote patient monitoring uses special technology to connect healthcare teams to patients in their homes and can be used in chronic disease management, post-op recovery, and much more. Patients input vitals and other data and complex algorithms advise healthcare teams of trend departures so they can act quickly and effectively, helping improve health outcomes and reduce costs."

            "html": "<p>Experts in healthcare are continuously striving to develop new innovations that can improve and save lives. Even amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists, physicians, and researchers continued to advance medical knowledge, enhance screening and diagnostic tools, and improve disease management platforms, bringing new hope to patients in 2021.</p><p>When it comes to medicine, there's a lot to be excited for in the new year. Here are the top innovations you should know about and the potential impact they may have on healthcare.</p><p><strong>Novel blood test detects over 50 types of cancers</strong></p><p>While current guideline-recommended cancer screenings in the U.S. are critical, they are limited, testing for just five cancers and screening for a single cancer at a time. <a href=\"https://grail.com/galleri/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Galleri test</a> from GRAIL strives to transform cancer care and save lives by detecting a multitude of cancers at once and at earlier stages, when treatment is more likely to be effective.</p><p>In clinical validation studies, an earlier version of Galleri demonstrated the ability to detect more than 50 types of cancers — over 45 of which lack recommended screening today — with a very low false positive rate of less than 1%, all through a single blood draw. Galleri will be commercially available in 2021 and could have a tremendous human and economic impact.</p><p>Learn more at <a href=\"https://grail.com/galleri\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">grail.com/galleri</a>.<u></u></p><p><strong>Life-changing vaccinations for COVID-19</strong></p><p>With pharmaceutical companies accelerating vaccine development timelines to curb the COVID-19 pandemic, and healthcare researchers around the world collaborating and exploring solutions, hope is on the horizon: long-awaited vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Now in the process of being distributed, the vaccine will first be available to vulnerable populations and frontline workers most at risk of the virus.</p><p><strong>Smart-device connected pacemakers</strong></p><p>Pacemakers and defibrillators are implantable devices that regulate and correct heartbeats through electrical pulse. Remote monitoring of these devices is essential to ensure proper functioning, which in the past has occurred through bedside technology that communicates data to healthcare teams. This can be cumbersome, confusing, and time-consuming for patients.</p><p>In 2021, patients will have new pacemaker options that work through wireless communication to a mobile app that provides data to their physicians. In addition to streamlining the data collection process, these apps are intended to engage the patient more deeply in their healthcare so they better understand their wellness journey.</p><p><strong>Telehealth and remote patient monitoring</strong></p><p>Resource constraints and a global pandemic has positioned telehealth to be more widely adopted, with many experts predicting remote healthcare to become standard practice for a multitude of applicable purposes, including routine checkups and mental health appointments. Insurance policy changes are also supporting this option for connecting patients and their providers, even when physically distant.</p><p>Although standard telehealth appointments might take place via secure video conference, the potential of virtual healthcare is even more dynamic. Remote patient monitoring uses special technology to connect healthcare teams to patients in their homes and can be used in chronic disease management, post-op recovery, and much more. Patients input vitals and other data and complex algorithms advise healthcare teams of trend departures so they can act quickly and effectively, helping improve health outcomes and reduce costs.</p>",

The last thing you want is the coughs, the sneezes and a run-down, foggy head feeling to hang on for weeks on end.So, that begs the question: What can you do to get through this bug as quickly as possible?“Unfortunately, there is currently no cure for the common cold but there are some things you can do to line up your body’s natural defenses when you first start noticing symptoms,” says Dr. Jake Deutsch M.D., Founder and Clinical Director of Cure Urgent Care in New York City.What that means is taking action immediately. If you’re feeling sniffly or have a tickle in your throat, it’s time to put a quick plan into motion. Here’s the recipe for relief:1. Make a date with your pillow: Sleep lets your body rest and heal. Not getting seven to eight hours of shut-eye every night makes you more susceptible to catching a virus. Plus it can prolong your recovery time, according to the Mayo Clinic. When you feel a bug coming on, try an earlier bedtime to make sure you're getting the extra rest you need. And if you feel sleepy and run-down during the day, that’s your body telling you to take a break. Give yourself permission for a quick nap, if your schedule allows.2. Drink plenty of water: During a cold, your body will need more fluids; in fact, being sick puts you at risk of dehydration. To make sure you’re getting enough, download an app that lets you track how many ounces you’re drinking a day. Think about keeping your favorite teas on hand too, as the hot liquid loosens congestion.3. Get your dose of zinc: To shorten the duration of your cold, an effective product to try is Zicam® Cold Remedy RapidMelts®, available at Walmart. Its clinically proven homeopathic formula taps into the power of your body’s natural defenses to shorten colds. If you want to be better faster, take it at the first sign of a cold.BONUS TIP … Watch a funny movie: As you’ve probably heard, there’s a link between stress and depressed immune function. On the flip side, laughing triggers increased production of antibodies and T-cells that help fight off infection, according to research described in Science Daily. Streaming a comedy is the perfect pairing with a quiet, restful evening at home to get you on the road to recovery.“Although it may seem simple, completing these easy steps are the most important things you can do to support your immune system,” says Dr. Deutsch. “Aside from rest and relaxation, the single most proactive thing you can do is to take Zicam at that very first hint of a cold to get better faster.”To shorten your cold, adopt these healthy habits and turn to clinically proven Zicam® Cold Remedy.

That's because the older you are, the higher your risk of severe illness from the coronavirus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.While these important steps help keep seniors physically healthy, they can have a negative impact on mental well-being. Many elderly people already felt isolation before COVID-19 limitations. Now that many activities and interactions they previously enjoyed are no longer an option, this can be particularly disheartening.In fact, 76% of people 65 and older are anxious to spend time in-person with their loved ones, according to a COVID-19 impact study by Comfort Keepers, providers of senior in-home and respite care. What's more, 57% are eagerly awaiting the chance to embrace a loved one as soon as they can.'Seniors are struggling with the emotional impact of isolation now more than ever due to COVID-19,' says Carl McManus, CEO, Comfort Keepers North America. 'Fortunately, with a bit of creativity and outside-the-box thinking, friends and family can still bring joy to older loved ones to elevate the human spirit even from afar.'McManus and the experts at Comfort Keepers share their top tips to bring joy to seniors in a safe manner:Send joy in the mail: Many seniors still hold close the art of the handwritten letter, so try sitting down and writing out your thoughts to share with a loved one. An alternative would be a greeting card with a salutation and positive thoughts for the future. While sending mail for special occasions is always a welcome idea, consider sending letters periodically just to brighten the day.Share meaningful memories: Show seniors you're thinking about them by sending imagery of your times together over the past few years. This could be a photo either via text, email or mail. You can also have children paint or draw their favorite memories with senior loved ones. A picture is worth a thousand words and by sharing imagery of meaningful experiences you're showing that you cherish time together also. And sharing photos can help older adults feel connected and loved.Make movie magic: Plan a time to virtually connect and watch a joyful movie together. It might be a classic, an option that's been on your must-see list for a while, or a new release. A video meeting app can work best for this activity as it allows for easy interaction as you watch your flick, plus you can see each other's reactions throughout the movie. For seniors who are less comfortable with technology, consider sending them your favorite film and theater treats to enjoy, and share your thoughts together later over the phone.Name that tune: Music is a special part of the human experience and our favorite songs can bring a smile any time of the year. Take time to make a playlist of your loved one's favorite music and send it as a gift in whatever manner is most easily accessible, digital or on CD. You can also plan a list of different songs and play them on random and guess to see who gets the most song titles right the fastest. Video and phone calls are also a great time for a sing-along or impromptu serenade!Get grandkids in on the fun: For grandparents, grandkids are their pride and joy. Invite your kids of all ages to participate in activities, including singing contests, book reading, board games, crafts and more. Even a simple conversation sharing their interests, what's happening at school and any craft projects is a pure joy. Also consider asking grandma and grandpa to have a Zoom class to teach kids a treasured craft, activity or recipe. And many seniors love to connect with children in their community, so consider having kids write cards or draw pictures for seniors that may be feeling lonely or isolated.Become baking buddies: If you both have the ability, it can be a fun experience to bake together simultaneously. You might try a new recipe or one that is a family tradition. Get all the ingredients ready and then set a time to meet online virtually to start chopping, mixing and blending until you bake and compare results. Kids love participating in kitchen adventures as well. You can also make your favorite treats and gift them to seniors in your local area.'Having a connection is so important to so many seniors, which is why a simple act of kindness can mean the world even if that looks a little different this year,' says McManus."

Here are three ways to help promote reforms to Medicare Part D that could help lower out-of-pocket costs:1. Learn more about the issuesThe PAN Foundation offers many resources on www.panfoundation.org/advocate to help you learn more about Medicare Part D and potential reforms to help people pay less at the pharmacy counter for prescription medications.Additionally, signing up for healthcare newsletters, like the PAN Foundation newsletter, National Council on Aging newsletter or the Medicare Rights Center newsletter, will help you stay involved and informed.2. Write to your members of CongressConstituents can send a letter directly to their representatives and senators to ask them to pass legislation to lower out-of-pocket costs in Medicare Part D, such as setting an annual limit and evenly distributing these costs throughout the year.By using PAN’s “contact Congress” tool, you can quickly contact your elected officials and can even use a pre-written letter so that you don’t have to start from scratch.Before hitting send, consider adding your own story to the letter. Real-life examples can explain why reforms are necessary, and the impact that lower out-of-pocket prescription drug costs would have on your financial security and quality of life. Personal stories leave a lasting impression on legislators.3. Share your story on social mediaAnother easy way to advocate for reforms to Medicare Part D is to share information on social media. This can help you stay informed while also spreading important information to your network.Sharing your story about how you are impacted by high out-of-pocket costs and tagging your elected officials will help inform your friends and family about the changes needed to lower out-of-pocket costs for people on Medicare. The PAN Foundation has helpful resources for you to start advocating for changes to Medicare Part D on social media and encourage more people to contact their elected officials.Take actionWithout a limit on out-of-pocket costs, 45 million people on Medicare Part D will continue to struggle to fill their prescriptions and maintain their health.When the community raises its voices and collectively calls on elected officials, it could help people living with serious illnesses afford their life-saving medications.For more information, visit www.panfoundation.org/advocate."

Each plan provides a list of covered medications, which is available through the plan's website and customer service center.With the right tools and a trusted partner to provide guidance, it can be a simple process. Read the following tips to help pick a plan:#1: Consider a stand-alone or combination plan.In addition to examining out-of-pocket costs and what your plan covers, a good place to start when considering your options is to research a Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) and Medicare Advantage Prescription Plan (MAPD). A PDP is a stand-alone plan that only covers prescription drugs.

            "body": "With travel mostly on pause, many people are spending time at home with their families, dreaming about their next vacation. This time together creates the perfect opportunity to engage the whole family in planning the next adventure and make memories before the trip even begins.While, traditionally, parents take the lead in travel planning, a new family travel survey[1] revealed that three in five parents believe children are important resources for inspiration and ideas in planning family vacations.Further, one-third of those who don’t involve their children in travel planning say they would like to. Luckily, there are many ways to get your kids (from toddlers to teenagers) involved in the planning process, including a new family travel planning website.The site, BoldFamilyTravel.Chase.com, was created by The Marriott Bonvoy Bold™ Card in partnership with renowned family psychologist Dr. Jennifer L Hartstein, PsyD to engage and empower the whole family to be a part of the travel planning process.Families can start by creating their own personal travel profile or “VACAVATAR” (pronounced vei-kei-vuh-taar, VACAVATAR is a mashup of the words 'vacation' and 'avatar') on the site. After each family member has designed their own “VACAVATAR,” the website generates a list of recommended vacation destinations that best fit the family’s preferences. From there, users can explore other resources like tips for parents and kid-friendly content including coloring pages, travel-inspired word games and book and movie recommendations.On the site, Dr. Hartstein provides parents with tips on how to involve children of all ages in travel planning, including the below:Pre-schoolers and younger: Get inspiredBefore the trip, find books to read to your children or movies you can watch about different places and a variety of cultures. Young children are naturally curious, and you can help them begin to understand how diverse the world is, and how — through travel — they will be able to see and experience everything other places and cultures have to offer.School-age children: Collaborate, then assignWith older kids, you can include them in collaborating to choose your family’s destination. Then you can assign each child a particular vacation day to plan. Allow them to use online tools to choose where to go, what to do and where to eat. This gives them a sense of freedom and control, knowing that they are able to help make the trip memorable.Teens: Planning ownershipOnce you’ve chosen a destination together as a family, you can allow teenagers to be an active part of the planning process by not just making plans, but by actually setting them in motion. Whether it’s learning how to make dinner reservations or buying tickets to an event, giving teens ownership provides them with their first glance into the magical world of planning — as well as valuable life skills.Planning travel together as a family not only provides an opportunity to strengthen relationships and bond but allows children to build on core life skills like cooperation, compromise and communication. The survey found when children get involved in the planning process, the majority (68%) became more excited about the upcoming trip — and most respondents (81%) agreed planning ahead helped the family relax more when on vacation.While it will take some time for people to begin traveling again, most consumers (85%) surveyed anticipate traveling domestically again in the next 12 months, with 44% reporting that they would take a road trip and 43% saying they would stay in a hotel in the next six months. So if you’re one of them, you could benefit from involving your whole family in planning your next vacation together and creating new memories while you wait to travel again.To start planning together, visit BoldFamilyTravel.Chase.com to learn how everyone can get involved in dreaming about and designing your next trip, together.BoldFamilyTravel.Chase.com is empowered by The Marriott Bonvoy Bold™ Card, a no-annual fee travel rewards credit card, which offers 3X points on purchases at more than 7,000 hotels participating in Marriott Bonvoy, 2X points on other travel purchases, and 1X points on all other purchases.[1] Conducted by The Marriott Bonvoy BoldTM Card among 1,000 American parents or grandparents in 2020"

            "body": "For many families across America, fall is viewed as a time to reset and create new rituals, especially with key moments like back-to-school. We all know common routines have been disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which makes parenting more challenging than ever. This year, preventing illness at home is part of everyone’s focus. A simple runny nose could mean anything from the common cold or allergies to something more serious like the flu or COVID.'This fall, parents' #1 priority should be keeping their family healthy,' says Dr. Wendy Wright, adult and family nurse practitioner, owner of two family-health clinics and spokesperson for Advil. 'In addition to COVID-19 concerns, there's the typical cold and flu season to consider, with these dual threats unlike anything we’ve ever faced before. By being proactive and knowing smart steps to treat illness, you'll help support your family's well-being.'Wright recommends these three tips to help keep families healthy this fall:1. Wash and disinfect dailyWhenever you and your family re-enter the home, wash your hands right away with soap and water. Wash hands well for 20 seconds, or about the time it takes to sing 'Happy Birthday' twice. Washing your hands is one of the easiest, most effective ways to prevent the spread of germs.If soap and water aren’t readily available, the CDC recommends an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. You should apply the hand sanitizer gel in the palm of your hand, rub your hands together and then rub the gel on your hands and fingers for 20 seconds until they’re dry.You should also disinfect commonly touched items. For kids attending school, this means wiping down backpacks, lunch boxes inside and out and folders used to bring paperwork to and from school each day. If done according to directions on the disinfectant, this helps kill germs and can further lower the risk of spreading infection.2. Monitor and treat a feverThis cold and flu season, monitoring and treating fevers are more important than ever to reduce the spread of germs. Readings at or over 100.4 F indicate a fever and may be a sign of underlying illness. Keep family members at home if they have a fever and treat as necessary with Advil to reduce fever and relieve minor aches and pain associated with the common cold or flu. There are different types of Advil that your entire family can use to ensure everybody in your home has options.3. Set routines to prioritize healthRoutines bring structure to the day, something that will be key this fall when kids are back in school, be it in-person, at-home or a hybrid approach. Now that kids are waking up earlier, they also need to go to bed early, so it's important to set a sleep routine for your family. Adequate sleep provides energy, helps students focus at school and supports a healthy immune system.The CDC recommends these sleep guidelines depending on your child’s age:A well-balanced diet is also important for a healthy household. The CDC recommends the following healthy eating habits:Parents should also ask kids how they are feeling both mentally and physically and note any symptoms. Of course, if someone feels ill or is showing signs of sickness, stay home and seek immediate medical attention from your family doctor, local pharmacist or other healthcare provider.'This fall will be different than what we’re used to,' says Wright. 'With a positive attitude and proactive planning, you can support your family's wellness and help them thrive educationally.'"

            "body": "Going to the dentist has always been an important part of the overall health care routine. Even now, regular dental appointments are critical to good overall health and it is safe to see your dentist.You have questions. Will I be safe? Is my dental office following precautions? What should I do if I’m still nervous? These are realistic considerations in the COVID-19 world we now live in.Dentists are taking all possible measures to ensure the safety of their patients, staff and themselves. It's important patients keep up with their preventive and routine dental care to support their overall health. The Academy of General Dentistry (AGD) says it is normal to have anxiety and want to delay your routine dental appointment out of concern for coronavirus exposure. Before you decide to do so, contact your dentist and ask about their current operating procedures designed to ensure your safety.“Dentists have been applying extensive infection control standards in their practices for decades,” says Sheila Samaddar, DDS, a general dentist in Washington, D.C., and member of the AGD. “Infection control tools such as masks, gloves and gowns have long been required in all practices. We followed strict procedures before COVID-19 and since have expanded those measures to ensure all spaces in dental offices are disinfected too.”Here’s what to know when planning and visiting your dentist during this time.First, your dentist’s office has taken the recommended measures to make sure your visit is safe and they are ready to treat you.“We care about our patients and want to ensure their safety,” Lorna Flamer-Caldera, DDS, FAGD, a general dentist in Greenwich Village, New York, and a member of AGD, says. “Your dentist and their practice have put thoughtful procedures in place to make sure you and your family are protected, adhering to guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other state and local agencies. They’re altering check-in procedures, increasing the pieces of personal protective equipment worn by staff, minimizing person-to person contact, and have enhanced cleaning and sterilization.”New check-in procedures, including screening procedures and social distancing strategies, are designed to protect patients and staff during a dental appointment.“Your oral and overall health is our priority, and we are asking patients a few screening questions in advance of appointments,” adds Flamer-Caldera. “We are also asking patients to wait outside or in their vehicle prior to the appointment, wear a mask within the office when not being seen or treated by the dentist, or stay home and reschedule if you are feeling unwell the day of your appointment.”Second, delaying your dental care may result in additional and more costly problems in the future.“Scheduling that overdue dental appointment is more important than ever now, as dental offices are working to manage patients who put off treatment during COVID-19,” says Dr. Samaddar. “Patients should visit the dentist regularly to ensure that dental problems are caught early. In addition to teeth cleaning, we screen patients for oral cancer and other conditions. This is an important part of taking care of your overall health.“You may end up having to undergo and pay more for procedures that professional intervention could have prevented early on,” says Dr. Samaddar. “Early detection and routine professional care typically improve overall oral wellness outcomes.”Third, feelings of anxiety caused by the pandemic may be difficult for patients, compounding fears and making it difficult for some to schedule an appointment. Talk to your dentist about your concerns.“We are familiar with dental anxiety and helping patients work through their fears,” says Flamer-Caldera. “Give your dentist a call to address your concerns, as many of your needs can be resolved simply by talking about them.

            "html": "<p>Going to the dentist has always been an important part of the overall health care routine. Even now, regular dental appointments are critical to good overall health and it is safe to see your dentist.</p><p>You have questions. Will I be safe? Is my dental office following precautions? What should I do if I’m still nervous? These are realistic considerations in the COVID-19 world we now live in.</p><p>Dentists are taking all possible measures to ensure the safety of their patients, staff and themselves. It's important patients keep up with their preventive and routine dental care to support their overall health. The Academy of General Dentistry (AGD) says it is normal to have anxiety and want to delay your routine dental appointment out of concern for coronavirus exposure. Before you decide to do so, contact your dentist and ask about their current operating procedures designed to ensure your safety.</p><p>“Dentists have been applying extensive infection control standards in their practices for decades,” says Sheila Samaddar, DDS, a general dentist in Washington, D.C., and member of the AGD. “Infection control tools such as masks, gloves and gowns have long been required in all practices. We followed strict procedures before COVID-19 and since have expanded those measures to ensure all spaces in dental offices are disinfected too.”</p><p>Here’s what to know when planning and visiting your dentist during this time.</p><p>First, your dentist’s office has taken the recommended measures to make sure your visit is safe and they are ready to treat you.</p><p>“We care about our patients and want to ensure <s></s>their safety,” Lorna Flamer-Caldera, DDS, FAGD, a general dentist i<s></s>n Greenwich Village, New York, and a member of AGD, says. “Your dentist and their practice have put thoughtful procedures in place to make sure you and your family are protected, adhering to guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other state and local agencies. They’re altering check-in procedures, increasing the pieces of personal protective equipment worn by staff, minimizing person-to person contact, and have enhanced cleaning and sterilization.”</p><p>New check-in procedures, including screening procedures and social distancing strategies, are designed to protect patients and staff during a dental appointment.</p><p>“Your oral and overall health is our priority, and we are asking patients a few screening questions in advance of appointments,” adds Flamer-Caldera. “We are also asking patients to wait outside or in their vehicle prior to the appointment, wear a mask within the office when not being seen or treated by the dentist, or stay home and reschedule if you are feeling unwell the day of your appointment.”</p><p>Second, delaying your dental care may result in additional and more costly problems in the future.</p><p>“Scheduling that overdue dental appointment is more important than ever now, as dental offices are working to manage patients who put off treatment during COVID-19,” says Dr. Samaddar. “Patients should visit the dentist regularly to ensure that dental problems are caught early. In addition to teeth cleaning, we screen patients for oral cancer and other conditions. This is an important part of taking care of your overall health.</p><p>“You may end up having to undergo and pay more for procedures that professional intervention could have prevented early on,” says Dr. Samaddar. “Early detection and routine professional care typically improve overall oral wellness outcomes.”</p><p>Third, feelings of anxiety caused by the pandemic may be difficult for patients, compounding fears and making it difficult for some to schedule an appointment.

While back-to-school preparations this year may include setting up space for virtual learning at home, going back to the classroom, or a combination model, they should also include making sure your child or children have health insurance. But if they don’t, it is not too late to get them covered!Studies have shown that academic performance and health insurance go hand in hand. Children who have health coverage miss fewer classes and perform better in school than those who are uninsured. Even more, health coverage doesn’t just benefit students. Fewer missed days of school also mean fewer missed days of work for parents. With health coverage, children can get the routine and emergency care, immunizations, check-ups, eye exams, dental visits and mental health services they may need to fully participate in school and remain engaged in class. Health coverage also provides access to the seasonal flu vaccine and important care if children get sick or injured.Nationwide, millions of children and teens qualify — and are enrolled — in free or low-cost health coverage through Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). These health programs can provide vital access to care to keep students focused on learning and give parents the peace of mind that comes with knowing their children are covered inside and outside the classroom.Over the last few months, many families may have postponed medical appointments due to COVID-19. Millions of school-aged children who do not have health coverage may qualify for Medicaid and CHIP. The start of the school year provides a good opportunity to catch up on important well-child visits and ensure children are up-to-date on their immunizations. Vaccinations, such as those for seasonal influenza, are particularly important this year. Not only can they protect children from getting sick and developing serious complications, they can also protect others who may be vulnerable to serious illness as a result of the flu, such as babies and other young children, older people, and people with pre-existing health conditions. Medicaid and CHIP cover recommended routine vaccinations, including the seasonal flu.Medicaid and CHIP provide free or low-cost health insurance for eligible children and teens up to age 19. Eligibility is dependent on household size and income and varies by state. On average, a family of four earning up to $50,000 a year or more may qualify for Medicaid and CHIP. Enrollment is open all year but health coverage must be renewed annually.You can apply online, over the phone, by mail or in-person with your state’s Medicaid or CHIP agency or visit the “Find Coverage for Your Family” section on InsureKidsNow.gov.

            "body": "While coordinating regular family meals can sometimes be challenging, the benefits of spending time around the table with loved ones are definitely worth the extra effort. Family meals not only help strengthen relationship bonds, but can also be linked to higher self-esteem, positive social behaviors and higher grades in school for kids.Check out these five simple tips that you can follow to improve the quality time spent around the table enjoying your favorite family meals:Reduce the rush: If you allow around 20-30 minutes for family meals, it gives your children plenty of time to eat. They’ll have the chance to try new foods and develop good eating habits. This also gives you time to relax, chat and enjoy your family. If you have a toddler who finds it hard to sit still for 20 minutes, let him or her move around a bit.Think beyond dinner: Family meals can happen at any time of day, not just at dinner. In fact, many families find breakfast is an easier opportunity to eat together before the busy day gets underway. Not to mention, kicking off the morning with a nutritious meal is a great way to stay fueled for the rest of the day.Opt for nutritious ingredients: Registered Dietitian and Nutritionist Dawn Jackson Blatner recommends incorporating nutritious ingredients into family meals to instill healthier eating habits for the future. For instance, Eggland’s Best eggs contain superior nutrition, freshness and taste compared to ordinary eggs at the grocery store. In fact, EB eggs are richer in a variety of micronutrients that can help support a healthy immune system, including six times more vitamin D, 10 times more vitamin E and more than double the vitamin B12 and omega-3s.Be a role model: From table etiquette and respectful conversation to eating well-rounded dishes and trying new foods, remember that the little ones are soaking up your behaviors like a sponge. Children will reflect what they see you doing, so speak kindly, remember to use manners and grab an extra helping of veggies or eggs for a boost of vitamins and nutrients.Rotate recipes: Keep meals lively by trying new dishes. Don't be afraid to change things up and get creative, such as starting the day the right way with Eggland’s Best’s fun twist on pizza for breakfast that kids of all ages will love.Sunny Side Breakfast PizzaIngredients:1 can refrigerated pizza crust, or fresh pizza dough (homemade or store-purchased)2 tomatoes, thinly sliced1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, low-fat1/2 cup spinach leaves, chopped6-8 basil leaves, chopped4 Eggland's Best eggs2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped1 tablespoon oregano1/2 teaspoon saltDirections:Eggland’s Best (EB) is also a proud supporter of the American Heart Association’s (AHA) Healthy for Good™, which encourages people to take small steps every day to build lifelong healthy habits for themselves and for their families."

The disease can progress quickly and be fatal, sometimes within 24 hours.<sup>[1]</sup> Although it’s uncommon, one in ten of those who contract it will die, and one in five will suffer long-term consequences, such as loss of limbs, like Jamie.<sup>[2]</sup></p><p>The decrease in immunization rates for vaccine-preventable diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic could impact the health of our communities, including schools and students living on college campuses.<sup>[3],[4] </sup>Adolescents and young adults are at an increased risk for meningitis due to close contact with each other, sharing drinks or eating utensils, kissing or coughing.<sup>[5],[6],[7]</sup></p><p>Go to <a href=\"http://www.meningitisB.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">www.meningitisB.com</a> to educate yourself about meningitis and the two different types of vaccines needed to help protect your teen against the five vaccine-preventable groups of meningitis — A, C, W, Y and B.<sup>[8]</sup></p><p>“I am grateful my daughter survived meningitis, but others may not be as lucky as Jamie. As parents, it is our responsibility to educate ourselves about meningitis and more important than ever that we speak with our children’s doctors about adolescent vaccinations, like meningitis. It’s extremely important to utilize the vaccines we do have to help protect our kids against vaccine-preventable diseases amidst a pandemic.”</p><p>Vaccination may not protect all recipients.

He never woke up — and as a father, I never got to say goodbye.”GSK spokesperson and meningitis advocate Greg Williams’ son, Nicolis ‘Nico’, was a 20-year-old student at a university in Texas when he contracted meningococcal disease, also known as meningitis.Nico’s symptoms began with a severe headache after a night out with friends. The next day, Nico’s headache progressed to flu-like symptoms, and after a visit to the student health clinic, he returned home to rest. Hours later, he was rushed to the emergency room and diagnosed with meningitis B (MenB), which would ultimately cost him his life.Unfortunately, stories like Nico’s could become more common.

And when time is short and your crew is tired, the last thing you need to be doing is spending ages in the kitchen.Here are some solutions for making cooking at home easy — and delicious. All it takes is a little planning, a few kitchen tools, and a few family-friendly recipes.1. Use your air fryerIt’s time to pull that air fryer out from the back of the pantry. Many people own this unique tool, but it can sometimes feel overwhelming to use it. The key to getting the most out of your kitchen equipment is planning ahead. Preheat your air fryer before adding your food. Simply turn the air fryer on to the temperature that you need and set the timer for 2 or 3 minutes. When the timer goes off, the air fryer has preheated and is ready for your food.A pro tip we like to share: Don’t overcrowd the basket of your air fryer or else you’ll prevent foods from crisping and browning evenly.You can easily convert some of your favorite meals from conventional cooking to air fryer usage. The good news? You can make an air fryer meal for any time of day and enjoy a meal without getting any dishes dirty.2. Schedule meal prep for the weekendIf you have the time, you will certainly be happy to find your casseroles, stews, pasta dishes and other meals completely ready to eat each evening. Just cooking up some make-ahead dishes like a Cheesy Shrimp Bake or a Crab Quiche during the weekend could free you from kitchen duty a night or two during the week.If you don’t have time to prep entire meals beforehand, there are still some little things you can do to help reduce your daily cooking time. For example:3. Keep quick, tasty options at-the-readyWhether you’re grabbing a quick bite between Zoom meetings, creating a home-gating spread to watch the game, or just having a fun date night in, frozen seafood is a great option to keep on-hand. Luckily, the frozen seafood aisle has so many products to choose from. Some products that deliver on quality, taste and convenience are SeaPak’s Budweiser Beer Battered Shrimp, Budweiser Beer Battered Cod and Budweiser Beer Battered Crab Poppers.For a restaurant-inspired experience at home, try making these Budweiser Beer Battered Shrimp Lettuce Cups with Mango Avocado Salsa. For this recipe, you could also try making the shrimp in the air fryer since you have it out of storage already. The good news is you do not need to defrost the frozen shrimp before you start cooking them.

            "title": "5 ways to make a difference in a senior’s life",

            "body": "Did you know that by 2040, 20% of Americans will be 65 and older? As the population of older adults increases, it’s crucial to recognize and celebrate the rich depth of experience, talents and unique perspectives of such a large segment of the country. Yet, all too often, older people are overlooked and undervalued.Eve Gelb, senior vice president of member and community health for SCAN Health Plan, which provides Medicare Advantage coverage to more than 200,000 older Americans, describes ways to “shine a light” on older people in a TEDx talk from February 2020. Her advice for connecting meaningfully with seniors is even more vital in the pandemic landscape, when so many have become isolated from friends and family.Gelb stresses the importance of empathy — the ability to imagine what someone else's experience is like. She says empathy is crucial for understanding and shining a light on people who might otherwise become withdrawn and disconnected from their communities. To show empathy, Gelb says you need to engage with and be curious about people, listen to them deeply, and appreciate their value.“When people aren’t actively engaged, they decline, and they decline faster,” says Gelb. “Human interaction has been shown to slow the aging process.”How to connect with seniors in your communityGelb recommends what she calls “micro-volunteering.” Similar to other kinds of volunteering, micro-volunteering offers the opportunity to brighten someone else’s life — and reap the rewards of feeling good by knowing you made someone else feel good.However, unlike regular volunteering, micro-volunteering does not demand a huge time commitment or a major change to your lifestyle. It simply means finding small ways throughout your daily life to shine a little light on someone who could benefit from the help, the empathy and the attention — even for just a short time — to feel more included in the world around them.Here are simple ways you can micro-volunteer to make a difference in a senior’s life:1. Call every weekMake it a regular habit to call your older friend, neighbor or family member each week, so they have a friendly conversation to look forward to. Ask them about their life, and tell them stories about yours. Gelb says this is an activity SCAN encourages by offering employees paid time off to volunteer.2. Offer to pick something upOffering to get some groceries or a prescription for an older person can make their lives a lot easier. Don’t wait to be asked for help, as someone living alone may be reluctant to reach out. Just call and say, “I’m heading out to the store — can I pick something up for you?”3. Help them stay safeMake sure any vulnerable person you know has face masks, hand sanitizer and the ability to order or ask for what they need. Mask up and offer to help them sanitize their doorknobs and phone after you drop by with a delivery. Help them use video conferencing to communicate with family members or friends.4. Find ways to keep them engagedDrop by with a care package containing things they might like to do: a jigsaw puzzle, a deck of cards, large print books or crosswords. If you’re a good cook or have a green thumb, bring them a sample of your latest dish, offer to help with yard work, or bring them a plant that’s easy to care for — and that gives you a reason to stop by to check on them next time.5. Be their tech supportTo communicate with the outside world, older people may have to rely on smartphones, computers or tablets that can sometimes be complicated or confusing to use. Teach them how to use apps like Zoom, set up a charging station for their phone or tablet, reboot devices so they run better — or just ask if they’re having any problems accessing their email or using their phone.Making a regular connection, especially with someone who lives alone, can have a huge impact on their overall well-being.

Yet, all too often, older people are overlooked and undervalued.</p><p>Eve Gelb, senior vice president of member and community health for SCAN Health Plan, which provides Medicare Advantage coverage to more than 200,000 older Americans, describes ways to “shine a light” on older people in a <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZugDDhxdO0M__;!!G1p3e_M!LW5NVJXhtd7HT76R8WfeR7owvcSboq7c2k0R5iLmqaRqzubJTUBYGUcFV8dXNsBSVg%24\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TEDx talk</a> from February 2020. Her advice for connecting meaningfully with seniors is even more vital in the pandemic landscape, when so many have become isolated from friends and family.</p><p>Gelb stresses the importance of empathy — the ability to imagine what someone else's experience is like. She says empathy is crucial for understanding and shining a light on people who might otherwise become withdrawn and disconnected from their communities. To show empathy, Gelb says you need to engage with and be curious about people, listen to them deeply, and appreciate their value.</p><p>“When people aren’t actively engaged, they decline, and they decline faster,” says Gelb. “Human interaction has been shown to slow the aging process.”</p><p><strong>How to connect with seniors in your community</strong></p><p>Gelb recommends what she calls “micro-volunteering.” Similar to other kinds of volunteering, micro-volunteering offers the opportunity to brighten someone else’s life — and reap the rewards of feeling good by knowing you made someone else feel good.</p><p>However, unlike regular volunteering, micro-volunteering does not demand a huge time commitment or a major change to your lifestyle. It simply means finding small ways throughout your daily life to shine a little light on someone who could benefit from the help, the empathy and the attention — even for just a short time — to feel more included in the world around them.</p><p>Here are simple ways you can micro-volunteer to make a difference in a senior’s life:</p><p><strong>1. Call every week</strong></p><p>Make it a regular habit to call your older friend, neighbor or family member each week, so they have a friendly conversation to look forward to. Ask them about their life, and tell them stories about yours. Gelb says this is an activity SCAN encourages by offering employees paid time off to volunteer.</p><p><strong>2. Offer to pick something up</strong></p><p>Offering to get some groceries or a prescription for an older person can make their lives a lot easier. Don’t wait to be asked for help, as someone living alone may be reluctant to reach out. Just call and say, “I’m heading out to the store — can I pick something up for you?”</p><p><strong>3. Help them stay safe</strong></p><p>Make sure any vulnerable person you know has face masks, hand sanitizer and the ability to order or ask for what they need. Mask up and offer to help them sanitize their doorknobs and phone after you drop by with a delivery. Help them use video conferencing to communicate with family members or friends.</p><p><strong>4. Find ways to keep them engaged</strong></p><p>Drop by with a care package containing things they might like to do: a jigsaw puzzle, a deck of cards, large print books or crosswords. If you’re a good cook or have a green thumb, bring them a sample of your latest dish, offer to help with yard work, or bring them a plant that’s easy to care for — and that gives you a reason to stop by to check on them next time.</p><p><strong>5. Be their tech support</strong></p><p>To communicate with the outside world, older people may have to rely on smartphones, computers or tablets that can sometimes be complicated or confusing to use. Teach them how to use apps like Zoom, set up a charging station for their phone or tablet, reboot devices so they run better — or just ask if they’re having any problems accessing their email or using their phone.</p><p>Making a regular connection, especially with someone who lives alone, can have a huge impact on their overall well-being.

This October, let’s kick-off the Halloween magic earlier than ever in new, exciting ways.Think outside the trick-or-treat bagConsider setting up a home and/or backyard scavenger hunt, where kids have to follow and solve strategically placed clues to find bags of treats or surprises.You could celebrate with a Halloween-themed piñata or fill small plastic pumpkins with your favorite Hershey candies, like the new Kit Kat® Witch’s Brew and classic Reese’s Peanut Butter Pumpkins, to hang from tree branches or on your porch.Sort through old closets and drawers to involve kids in repurposing outgrown outfits into a unique homemade costume this year. Encourage the kids to help you add Halloween touches around your house such as using stretched-out cotton balls or cheesecloth for cobwebs to enjoy throughout the month.Halloween barkWant to keep your little ones busy with an activity that’s not only fun, but tasty too? Try making some Halloween bark. It’s super easy, and the kids will love it.'To make the bark extra special, I use Hershey’s Cookies ‘N’ Crème Fangs,' says Santaniello. 'They’re the snack-size sensation of the season — and brand new! Your little vampires will love the fierce fang prints.'To make the bark, melt white chocolate and add food coloring in festive Halloween colors, like orange and purple.

Using the new half green crème and half milk chocolate Reese’s Cup as the base, cut a small cookie in half to create the bat wings. Frosting will be the “glue” to connect the cookie to the Reese’s Cup, to create wings, and then add small candy eyes. Put a little frosting under each eye to help it stick. Super easy!'Joining the Hershey Halloween Squad was a perfect fit for me, because Halloween is one of my favorite times of the year,' said Santeniello.

Everyone is coping with a lot — from anxiety about the pandemic and financial worries to stress around work and family schedules, and so much more. According to a CDC survey this June, over 30% of the respondents reported symptoms of an anxiety or depressive disorder. With so much stress and anxiety this year, many people find themselves sick to their stomachs — literally.If anxiety is making you or a family member feel nauseated, you may have looked for over-the-counter remedies, which can make people feel drowsy or that you may worry about giving to children.“Both adults and children can experience symptoms like nausea due to anxiety,” said family practitioner Dr. Ian Cracknell. “But fortunately, there are non-medicinal strategies available for reducing these symptoms.”If you’re looking for safer, natural ways to help relieve your anxiety-related nausea without adverse side effects, there are options that can help make you or your loved one feel better soon.Try these tips to help relieve nausea due to anxiety.1. Enjoy some hot herbal tea Sipping particular beverages slowly has been shown to help reduce feelings of nausea.

Sip a fizzy cold beverageIf you prefer cold beverages, try:Whichever beverage you try, sip slowly to give your stomach time to settle down.3. Harness the power of acupressureOne acupressure point in the wrist, termed the P6 (or Nei Guan in Chinese medicine), can help relieve nausea and upset stomach when pressure is applied. With a specially designed wrist band from Sea-Band Nausea Relief, this acupressure point is stimulated by a plastic stud attached to the inside of the band. You can adjust the soft, comfortable wrist band to fit snugly on your wrist (or on a child age 3 and up) to help relieve nausea within minutes. The bands even come in child-size packs.A University of Pittsburgh Medical Center study showed that using Sea-Band acupressure wrist bands on post-operative patients reduced the incidence of nausea to 10%.“Sea-Bands are a low-cost, effective and drug-free alternative that I often recommend to patients,” said Dr. Cracknell. “They are clinically proven to reduce nausea in patients due to a variety of causes — from anxiety and migraines to motion sickness and morning sickness.”Former high-risk maternity nurse, acupuncture student and mom Sheri H. used Sea-Bands to reduce her morning sickness, and she recommends them for anyone experiencing nausea, no matter the cause: “I highly recommend them personally and professionally, for all women who experience nausea during pregnancy. And I’m sure these help with all kinds of medical nausea — post-operative, chemo, etc.”Whether your children are stressed about their new school routine or you’re feeling anxious managing the “new normal,” Sea-Band provides one easy-to-use source of relief to reduce those queasy feelings.For more information on Sea-Bands and how they work, visit Sea-Band.com/FAQs.4. Enjoy the benefits of aromatherapyRecent interest in essential oils and aromatherapy has caught the attention of the medical establishment. For example, patients at the Mayo Clinic who suffered from nausea were offered cotton balls with a few drops of ginger or spearmint to breathe in, which helped them cope with feelings of queasiness.A recent study published by the National Institutes of Health concluded that controlled breathing exercises and peppermint aromatherapy can be helpful, with over half (57%) of the participants discovering that the peppermint helped them feel less nauseated, and 62% finding relief with the breathing exercises.Others have found that inhaling citrus scents, like that of a freshly cut lemon, can help.5. Inhale fresh airBreathing exercises do help many who suffer from anxiety-related nausea, as does simple exposure to fresh air. Walking outside, meditating or doing deep breathing exercises are all worth a try for relieving not just the nausea, but some of the underlying stress or anxiety as well."

The Halloween Safety guidelines — available on Halloween2020.org — are consistent with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Holiday Celebrations Guidelines and include a color-coded COVID risk level map, provided by the Harvard Global Health Institute.“Families and policy-makers need clear and consistent information when it comes to COVID-19 risks to inform decision-making, including how to participate safely in the upcoming Halloween holiday and trick-or-treating activities associated with it,” said Dr. Ingrid Katz, Infectious Diseases Expert, and Associate Faculty Director at the Harvard Global Health Institute. “Through our interactive COVID risk level map, we hope to provide parents a reliable source to help them celebrate the Halloween holiday in the most safe, fun way possible according to the risk level in their community.”With most of the country in the moderate risk category, it’s likely that many communities and families will find new ways to celebrate this year, including neighborhood trick-or-treat drive-ups, reverse trick-or-treating and neighborhood or backyard candy hunts. These creative celebration ideas allow for fun and safety to remain a top priority.“Halloween is more important than ever this year as we navigate the new normal together and are seeking opportunities to celebrate safely. We’re inspired by the public-private partnerships and groups coming together that all have a shared value of celebrating Halloween safely,” says Chuck Raup, president, U.S., The Hershey Company.The takeaway: There are many fun and safe ways to celebrate this Halloween season, from carving pumpkins to having Halloween-themed movie nights with your favorite Halloween treats like Hershey’s, Reese’s and Kit Kat.Here are some tips and ideas for celebrating safely based on your risk zone color:Yellow zonesFocus on trick-or-treat safety. A Halloween neighborhood parade is a good option for yellow zones. Organize a neighborhood costume parade where the route is predetermined and marked to maintain safe distances between participants. Stay safe by incorporating sanitization stations, yellow caution tape, 6-foot sidewalk stickers/tape and age group signs. Or, do the reverse and have kids decked out in their costumes in the front yard as neighbors walk or drive by and deliver candy from a safe distance.Orange zonesFor orange-zone communities, let the treats come to you. Trick-or-treat in reverse by having kids wear their costumes in the front yard as neighbors walk or drive by and deliver candy. Another option is a trick-or-treat drive-by where you wear costumes and then drive to visit friends and family in costume and deliver some treats! Honk, text or shout upon arrival and deliver some treats or tricks in costume to your favorite folks!Red zonesAt-home celebrations are safest for red zones. Consider planning a Halloween movie night or a virtual costume party. You can also make this a special time with a scavenger hunt throughout your home. Create different themed rooms throughout the house and send the kids on a scavenger hunt for fun swag. Hide candy, toys and prizes or even make some gift certificates to stay up late, choose the movie or eat an extra piece of candy. Keep the big kids engaged with trickier clues and fun age-appropriate rewards.Even with the extra precautions and adjustments needed to ensure a safe celebration, Halloween 2020 still promises to be a once-in-a-lifetime experience. In fact, a Halloween such as this won’t happen again for at least another 152 years. Not only does Halloween 2020 fall on a Saturday, it also happens to be a full moon and daylight saving time. Additionally, the day occurs during a blue moon this year, the second full moon of October.For more information, visit HersheyHappiness.com."

            "body": "Quality smartphones come in all configurations and price points these days. Here are some of the key things you’ll want to look for to make sure you find one that works best for your needs. Happy shopping!Operating system (OS): There are two different operating systems to choose from. iOS works with iPhones, while Android operates with a wider variety of smartphones, like those from Samsung or Motorola. In general, iOS is considered easier to use, but you need to have an Apple device. Android gives you more options, plus the ability to customize it with third-party software and widgets.Camera: Most people now use their phones as their primary camera, so the right selection here will be an especially important one. More and more smartphones boast cameras with at least 12 mega-pixels, so don't go by only that stat. Instead, focus on individual camera specs and special features like dual lenses or the ability to edit and enhance photos.Screen size: Get the right size screen for the things you’ll want to do. Buy a phone with a screen smaller than 5.5 inches if one-hand use is important to you or if you have smaller hands. Get a bigger-screen phone if you like to watch a lot of videos or play games, or simply want to have an easier time navigating on your touchscreen.Display: You’re going to spend many hours gazing at the screen, so make sure it offers the viewing experience you’re after. If you plan to watch a lot of videos, look for a minimum of full HD (high definition), which is 1920 x 1080 pixels. You’ll also want to familiarize yourself with some of the underlying technologies: LCD, OLED, and AMOLED are all terms you’ll see used, and each offers a different range of advantages.Design: Determining good smartphone design is purely subjective. Many people prefer a metal or glass design; others, plastic. If you’re concerned about durability, look for a phone that is water-resistant. A handful of phones also now feature a shatterproof glass display, and many include a Gorilla Glass display to protect it against short drops (a protective case will help with that, too).Processor: Even midrange phones now offer satisfactory performance for nearly any user level or basic task. A good processor inside a phone will translate to faster open times for apps, smoother navigation and quicker photo editing.Battery: Many factors, including the screen size, processor and operating system, determine how long a smartphone lasts on a charge. A decent benchmark is to look for a smartphone with a battery capacity of at least 3,000 mAh. Any phone that lasts longer than 9 hours of straight 4G LTE use is considered very good.Storage: Go for as much internal storage as possible. Some apps and games can easily take up more than 1GB of storage, and most smartphone owners capture and store large numbers of high-res photos and videos. While some models offer just 8GB or 16GB, the minimum on premium handsets these days is usually anywhere from 32GB–64GB. Adding a microSD card will also help expand your storage. It's available on many Android phones, some of which can accommodate 1TB or more.Price: Don’t pay for more than you need. The latest iPhone and premium Android phones start around $800, and can easily run $1,000 or more. But there are great options below $500, and even some solid choices for well under $200.Carrier: A smartphone requires a wireless plan. Choose a service provider that offers what you’ll really use, and at a price that suits your budget. Consumer Cellular, for example, offers a wide variety of smartphone choices from entry level to top of the line, along with talk, text and data plans for as low as $20 a month, with no contract.Let today’s top technology work for you! It’s a very competitive marketplace, so by shopping wisely, you’re sure to find a smartphone that keeps you happily connected at a great price."

            "body": "Easy to make, packed with nutrients and great for the entire family, scrambled eggs are a breakfast staple in households across the country. While the classic scramble is a great go-to, these days you might be looking to jazz things up a bit. You can excite taste buds with interesting additions, nutritious upgrades and simple twists on traditional scrambled eggs. Co-host of Food Network's 'The Kitchen,' and season seven winner of 'Food Network Star' Jeff Mauro reveals five ways to bring your scrambled eggs to the next level.1. Experiment with dairy ingredientsMany people add milk to eggs when mixing to create a fluffy, scrumptious scramble. However, you can get creative in the kitchen by changing up the dairy in your eggs to discover new and tasty results. For example, try half-and-half or cream for a richer scramble. A dollop of plain yogurt, sour cream or mayo adds a touch of zing. Cheese is another awesome addition, and you can go beyond a sprinkle of shredded cheddar to try cream cheese, mascarpone or cottage cheese for a delicious, filling breakfast.2. Add veggies, herbs and spicesScrambled eggs are a great base that is completely customizable for what you're craving that day. Chop up fresh veggies like peppers, onions and tomato. Short on time? Add some salsa. For fresh flavor, add chopped herbs such as dill, thyme or rosemary. Want bold flavor? Try adding curry powder or reach for seasoning mixes such as Italian seasoning or Cajun seasoning blends. You might even try a dash of condiments and other extras like mustard, Worcestershire sauce or soy sauce.3. Use superior eggs for better nutritionWhile you can scramble any egg, not all eggs are created equal when it comes to nutrition. Stock your fridge with great-tasting Eggland’s Best (EB) eggs that contain more than six times the vitamin D and 10 times more vitamin E compared to ordinary eggs — two powerful micronutrients that can help shield your body from harmful bacteria and support a healthy immune system. What's more, EB eggs also contain 25% less saturated fat and more than double the omega-3s and vitamin B12. A better egg equals a better recipe.4. Leftover transformationWith some simple tweaks, you can transform dinner leftovers into a satisfying scramble. Whether you've got leftover meat, greens or even too much pizza, you can serve up a tasty, easy breakfast thanks to last night's meal. And another added bonus, it’s a great way to clean out the fridge and reduce food waste!5. Go beyond the plateEgg scrambles are great just eating as is, but when you add them into other foods and recipes, you really can shake things up. For example, add scrambles on top of your burger or sandwich. A chilled scramble can be a wonderful topping for a fresh salad instead of the traditional hard-boiled egg. Add it as a pizza topping any time of day.

            "body": "There’s no doubt these are stressful times. Due to the pandemic, everyone's lives have been turned upside down. This is especially true for families coping with altered routines at school, learning from home or both. Children are stressed about their routines, and parents are anxious, too.Emily Hanley, mother of 6-year-old Cameron, said this year became increasingly challenging for her family. “Bedtimes got later, meals were refused, and every little choice became a battle. We all put up a strong front for those first six months, until getting back into a school routine threw us off,” she said.How children learn to copeResearch has shown that children often cope with stress by projecting their feelings and worries onto toys, stuffed animals and dolls. The Committee for Children, a global nonprofit leader in social-emotional learning, spent more than three years studying this concept, and then teamed up with Sproutel, a play-focused design studio best known for toys like Jerry the Bear for children with type 1 diabetes and My Special Aflac Duck for children with cancer, to bring their research to life. The result of their collaboration? Purrble — an interactive toy designed to help children learn to self-soothe during stressful times.“When kids respond to stress with emotional outbursts, it can be hard on the whole family,” said Kate Gallo, product manager for Committee for Children's Innovation Lab. “Purrble isn't about getting rid of big feelings, but empowering kids to understand they’re in the driver's seat when big feelings happen. Research has proven children can learn to calm themselves by helping someone else calm down.”After trying everything from essential oils to meditation to calm her son, Hanley ordered a Purrble. “It hasn’t even been a full 24 hours, and my son is happily giving him a tour of our house and introducing him to his other stuffed animals. His job is to keep his Purrble calm and happy. I can already sense he is exuding calm to keep his little furry friend calm.”Enter: An unlikely remedyWhen Purrble is first turned on or is startled (for example by being turned upside down), their heart beats quickly, inviting kids to calm them down. High-tech sensors allow Purrble to respond to touch and fidgeting, so when kids pet their companion, Purrble’s vibrational heartbeat slows into a gentle purr.“As kids explore the toy, they learn to care for Purrble, interpreting the purrs, heartbeats and reactions,” said Aaron Horowitz, co-founder and CEO of Sproutel. “The discovery process helps kids to not only develop these self-calming skills but to take charge of how they learn.”According to research, when taught at a young age, these coping and social skills can lead to better long-term emotional, social and academic outcomes into adulthood, not to mention the benefits of in-the-moment self-soothing.“I could sense Cameron’s anxiety creeping in,” said Hanley, remembering the early months of the pandemic. “And how could it not?” However, for the Hanleys, Purrble made all the difference.And the Hanleys are not alone. In a preliminary study conducted with real families earlier this year, parents found that when their child was heading for a meltdown or just having a bad day, Purrble could help transform tantrums into moments of calm. In fact, of the 73% of these parents who reported their child was experiencing challenges with emotions, concentration and behavior during the pandemic, 91% of these said Purrble played a role in improving these struggles.“With the coronavirus, being home is extra challenging for everybody,” said mom Stephanie Blanchard, whose family participated in the trial. “It’s hard for kids to understand what’s going on. When my 6-year-old, Sophie, was stressed or having a tantrum, I would say, ‘Hey, go get Purrble. Can you calm Purrble down?’”A companion for all agesFrom parents and children to 20-somethings and grandparents, people of all ages are discovering the calming effect of Purrble — grandparents who ordered one for their grandchild and ended up loving Purrble so much they ordered another for themselves, young adults grappling with anxiety and even teachers using Purrble as a classroom management tool.In a year when everyone — kids and adults alike — is having a challenging time finding calm, Purrble is lending a paw."

The Committee for Children, a global nonprofit leader in social-emotional learning, spent more than three years studying this concept, and then teamed up with Sproutel, a play-focused design studio best known for toys like Jerry the Bear for children with type 1 diabetes and My Special Aflac Duck for children with cancer, to bring their research to life. The result of their collaboration? <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Purrble-Calming-Soothing-Interactive-Companion/dp/B08F5GZH84/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Purrble</a> — an interactive toy designed to help children learn to self-soothe during stressful times.</p><p>“When kids respond to stress with emotional outbursts, it can be hard on the whole family,” said Kate Gallo, product manager for Committee for Children's Innovation Lab. “Purrble isn't about getting rid of big feelings, but empowering kids to understand they’re in the driver's seat when big feelings happen. Research has proven children can learn to calm themselves by helping someone else calm down.”</p><p>After trying everything from essential oils to meditation to calm her son, Hanley ordered a Purrble. “It hasn’t even been a full 24 hours, and my son is happily giving him a tour of our house and introducing him to his other stuffed animals. His job is to keep his Purrble calm and happy. I can already sense he is exuding calm to keep his little furry friend calm.”</p><p><strong>Enter: An unlikely remedy</strong></p><p>When Purrble is first turned on or is startled (for example by being turned upside down), their heart beats quickly, inviting kids to calm them down. High-tech sensors allow Purrble to respond to touch and fidgeting, so when kids pet their companion, Purrble’s vibrational heartbeat slows into a gentle purr.</p><p>“As kids explore the toy, they learn to care for Purrble, interpreting the purrs, heartbeats and reactions,” said Aaron Horowitz, co-founder and CEO of Sproutel. “The discovery process helps kids to not only develop these self-calming skills but to take charge of how they learn.”</p><p>According to research, when taught at a young age, these coping and social skills can lead to better long-term emotional, social and academic outcomes into adulthood, not to mention the benefits of in-the-moment self-soothing.</p><p>“I could sense Cameron’s anxiety creeping in,” said Hanley, remembering the early months of the pandemic. “And how could it not?” However, for the Hanleys, Purrble made all the difference.</p><p>And the Hanleys are not alone. In a preliminary study conducted with real families earlier this year, parents found that when their child was heading for a meltdown or just having a bad day, Purrble could help transform tantrums into moments of calm. In fact, of the 73% of these parents who reported their child was experiencing challenges with emotions, concentration and behavior during the pandemic, 91% of these said Purrble played a role in improving these struggles.<strong><br></strong><br>“With the coronavirus, being home is extra challenging for everybody,” said mom Stephanie Blanchard, whose family participated in the trial. “It’s hard for kids to understand what’s going on. When my 6-year-old, Sophie, was stressed or having a tantrum, I would say, ‘Hey, go get Purrble. Can you calm Purrble down?’”</p><p><strong>A companion for all ages</strong></p><p>From parents and children to 20-somethings and grandparents, people of all ages are discovering the calming effect of Purrble — grandparents who ordered one for their grandchild and ended up loving Purrble so much they ordered another for themselves, young adults grappling with anxiety and even teachers using Purrble as a classroom management tool.</p><p>In a year when everyone — kids and adults alike — is having a challenging time finding calm, <a href=\"https://purrble.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Purrble</a> is lending a paw.</p>",

            "body": "You love spending time at home with your kids, but you might not have anticipated just how much time this would be at the start of the pandemic. Now that cold weather is sweeping the nation, families will be at home and indoors even more. Fortunately, the magic of imaginative play not only keeps kids busy, but it helps them develop critical skills that will serve them well throughout life.Active imaginative play has proven to be beneficial for kids, according to Scholastic, including skills development such as:Creative play nurtures budding imaginations and helps young brains develop in healthy, age-appropriate ways. As kids spend more time at home and in some cases away from preschools, classes and playdates, this is even more critical to fill in for lost learning opportunities. To inspire creative and dramatic play in your home any time of year, consider these fun ideas:Choose tech toys that promote hands-on creativity Kids are accustomed to having technology in their daily lives, so offering a low-tech toy strikes the perfect balance between sparking interest and encouraging hands-on, imaginative play. The BRIO Smart Tech Sound Action Tunnel Circle Set lets kids create their own world using a childhood favorite: trains. Kids can reinforce their fine motor skills by building train tracks, while the set’s ‘record-and-play’ function allows children to record their own sounds and integrate them into the play experience. The free Smart Tech Sound app also offers a simple remote control option for young hands, plus there are many options to expand your set for customized playing.Stock a play clothes bin with a variety of itemsEncourage your child’s sense of dramatic play by keeping a dedicated bin stocked with dress-up clothing. Fill it with old clothes, unused accessories, and former Halloween costumes and other fantasy wear. You’ll be amazed by their transformations and what new and inventive ways they use the items. Ask open-ended questions such as, “Where do you live?' and 'How do you feel?' to reinforce your child’s creative spirit. You might even capture some pretty awesome pictures and videos to document this unique year.Make mystery prop boxes with themed itemsKids love a good mystery and adore surprises, so use that emotional pull to your advantage by introducing a special “mystery” play box filled with themed goodies to inspire. For example, the box might include baby items such as bottles, rattles and blankets, for when kids want to play family. Or, fill it with safe medical supplies such as play bandages, thermometers and containers for aspiring front-line workers. Change out weekly or at the frequency of your choosing to always keep young minds guessing while fueling their creative tank.Integrate favorite characters into imaginative playIntroducing your child’s favorite characters into play time can help to keep them engaged, especially when they can include them in their own storytelling. One example is the BRIO Disney Mickey and Friends: Mickey Mouse Record &amp; Play Station, which allows children to craft their own travel story for Mickey as he rides around the wooden tracks. Using the ‘record-and-play’ function, kids can bring Mickey to life using their own voice and imagination to decide what he’s up to while on the road!Upcycle and craft cardboard creationsMany families are getting more deliveries right to their home and with that comes plentiful cardboard boxes. Recycling is always a great idea, but before you do so, consider upcycling opportunities for your kids. With some basic crafting supplies and a touch of imagination, a large cardboard box can be transformed into a treehouse, restaurant, island hut and more. Medium and small boxes can be turned into cars, doll houses and beds for toys. With each delivery comes a new opportunity to create, and when children are done playing, you can still recycle the cardboard to support the environment.The power of play has never been more important. By embracing each day and fostering new experiences through imaginative play, you’ll provide your kids with a much-needed escape with ample benefits."

            "body": "There are more connections between diabetes and cancer than you’d expect. Research suggests the two can be intimately related — with some cancer treatments putting patients at risk for insulin dependence, and type 2 diabetes greatly increasing a person’s susceptibility to cancer.Because cancer and both types 1 and 2 diabetes can weaken the immune system, people with these disorders are also at increased risk of of severe illness from COVID-19, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).[1]Cancer and diabetes are connectedIn type 1 diabetes, the body no longer sufficiently produces insulin. In type 2 diabetes, the body may still be producing insulin, but other metabolic cells of the body become resistant to its effects (insulin resistance). Insulin, a hormone the pancreas makes to allow cells to use glucose, remains the standard treatment option for millions of people living with diabetes.[2] In 1978 at City of Hope, a biomedical research complex and National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center in Southern California, Arthur Riggs, Ph.D., and Keiichi Itakura, Ph.D., conducted research that led to the invention of synthetic human insulin, which transformed modern diabetes management. In 2017, City of Hope founded the Wanek Family Project for Type 1 Diabetes, an ambitious program designed to rapidly translate laboratory discoveries into new treatments — and eventually a cure — for type 1 diabetes.Cancer and diabetes are “two sides of the same coin” because at a fundamental level both are disruptions of the body’s normal metabolism. For example, people with type 2 diabetes are twice as likely to develop liver or pancreatic cancer and run a higher-than-normal risk of developing colon, bladder and breast cancer. City of Hope’s Debbie C. Thurmond, Ph.D., explained that obesity is a major risk factor for both cancer and type 2 diabetes. “Excess fat may provoke the disruption of the body’s normal metabolism and increase inflammation, which is a known trigger for both diabetes and cancer,” she said.Diabetes and COVID-19 also appear to be connectedWhile there’s still much to learn about COVID-19, recent data from the CDC reported more than three-quarters of people who died from COVID-19 had at least one preexisting condition. Specifically, diabetes was noted as an underlying condition in approximately four out of 10 patients. Among people younger than 65 who died from the infection, about half had diabetes.[3]Managing diabetes during COVID-19People with diabetes — type 1 or type 2 — are more susceptible to contracting COVID-19 than others, and have poorer outcomes if they do. City of Hope’s Ping H. Wang, M.D., noted, “Patients with diabetes have higher risks of serious complications and ketoacidosis from COVID-19,” and explained that warning signs of severe infection are heightened shortness of breath, persistent chest pain and an intense feeling of fatigue. Even mild symptoms should not be ignored, he said. If you are experiencing any flu-like symptoms, Wang said you should call your physician and continue to monitor your blood glucose.Managing your diabetes as the first line of defense against the novel coronavirusIt’s critical that those battling cancer and/or type 1 or 2 diabetes stay informed and take necessary precautions, which may include:For more information on City of Hope’s Diabetes &amp; Metabolism Research Institute, clinical trials and innovative diabetes research, visit CityofHope.org/diabetes-awareness.[1] U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Because of their key nutrients, eggs were specifically mentioned as a crucial food source for pregnant women, infants and throughout the lifecycle in the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee's Scientific Report.This Advisory Committee of 20 nationally recognized health and medical experts reviewed the latest scientific evidence on nutrition and highlighted eggs as a vital first food for infants, due to the important role they play in a growing child's health. For pregnant women, choline helps to develop their baby's brain and spinal cord.In fact, approximately 90% of Americans don't get enough choline, an important nutrient for cognitive development and health. Eggs are one of the most concentrated food sources of choline in the American diet. One large egg contains 150 milligrams of choline — about 27% of the amount men need daily and 35% of the amount women need each day.Early egg introduction and allergiesThe Advisory Committee also shared a new recommendation based on up-to-date research. Early introduction of eggs — when a baby is 4-6 months old and developmentally ready to eat solid foods — may help reduce a child's risk of developing an allergy to eggs.Additionally, based on this report, caregivers provide a variety of foods for children including meat, poultry, seafood, eggs and dairy, along with fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and whole grain products beginning from 6-12 months old. The Advisory Committee specifically recommended eggs as an important first food for infants and toddlers as they are a rich source of choline and because early introduction of eggs (after 4 months of age), when baby is developmentally ready, may help reduce the risk of developing an egg allergy.How to introduce eggs into your baby's dietDean recommends keeping it simple. He has tried the following ways of feeding eggs to his young son:The recipe below is one that everyone in the family can enjoy. Banana, pumpkin and eggs come together to create a soft texture and sweet taste, making these pancakes perfect for babies and toddlers.Banana Pumpkin PancakesTotal time: 20 minutes; Servings: 4Ingredients:3 bananas (about 1 cup)1/2 cup pumpkin puree (about half of a 15-ounce can)4 large eggs1 teaspoon baking powderFresh fruit to serve with it, if desiredDirections:In blender, combine banana, pumpkin, eggs and baking powder. Blend until smooth.Spray nonstick skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium-low heat. Pour about 1 tablespoon of batter onto skillet and cook until golden brown, about 1-2 minutes.Carefully flip pancake and cook the other side until golden brown, about 1-2 minutes.Repeat with remaining batter.Refrigerate leftovers up to 3 days.Feeding your baby or toddler eggs not only provides them with crucial nutrients at an early age, but eggs are also quick to prepare and easy for infants and young children to eat.Looking for more recipes for your family using The Incredible Egg?

            "body": "Having seasonal allergies is a struggle all day, both in the spring and fall, but for many it's evening when problems intensify. Runny nose, sneezing, itching, tossing and turning disrupt your ability to rest. Fortunately, with a few simple lifestyle changes to help keep fall allergies at bay, so you can sleep well and wake rejuvenated.Step 1: Keep windows closedThe first step to a good night's rest starts long before evening by keeping windows closed. This helps limit outdoor allergens from reaching your bedroom and wreaking havoc on your ability to sleep. If you decide to open some windows in your home, keep bedroom doors and windows closed to help maintain allergen-free sleep spaces. Keep in mind, pollen counts are highest in the morning.Step 2: Quarantine the day's clothingThe clothes you wear during the day collect microscopic allergens like pollen and mold. Make it a habit to get undressed in a room other than your bedroom and place dirty clothes immediately in the laundry room. This way any allergens on clothing won't be shaken into the air in your bedroom where they can irritate you while sleeping.Step 3: Wash well before bedDuring allergy season consider changing your sleep routine to include an evening shower. This is one of the best ways to remove allergens from your body to help you sleep soundly. Additionally, the steam from the shower helps open and clear nasal passages so you can breathe easier. If you can't shower, make sure at minimum to wash your hands and face well before bed.Step 4: Take nighttime allergy medicineStep 5: Allergy-proof your bedMany people with allergies find allergy-proof mattress and pillow covers are a worthwhile investment. Remember to wash bedding weekly and use a dryer rather than placing items outside to dry. The Mayo Clinic recommends washing all sheets, blankets, pillowcases and bedcovers in hot water at least 130 degrees F to kill dust mites and remove allergens1. For items that can't be washed hot — such as decorative pillows and stuffed animals — place in the dryer for at least 15 minutes at 130 degrees F or higher.Step 6: Use pillows to raise the headCongestion often gets worse when you lay down to bed because gravity no longer helps mucus move through your system. To help encourage natural drainage, prop your head on a pillow. Some people even use two pillows when symptoms flair to help encourage drainage so they can breathe easier at night. Bonus: this might help prevent snoring as well.No one should sacrifice sleep due to their allergies. With these simple steps, you'll be ready to sleep well even when allergy season is in full effect.[1] Mayo Clinic, 2019, https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dust-mites/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352178"

Each person has their own struggles, and for children with critical illnesses, the added isolation can be overwhelming.Fortunately, even during these challenging times, Make-A-Wish® employees and volunteers are committed to granting every possible wish that is safe to complete, something only made possible by the continued support of generous donors and helpful organizations who believe in the hope and joy that a wish experience brings.Brooklyn’s leukemia battleBrooklyn, from the San Francisco Bay Area in California, was diagnosed with leukemia at age 2 in January 2020, right at the start of the pandemic. “It hit hard for our home, our family,” says Brooklyn’s mom, Brandi. “It is hard to grasp that a little girl that just started life was having this huge battle now.”While focused on fighting Brooklyn’s cancer, the family wanted to maintain as much normalcy for her as possible. Brooklyn is an active and social child, so that meant playing outside as much as possible, and she loved to visit local parks and playgrounds. Unfortunately, the escalating global pandemic and her ongoing cancer treatments made this impossible.“We knew that with COVID, we weren't going to be going out much anywhere due to the high risk,” says Brandi.Brooklyn's wish: A day of hope and joyBrooklyn desired to play outdoors and stay active just like any other young child, despite her cancer treatments. She wished for a play structure in her backyard so she could play freely and safely without the increased risk she’d encounter at public properties.Make-A-Wish began plans to make Brooklyn's wish come true but needed to overcome obstacles to bring Brooklyn the hope and joy she very much deserved. Unfortunately, at first COVID-19 shelter-in-place restrictions in the Bay Area prohibited construction projects like Brooklyn’s play structure. Eventually, staff were able to plan a safe and socially distanced construction plan. The play structure was ordered and delivered and volunteers, including staff members from Bristol Myers Squibb, a national corporate supporter of Make-A-Wish, were ready to put it together.Then, in the days before assembly was due to begin, major fires broke out across northern California, and the project had to be postponed once again, this time due to very unhealthy air quality. However, thanks to the persistence and flexibility of all involved, in September 2020, Brooklyn’s play structure was revealed and she now enjoys spending full afternoons playing outside.Support for wishesThe support of donors like you as well as generous partner organizations allows Make-A-Wish to continue to grant wishes, even during the complexities of the COVID-19 pandemic. Bristol Myers Squibb is one of these organizations, having donated more than $3.5 million since 2016, including a charitable donation of $500,000 in 2020.“We know the role hope can play in the treatment of children affected by critical illness and we continue to be inspired by Make-A-Wish and their mission of granting life-changing wishes that bring a renewed sense of energy and fight to pediatric patients and their families,” says Brent Pfeiffenberger, senior vice president, head of US Oncology, Bristol Myers Squibb.When a wish is granted, a child replaces fear with confidence, sadness with joy and anxiety with hope. “If you can find something fun for them, then they have something to look forward to after hard days. It is wonderful. It is priceless,' says Brandi.Despite the worldwide health crisis that COVID-19 has caused, Make-A-Wish continues to find creative ways to deliver ongoing hope and inspiration to wish kids who are waiting for their wish to come true. Even in these challenging times, staff and volunteers are committed to granting every possible wish that is safe to complete.

Fifty-seven percent of shoppers surveyed report that they are likely to change their gifting habits this holiday season because of COVID-19[1]. As a result, shoppers are relying on a long-time favorite — gift cards — as a gift that can lessen the headache of 2020. This year’s most requested gift allows consumers to shop online or load gifts into mobile wallets, making shopping simpler and safer.“Gift cards have been the most requested gift for fourteen years in a row[2],” said Megan Flanagan, executive director of the of the non-profit Retail Gift Card Association. “And they couldn’t be easier to buy. Most people are still visiting grocery stores during the pandemic, where you can find gift card malls that offer plenty of options for everyone on your list. Some grocers even offer curbside pickup of gift cards.”Most gift cards also come in digital form, called eGifts, which can be completely contactless: bought, given and spent digitally. However, physical gift cards can be spent online, too.“So, whether you give gift cards or eGifts, your recipients don’t have to worry about using them in person or shopping in crowded malls if they don’t want to,” continued Flanagan. “And, when your recipients get to buy what they want, where they want, they never have to worry about returning a gift they can’t use.”As gift cards continue to grow in popularity, and the social landscape is changing due to the pandemic, gift cards are increasingly being used to connect people through shared experiences, virtually.“With people spending more time at home, we’ve seen food delivery, streaming and gaming, and home improvement gift cards increasing in popularity,” said Shelley Hunter, the Gift Card Girlfriend at GiftCards.com and gifting expert. “Shoppers are looking for creative ways to celebrate, like choosing gift cards that create an at-home experience. For instance: a Grubhub gift card paired with a new jigsaw puzzle, or gaming and streaming gift cards given with a cozy blanket.”Another gift card trend this year is multi-store cards featuring an assortment of retailers, restaurants and entertainment options on a single card, giving recipients more freedom to choose where to spend their gift. Some popular options include:You can check out an array of holiday gift card options at the gift card mall in your local grocer or retailer, or online at GiftCards.com.[1] The “2020 BrandedPay™ Holiday Shopping Preview” report is based on the findings in the Holiday Gifting 2020 study, an internet-based survey conducted by Leger on behalf of Blackhawk Network between August 24–31, 2020.

Keeping track of the newest information about adequate nutrition is difficult enough, not to mention you're now dealing with toddler food preferences that can seemingly alter overnight.'Guidelines around nutrition are frequently changing and parents of young children often struggle with knowing what to feed their little ones and how to do it best,' says Dr. Christina Valentine, neonatologist focused on maternal and infant diet and North America Medical Director, RB Nutrition. 'This can lead to a lot of misconceptions that confuse well-meaning parents.'Toddlers' bodies and brains are growing rapidly, so it's important they have good nutrition to help support this growth. Valentine shares her expert insight about some of the most common food and nutrition myths, along with ways to help ensure your toddler is getting the necessary nutrients.Myth: Toddlers get enough vitamin D from the sun.Fact: Vitamin D is important for healthy bone growth in toddlers, yet many kids may be experiencing decreased exposure to sunlight due to changing seasons, differing routines, quarantine and more. This decreased exposure paired with limited dietary sources of vitamin D can mean some children may need additional supplementation, according to Pediatrics journal. In fact, the Journal of Nutrition reported that 76% of U.S. toddlers, aged 12 to 24 months, have an inadequate intake of vitamin D.What to do: If your child is no longer drinking formula, incorporate vitamin D-rich foods and drinks like fortified milk and yogurt, toddler nutritional drinks, eggs, canned tuna, salmon and a vitamin D fortified cereal into their diet.Myth: My child will eventually grow out of being a picky eater.Fact: As kids grow up, they may outgrow resistance with certain foods, however, some habits may stick around if not addressed.What to do: Try offering a variety of healthy options during snack time. Serve meals buffet style and allow your child to choose from a selection of nutritious foods, introducing new foods into the mix. Additionally, get them interested in what they’re eating by allowing them to help out in the kitchen. Finally, be a role model for healthy eating choices so they observe you eating well, too.Myth: All toddlers can get all the nutrients they need — like iron — from their diet.Fact: Because toddlers' tastes are changing, they might not be getting the necessary nutrients they need from their diet. Data show many toddlers face nutrient inadequacies and that approximately 1.5 million children between the ages of 1 and 5 may be at risk for iron deficiency, according to Nutrients journal.What to do: Mix in nutritious foods with foods you know they like such as peanut butter, yogurt and blended fruit smoothies. Consider incorporating a toddler nutritional drink, like Enfagrow Toddler Nutrition Drink, to help fill in those nutrient gaps. Made with real milk, it has nutrients like DHA, vitamin D and iron. In fact, two servings has 70% of the daily value of iron they need for development, and it helps support growth with as much iron as in over two gallons of milk. Serve it as a drink on-the-go or use it in baking."

            "body": "Newborns need a lot of sleep, but rarely does it seem like they are ever actually sleeping. Ask any parent and they will tell you that they spend far more time trying to put baby down to rest than the amount of time baby remains asleep! It’s a tale most parents are all too familiar with: the 3 am feedings, followed by hours of tossing and turning, and then, before they have a moment to shut their eyes, the next feeding. Welcome to the 3am Club.'Sleepless nights are difficult whether it's your first child or you've been around the baby block a few times before,' says Natalie Willes, expert baby sleep trainer. 'It's fundamentally important for both the parent and child to get adequate rest, yet this is often easier said than done. Fortunately, there are methods to help you succeed.'Willes recommends NUK's 3am Club as a useful resource for parents seeking support on how to manage restless nights. Whether parents need help soothing baby or are looking for advice on how to maximize their sleep, the site offers free tools and on-the-spot tips from experts to help newborns and parents get some much needed shut eye, including:Embrace sleep routinesHaving a solid sleep routine for baby can set the stage for a better night's rest. Participating in relaxing activities before bedtime such as a gentle bath, infant massage, soft music, calm reading and a quiet feeding in a dimly lit room, can help calm parents’ minds and soothe little ones to sleep. Just remember consistency counts, so try to stick to the same order and time for baby's routine each day. It’s also important for parents to set their own nighttime routine that helps them unwind and relax before bed, like taking a warm bath, reading or participating in a short meditation.Keep baby closeContrary to popular beliefs, having baby sleep in a separate room doesn’t actually help you get better sleep. In fact, many experts recommend sleeping in the same room as your baby until they are at least six months of age. This brings comfort and peace of mind to both the baby and parent, encouraging a deeper sleep for everyone. Plus, when baby wakes up, parents won’t need to run across the hall. Instead, they can simply tend to baby’s needs and then transition right back to sleep.Quiet the mindNew parent worries compounded with sleep deprivation can make it very difficult to quiet the mind and get deep, restorative sleep. When anxiety sets in or the mind starts to race, experts recommend tuning into your breathing with guided exercises and meditations, or listening to soothing music, or adult sleep stories. Through NUK’s partnership with the Breethe Meditation app, parents have free access to these resources and more, helping them calm their minds so they can get restful sleep.Consider nutritionMost times, parents are so in-tune with their infant’s nutrition that they unknowingly neglect their own. Not getting the right kind, or amount, of nutrition can greatly impact not only how parents wake up feeling, but also how well they sleep at night. To help sustain energy and beat fatigue, parents should avoid eating carb-heavy meals throughout the day and instead fill their plates with energy-sustaining foods such as eggs, yogurt, oatmeal, apples and nuts. A morning caffeine boost can also help, but stick to the American Academy of Pediatrics’ recommendation of less than three cups of coffee a day while breastfeeding.Stay positiveA positive outlook is so important during challenging times and that comes with giving yourself some grace. Understand that some days are going to be easier than others and the same is true for your infant. Reach out for help if needed, whether that be to a partner, friend or family member, and communicate any concerns you have with your doctor and baby's pediatrician. No two babies are alike, so it is important to practice new methods when you hit hurdles and know that a good night's rest is within reach."

            "body": "Regina Philipps’ son, Shane, was born a happy, healthy and strong baby — holding his head up on his own, rolling, and pushing himself up on his arms. But at six months old, Regina noticed something might be wrong.“He started moving less, and some of the strength he had seemed to be disappearing,” said Regina. “It was subtle at first — like when he stopped grabbing my hands and pulling himself up after I changed his diaper. He got to the point where he couldn’t really move his legs. When sitting, he would fall over. He could barely even lift his arms up to his mouth to eat.”Shane was diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) Type 2 — a progressive, rare genetic disease caused by the lack of a functional survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene.1 Each year, one in every 11,000 babies is born with the disease.2,3 SMA is the leading genetic cause of infant death.1 SMA progresses quickly, meaning the earliest possible diagnosis and treatment is crucial. If left untreated in one of its most severe forms, Type 1, children often require permanent feeding and breathing support or pass away by their second birthday.4 While on average, babies with SMA Type 2 are diagnosed between six and 24 months of age, Shane received his diagnosis at 10 months old and he received treatment soon after.Millions of babies across the country are routinely screened at birth for conditions that can affect a child’s long-term health or survival. In 2018, SMA was added to the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP), a federal list of often devastating disorders that require intervention as early as possible and have treatment options available.5 Despite the fact there are now treatments approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for SMA, only 33 states screen for SMA through permanent or pilot programs, leaving babies in 17 states, plus Washington, D.C., unscreened for this devastating disease.5,6“We live in New Jersey, which was supposed to implement newborn screening for SMA this August, but because of the COVID-19 pandemic, is implementing it next year. Although we wish we knew sooner, we feel very lucky that Shane’s symptoms were caught relatively early and before he declined even further, so we could pursue treatment as fast as possible,” Regina said. “For babies like Shane, early diagnosis can mean prevention of disease progression. For some babies — especially those with SMA Type 1 — early diagnosis can mean the difference between life and death. That’s why I’m so passionate about educating on the importance of newborn screening, advancing efforts in my state and sharing how people can get involved.'Children living in states with newborn screening in place can benefit from the remarkable difference early detection and treatment can make — an issue Rory and Carolyn Philstrom know firsthand. It wasn’t long before their son Edan was born that they moved from North Dakota to Minnesota, where Rory was due to start a new job. Because Minnesota actively conducts newborn screening for SMA, Edan’s pediatrician called five days after his birth to tell them his newborn screening test resulted in a positive diagnosis for SMA Type 1. They were blindsided by the diagnosis — but given how quickly SMA progresses, grateful that they could quickly work with their physician on a treatment plan — without losing the precious time they wouldn’t have benefited from in North Dakota. Without screening, children with SMA Type 1 typically receive a diagnosis anywhere up to 6 months after birth.“Just the sooner you get the diagnosis — the sooner you get that phone call — can make a difference. Even days can make a difference,” said Carolyn.Since Shane’s diagnosis, Regina has been an active member of the SMA community, helping to advocate for SMA to be added to her state’s newborn screening panel. Their efforts were successful and in January 2020, New Jersey passed a law to screen for SMA, which will be implemented in 2021. Other states have followed, including California, Illinois and Washington. By 2022, Regina, along with patients, caregivers, and the entire SMA community at large, are hopeful every newborn in the United States will be screened for this devastating disease.For more information about SMA and to inquire about what you can do to ensure that babies in your state are screened for this disease, visit CureSMA.org/ActionCenter.ReferencesUS-ZOL-20-050111/2020"

            "body": "Staying active is important during the COVID-19 pandemic, and for many people, that means pursuing outdoor activities where fresh air is plentiful and social distancing is easier to achieve. During winter months, that includes popular seasonal activities such as sledding, ice skating, skiing and more.While doctors applaud people for staying active and keeping safety measures in mind, they also are preparing for an uptick in injuries associated with these types of activities. Many winter outdoor activities may appear safer when it comes to spreading viruses. However, they still carry the inherent risk of physical injury, and it's important to take special precautions to protect yourself and family.Consider skiing and snowboarding, for example. Falls are common whether you're new or are experienced in these sports. Technique and safety gear can make a big difference.“Ski season is coming and ACL tears are common,' says orthopaedic surgeon and American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) spokesperson Jason Koh, MD, FAAOS. 'Research has shown that keeping your arms forward and hips over the knees can reduce the risk of injury. Many injuries occur from falling backwards and the knee twisting. Make sure your bindings are appropriately adjusted for your ability. For snowboarders, wrist injuries are common, and based on research I'd recommend wrist guards for protection.”According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), more than 119,625 skiing- and snowboarding-related injuries are treated in emergency departments, doctors’ offices and clinics annually. However, there are many other winter activities where it's important to be mindful of injury and take smart steps to stay safe. Annually, health care facilities treat more than 20,177 snowmobiling-related injuries, more than 23,110 sledding and tobogganing-related injuries, and more than 43,596 ice skating-related injuries.Before you head outdoors to enjoy your favorite winter activities, consider these smart safety tips from Dr. Koh and fellow bone and joint health experts at AAOS. For additional information, visit orthoinfo.org.Gear up: Always wear appropriate protective gear for whatever activity you're doing. This includes helmets, gloves, goggles and padding. Remember, for kids, gear from last year may not fit this year due to growth. Use new or updated gear that fits properly for the best protection.Choose proper footwear: Make sure footwear is the right size and fits properly. For sports like ice skating and skiing that require special footgear, rent or upgrade if options no longer fit or are damaged. For other outdoor activities, use high-quality winter boots with a non-slip base, such as a rubber sole. Wear long socks and keep insides of footwear dry.Wear layers: For warmth and protection when playing outside, wear several layers of light, water- and wind-resistant clothing. Layering allows you to accommodate your body's constantly changing temperature. Choose layers that aren't too tight or loose to help the body breathe while also retaining heat and blocking the wind.Warm up and stay aware: Before you head outdoors for any activity, warm up muscles with light exercise for 10 minutes. When outdoors, don't overdo activities and recognize when fatigue is setting in and you need to take a break or call it a day. Pushing yourself when your body is exhausted can increase risk of injury to yourself and others.Know and abide by the rules: Every winter sport has unique rules and even etiquette that often stem from safety concerns. If you're not sure, ask. Use all equipment as it's intended, and if you're new to an activity, consider taking a lesson that includes learning how to fall correctly to reduce the possibility of an injury. If taking a lesson, ensure to follow COVID-19 guidelines.Stay aware: Seek shelter and medical attention immediately if you or anyone with you is experiencing hypothermia or frostbite. Frostbite signs include numbness, skin that is waxy, or discolored skin that is yellow, gray or blue. Hypothermia signs include shivering, exhaustion, confusion and slurred speech. If you find yourself in an emergency, dial 911.'We want to share bone and joint safety information to help reduce the likelihood of falls and injuries, as well as provide general injury prevention tips to keep people healthy and enjoying the outdoors throughout winter,' says Dr. Koh. 'With a few proactive steps everyone can maximize winter without putting their musculoskeletal frames at risk.'"

            "html": "<p>Staying active is important during the COVID-19 pandemic, and for many people, that means pursuing outdoor activities where fresh air is plentiful and social distancing is easier to achieve. During winter months, that includes popular seasonal activities such as sledding, ice skating, skiing and more.</p><p>While doctors applaud people for staying active and keeping safety measures in mind, they also are preparing for an uptick in injuries associated with these types of activities. Many winter outdoor activities may appear safer when it comes to spreading viruses. However, they still carry the inherent risk of physical injury, and it's important to take special precautions to protect yourself and family.</p><p>Consider skiing and snowboarding, for example. Falls are common whether you're new or are experienced in these sports. Technique and safety gear can make a big difference.</p><p>“Ski season is coming and ACL tears are common,\" says orthopaedic surgeon and <a href=\"https://www.aaos.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons</a> (AAOS) spokesperson Jason Koh, MD, FAAOS. \"Research has shown that keeping your arms forward and hips over the knees can reduce the risk of injury. Many injuries occur from falling backwards and the knee twisting. Make sure your bindings are appropriately adjusted for your ability. For snowboarders, wrist injuries are common, and based on research I'd recommend wrist guards for protection.”</p><p>According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), more than 119,625 skiing- and snowboarding-related injuries are treated in emergency departments, doctors’ offices and clinics annually. However, there are many other winter activities where it's important to be mindful of injury and take smart steps to stay safe. Annually, health care facilities treat more than 20,177 snowmobiling-related injuries, more than 23,110 sledding and tobogganing-related injuries, and more than 43,596 ice skating-related injuries.</p><p>Before you head outdoors to enjoy your favorite winter activities, consider these smart safety tips from Dr. Koh and fellow bone and joint health experts at AAOS. For additional information, visit <a href=\"https://orthoinfo.org/en/staying-healthy/guidelines-for-preventing-falls/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">orthoinfo.org</a>.</p><p><strong>Gear up:</strong> Always wear appropriate protective gear for whatever activity you're doing. This includes helmets, gloves, goggles and padding. Remember, for kids, gear from last year may not fit this year due to growth. Use new or updated gear that fits properly for the best protection.</p><p><strong>Choose proper footwear:</strong> Make sure footwear is the right size and fits properly. For sports like ice skating and skiing that require special footgear, rent or upgrade if options no longer fit or are damaged. For other outdoor activities, use high-quality winter boots with a non-slip base, such as a rubber sole. Wear long socks and keep insides of footwear dry.</p><p><strong>Wear layers:</strong> For warmth and protection when playing outside, wear several layers of light, water- and wind-resistant clothing. Layering allows you to accommodate your body's constantly changing temperature. Choose layers that aren't too tight or loose to help the body breathe while also retaining heat and blocking the wind.</p><p><strong>Warm up and stay aware:</strong> Before you head outdoors for any activity, warm up muscles with light exercise for 10 minutes.

While swimming with other kids at school, he appeared to suddenly faint in the water. Fortunately, the swimming coach acted quickly. Although Noah's heart actually stopped beating, a local police officer happened to be in the school that day checking their emergency defibrillators, and an ambulance was sitting outside the school. Those circumstances helped prevent a tragedy for Noah and his family.Doctors and nurses at the hospital quickly recognized what was wrong with Noah — a condition called Long QT syndrome (LQTS), also referred to as “prolonged QT.” Long QT is caused by a genetic mutation which affects the heart rhythm, and it tends to run in families. Those who suffer from LQTS can have irregular heartbeats — prolonged and/or fast, chaotic heartbeats. This condition may trigger fainting, seizures, heart attacks and even sudden death.Since the incident in the pool that day, Noah has suffered from additional heart attacks, and underwent surgery to implant two defibrillators. Now 20 years old, he still suffers from critical side effects and receives lifesaving treatment at Children’s Heart Center at Strong in Rochester, New York. Due to his illness, he was enrolled in the Make-A-Wish program as a child — which recently surprised him with his wish by transforming his truck.When he’s not receiving treatments at the hospital, Noah enjoys creating music and studies automotive mechanics in hopes of becoming a trained mechanic. It was no surprise when Noah wished for a transformation to his truck. His fulfilled wish includes a lift, a grill, a sound system, rims and new tires.A car parade was organized with Noah’s family and friends to reveal his long-awaited truck makeover. Noah’s hero — the coach who pulled him from the pool — along with the police officer who was there that day when he nearly died at the age of 10, stood by for the reveal when Noah received keys to his revamped truck.Make-A-Wish is able to fulfill the wishes of children and teens suffering from critical illnesses every day, thanks to contributions from individuals and businesses nationwide. In East Aurora, New York, Noah’s truck transformation was made possible by Make-A-Wish Western New York and generous donations from Service Experts Heating &amp; Air Conditioning, one of the largest heating and air conditioning service companies, with 89 locations across 29 U.S. states and 3 Canadian provinces.Service Experts has been actively involved in fundraising efforts for the past two years to make a difference in the lives of children suffering from serious illnesses. As a team, they have hosted an array of creative fundraising efforts — ranging from company-wide Bowl-A-Thons, raffles and T-shirt sales to local events like dunking booths, yard sales and snack stores. Some team members have volunteered as wish granters to help kids identify their one true wish. Others have donated money and encouraged friends and family to do the same.For over two years, the company has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to support Make-A-Wish, and they proudly relate the stories of children they’ve helped on their website.'Our 3,600 employees play a significant role in our commitment to Make-A-Wish,' said Matt Kulik, general manager, Sunbeam Service Experts.

Because 2020 has been so stressful and challenging, a gift full of hope for the future can feel even more special. Consider ways to help further the education of your family and friends as you celebrate the holidays this year.Whether you’re brainstorming ideas for parents of teenagers who will soon be college bound, gifts for children still in school, or young adults making their way through secondary education or entering the workforce, the gift of education can be the most meaningful of all.Here are ways you can show you care about the students in your life — future, present and past.1. Help future students save for collegeGift of College holiday gift cards are an ideal gift for parents of young children who have just started saving up for college as well as for college-bound teens. As an investment in a college education without the burden of student loan debt, they are one of the most lasting gifts you can buy the children in your life.Cards are available online from Gift of College or at select retailers like Walmart.com and Target. Online card denominations range from $25 to $200. In-store denominations vary by retailer but most include $50 and $100 options. Every contribution adds to their college fund, and if you join forces with other family members or a group of friends to contribute, your gift will go even further.2. Help current students cover educational expensesFor high school students on the verge of graduation or those currently enrolled in higher education, there is no shortage of supplies, equipment, lessons and other experiences to help them along their educational journey.A subscription to educational enrichment services ranging from language-learning apps to online tutoring or test preparation can help promote their educational development. To support ongoing college expenses, helping students pay for textbooks is a very welcome gift. Some university bookstores offer gift cards, as do national chains that also sell new and used textbooks for college. Check with the student’s parents to find out what that student might need during the upcoming semester.3. Help former students pay down student debtEven if the college graduate in your life is done with school, they likely aren’t done paying for it. Help them get out from under the weight of student loan debt with a Gift of College gift card, which can also be used to pay off student loan accounts.'Everyone knows someone who needs the Gift of College, whether it's a child being educated virtually or a new graduate entering an uncertain workforce,” says Wayne Weber, founder and CEO, Gift of College. “As a proud uncle, I created Gift of College to ensure each and every individual is able to give the meaningful gift toward a debt-free future.

Others are creating entirely new online curricula for students who are learning from home. Many teachers are tasked with doing both at the same time, often without additional financial resources to make it all happen.A recent survey of 1,000 U.S. teachers by the education nonprofit DonorsChoose found that 42% of teachers were planning to teach in a hybrid format this fall, with students undergoing a combination of online learning and in-person learning. Thirty-five percent were set to teach entirely remotely, with 8% teaching in person and 14% unsure at survey time. Eighty-six percent of teachers reported feeling uncertain, anxious and overwhelmed as they prepared for the school year, and 81% expect that their schools will be forced to go online only at some point this school year.“I feel like waiting for answers is the hardest part,” notes one teacher who responded to the survey. “It is a wait-and-see with the health and safety of students, families and staff members always in the forefront.”In the survey, teachers also revealed the resources they most need.Teachers in the classroom: Cleaning supplies and PPEOf those teachers who returned to the classroom, 79% said they need cleaning supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE) to keep their students healthy and safe. In fact, DonorsChoose — which allows teachers to create requests for school resources that the public can help fund — has seen a surge in teacher requests for hand sanitizer, cleaning wipes and air filters. Teachers have also been quick to request basic supplies like glue, scissors, crayons and pencils, since 72% of teachers report their schools are no longer allowing students to share materials.Teachers online: Instructional technologyMany teachers began teaching online at the end of last school year. As school started this fall, 52% of teachers reported feeling more prepared to teach online than they did last spring, but there are still several challenges. The hardest part of teaching online, teachers report, is keeping students engaged. To do so, their greatest need is for instructional technology: laptops, tablets, document cameras and other technology to help them do demonstrations and keep their students interested in the content. Fifty-three percent of teachers also reported a greater need for technology for their students, so they can follow along at home.All teachers: Professional developmentFor experienced teachers, the lessons they’ve built and refined over years are being recreated to work for online or socially distanced learning. In the survey, 41% of teachers said the professional development they need most is for online instruction techniques; 20% were interested in learning more about online tools and technology to help them become stronger at remote teaching.All of these resource needs can add up quickly for teachers. “There will be a much greater need for classroom supplies as teachers have to change many things in their classrooms to keep materials, belongings and children separated,” said another teacher who responded to the survey. “This expense will fall on the teachers.”Since July, over 350,000 people have helped fund more than 110,000 teacher requests on DonorsChoose to help teachers to have a strong year, whether they’re teaching at home or in the classroom. Still, there are nearly 50,000 teacher requests awaiting support.To find a teacher request to support, visit www.donorschoose.org."

As parents navigate this new normal for their kids in sports, it’s more important than ever to support their kids' athletic pursuits while also keeping safety in mind.'In addition to performance, right now safety in youth sports is so important,' says author and sports nutrition expert Leslie Bonci, nutrition consultant for the Kansas City Chiefs. 'Parents want their children to thrive in athletics — whatever that might look like this year — but also want to keep their health and safety in mind, so it's important to take some proactive steps.'To help guide parents, Bonci shares her top tips for maintaining a safe and healthy lifestyle for your child no matter their athletic interest:Prioritize safety steps at home and awayAs kids come together in youth sports settings, health and safety are of the utmost importance. Remind them to always wash hands with soap and hot water for at least 20 seconds after using the restroom, blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing. They should also avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands. In sports settings, discourage sharing bottles, clean and sanitize them daily with water and liquid household chlorine bleach and eliminate any bulk food or beverages during practice and games, using individually packaged items instead. When they get home from practice, get them in the habit of washing hands again before settling in.Stay hydrated to fuel the body and focus the mindProper hydration is important both on and off the field of play. Rethink their drink and increase electrolyte intake with drinks such as Gatorade Juiced, a juice-based sports drink with a blend of fruit juices and electrolytes for hydration before, during and after physical exertion. It’s the only juice-based sports drink made with no added sugar, no artificial sweeteners or flavors, no colors from artificial sources and adequate electrolytes, as recommended by the Gatorade Sports Science Institute, to help replace what athletes lose in sweat.Create balanced plates and customized mealsA well-balanced diet is essential for growing athletes to maintain proper growth and optimize performance in athletic endeavors. Create a great plate by personalizing your child’s meals based on their individual needs and strategizing to ensure the quality and quantity of their food intake. An ideal diet comprises 45% to 65% carbohydrates, 10% to 30% protein and 25% to 35% fat. For example, brown rice topped with baked chicken breast and a side of roasted carrots would be a wholesome meal. A good dessert could be a vanilla yogurt parfait with berries and granola.Promote smart snack and drink choicesStock your fridge and pantry with wholesome choices for growing bodies so kids make smart choices even when you're not around. Cheese sticks and nut butters are excellent protein sources. Whole-grain crackers can provide a high-quality carbohydrate. Nuts and trail mixes are easy on-the-go options that satisfy hungry bellies. Fluids, like Gatorade Juiced, are very important for maintaining hydration and should be consumed before, during and after athletic events to help kids stay properly hydrated. Stock individual bottles and packages of snacks for easy access and to discourage sharing which can cause cross-contamination.'Things are certainly different now in youth sports, but that doesn't mean kids can't continue to do the things they love in mindful ways,' says Bonci. 'A few smart steps to support wellness can help your young athlete be the best no matter the environment.'"

            "body": "During a year that has been like no other, one thing is clear — family is more important than ever. Between the family members you’ve spent every moment with to those you dearly miss, the bonds between you are stronger than ever. What better way to celebrate your loved ones than to have a professional portrait taken?While everyone with a phone these days also has a camera, the truth is that the photos you may find social media-worthy are rarely good enough to hang on your wall or give to the grandparents. And taking a quality photograph of an entire family that you really want to frame and cherish for years to come? That’s nearly impossible to accomplish — unless you’re a professional photographer.Here are some reasons why hiring a professional photographer is the best choice for your next family portrait.1. Professional photographers are highly trainedProfessional photographers really understand how to use the tools of their trade, including how to compose a photograph, using the subtle art of lighting and optimal background settings to their best advantage. And Certified Professional Photographers must pass a rigorous exam and a Technical Image Evaluation by Professional Photographers of America (PPA). Not only do these tests demonstrate their strong technical abilities, but they also show that they have met a high standard of proficiency in photography. A PPA Certified Professional Photographer is especially skilled at capturing high-quality images under any condition.2. The pros understand how to bring the best out of your familyExperienced professional photographers are gifted at capturing the unique personalities and relationships of your family. Professionals are able to talk to family members, helping them feel relaxed and comfortable, whether they are very young children or reluctant teens. They know how to arrange the family group and create poses that are both natural and photogenic. They understand what will look great in a photograph and what will accurately capture the moment in time.3. A professional portrait creates a timeless family heirloomJust as you are unlikely to ask your cousin to snap your wedding pics with his smartphone, relying only on a family member’s skill with their phone's camera for a photo you want to keep forever is not a safe bet. Instead of relying on a smartphone and digital files alone, you can ask a professional photographer for a variety of print options — to create meaningful and treasured holiday gifts, suitable for family members near and far. A beautifully framed, stunning family portrait on the wall makes a wonderful statement. A masterful family photograph is a work of art that creates a striking focal point for any room. It captures a moment in time you will appreciate even more as your children — and grandchildren — grow and change over time. These images are keepsakes whose stories you'll tell time and time again, and will treasure forever.4. A photo session with a professional is a great experienceUsing a professional photographer is a memorable experience from beginning to end. Perhaps unlike your previous experiences trying to wrangle the family for an impromptu photo session run by you or your spouse, your family's session with a pro will be stress-free, because a professional photographer can help guide you throughout the process. From preparing for the session to wardrobe choices, backgrounds and other tips, you and your family won't have to worry. You can just relax and enjoy the process. You'll not only have the great photos to show for it, but also beautiful memories of a truly remarkable and unique experience with your family. 5. Professional photographers are business ownersWhen you hire a professional photographer, you know that you're getting someone who is willing to go the extra mile to deliver the best possible images. As business owners who thrive on customer service and satisfaction, professional photographers continuously aim to produce products that exceed customer expectations. When you hire a member of the Professional Photographers of America, you are ensuring that you’re hiring a photographer with substantial technical abilities. The investment in an experienced professional photographer is an investment in a high-quality family keepsake. Interested in finding a professional photographer in your area?

            "body": "The new school year is here — and it may look a little different. Teens are gearing up for more homework, more papers, and especially this year, more screen time. As of March 2020, teen use of apps and digital services is up 70% in the U.S.(1), and 70% of kids ages 12 to 15 get more than the recommended hours of screen time per day, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.With screen time ever-increasing, teens are exposed to more blue light, which are high-energy wavelengths emitted from the sun, LEDs, and digital devices such as smartphones, computers, and tablets. Overexposure to blue light can lead to difficulty falling asleep and inhibit the ability to reach REM sleep.To help reduce effects of blue light, here are some strategies to help find a better balance for your teen.Be a healthy-habit role modelParents have an important opportunity to be a positive influence when it comes to healthy behaviors. They learn from everything you say — and more importantly, what you do. Limiting your screen time is the most effective way of reducing blue light exposure, by limiting your own screen time you show your kids how to treat media as a privilege. Encourage time together as a family without screens or devices present.Supplement with vitamins and mineralsAs kids spend more time outdoors and in front of screens, it’s important to make sure they’re equipped with the right nutritional support. Alive! Teen Gummy Multivitamins are an excellent source of 16 vitamins and minerals, including vitamins A, C, D, and Lutemax 2020, to help eyes filter blue light produced by the sun, LEDs and electronic devices*.Set clear rulesTeens often lack the maturity to moderate screen time on their own. Establishing clear rules will provide structure and help your kids make better choices in the future. For example, try sticking to a rule of no screen time during the hour before bed and enforcing electronics-free meal times. This allows everyone the opportunity to sleep better and wake up refreshed — as well as more engaging family communication.Make time for physical activityGo for an evening walk. Play a game of catch. Find a sport the whole family enjoys. A little physical activity goes a long way. It provides time away from screens and numerous benefits for physical and social health.Remember: Pay attention to what’s on your kids’ screensBefore you let your teen buy a new video or computer game, do a little research, and find out what they are getting. Pay attention to ratings and try to limit them to games rated T (for teens) or younger. You can also use screening tools on TVs, computers, and tablets to block your teen’s access to inappropriate material.And remember, a productive conversation goes a long way. Be open with your teens and follow these tips to help them set screen time boundaries.(1): https://www.axios.com/kids-screen-time-coronavirus-562073f6-0638-47f2-8ea3-4f8781d6b31b.html*THESE STATEMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED BY THE FOOD &amp; DRUG ADMINISTRATION.

Although extensive travel, large group gatherings and many traditional activities can't happen, you can find imaginative ways to be just as joyful with a dash of creativity. In fact, many people are embracing this as an opportunity to discover new ways to make one-of-a-kind memories with family, friends and coworkers.Alternative approaches to work holiday partiesThe culmination of the work year is the annual holiday celebration. This is typically a time to enjoy great food, fun games and cheers to a job well done. However, with the pandemic causing many offices to go remote as well as restrictions for restaurants and group gatherings, this year will have celebrations of a different kind. Fortunately, technology is making many things possible.Employers want to show employees they care and are expected to shake things up in creative ways. This could include sending meals to everyone through home delivery and then meeting online to enjoy them together. This might be a video gathering for an ugly sweater contest paired with fun games that can be played digitally such as bingo and holiday trivia. Maybe it's hiring a live musician to play and everyone can sign in for a virtual happy hour while enjoying the customized tunes. How about karaoke?Online shopping expected to soarLast year, 56% of consumers reported they would make their holiday purchases online vs. at retail stores, according to the National Retail Federation. The experts at Purchasing Power — an employee purchase program — have witnessed this trend growing exponentially since March and expect at-home shopping to soar over the upcoming holidays. With so many people continuing to work or attend school at home, the most popular (and practical) gifts to be purchased and delivered right to people's doors include new laptops and home electronics, personal health and fitness equipment and ergonomic office furniture. Of course, toys, video games — there are many new products and gaming systems this year for kid and adult gamers — and small luxury items will still bring smiles to those longing for unexpected surprises during the holidays.With money being tight for many families this year, employers want to help by offering things like year-round financial programs that allow workers to purchase items without the stress or high-interest rates associated with credit cards. Ask your employer about voluntary benefits like Purchasing Power, which enables you to buy name-brand consumer products and services and pay over the course of a year through automated payroll deduction, with no interest, fees or required credit checks. Learn more at www.purchasingpower.com.Travel less, make more memories at homeWith airline travel at a minimum and health top of mind, many people won't be traveling to bake holiday treats and celebrate good tidings in person. Consider alternatives and plan a family video chat time to bake cookies together. Select and share a recipe ahead of time and then sign on to your digital device to talk with each other as you prepare dough, bake and enjoy treats. This might be the perfect time to tackle that traditional family recipe that's been handed down for generations and see who proves most successful.For younger children with shorter attention spans, you may just want to plan a virtual cookie or cupcake decorating party. Or perhaps you get crafty and make some hand-cut snowflakes or colorful paper garlands. As you add the perfect touches to holiday treats, exchange memories of holidays past and even pull out old family photo albums or videos to reminisce, make sure to enjoy a few treats together and take video stills to capture these special moments for future celebrations. Finally, wrap the fun up by reading a traditional holiday book to little ones before bedtime.The 2020 holiday season is sure to be unique, but 'different' can still be good. With an optimistic mindset and clever ideas, you'll put a new spin on family and workplace traditions and make some lasting memories."

Learn more at <a href=\"http://www.purchasingpower.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.purchasingpower.com</a>.</p><p><strong>Travel less, make more memories at home</strong></p><p>With airline travel at a minimum and health top of mind, many people won't be traveling to bake holiday treats and celebrate good tidings in person. Consider alternatives and plan a family video chat time to bake cookies together. Select and share a recipe ahead of time and then sign on to your digital device to talk with each other as you prepare dough, bake and enjoy treats. This might be the perfect time to tackle that traditional family recipe that's been handed down for generations and see who proves most successful.</p><p>For younger children with shorter attention spans, you may just want to plan a virtual cookie or cupcake decorating party. Or perhaps you get crafty and make some hand-cut snowflakes or colorful paper garlands. As you add the perfect touches to holiday treats, exchange memories of holidays past and even pull out old family photo albums or videos to reminisce, make sure to enjoy a few treats together and take video stills to capture these special moments for future celebrations. Finally, wrap the fun up by reading a traditional holiday book to little ones before bedtime.</p><p>The 2020 holiday season is sure to be unique, but \"different\" can still be good. With an optimistic mindset and clever ideas, you'll put a new spin on family and workplace traditions and make some lasting memories.</p>",

            "body": "Need someone to hug? They’re there. Need a workout buddy? They jump at the chance. Need a sympathetic ear? They keep all our secrets. If we learned anything this year, it’s that dogs are invaluable. And while many people added a furry family member to their home in 2020, there are still millions of homeless dogs looking to share their love. Sadly, these deserving animals are often perceived as ‘damaged goods’ just because of their appearance. To better their chances at finding a fur-ever family, pet industry leaders Wahl and Greater Good Charities have teamed up to donate funds and grooming supplies to shelters nationwide. The goal: transform thousands of dogs so their lovable, adoptable personalities can shine through. Hundreds of these amazing makeovers can be seen in the Dirty Dogs Before &amp; After Photo Gallery (DirtyDogsGallery.com) — including the following Top 10 Shelter Dog Makeovers of 2020.1. Winston’s story did not begin as a happy one. The loyal pup was kicked out of his home, but kept returning only to be rejected again and again. Alone and with nowhere to go, thankfully, a good Samaritan took pity on Winston and brought him to a rescue. After grooming and vet care, Winston went to a foster family for some added TLC. The foster family immediately cherished Winston, and weren’t about to let him leave. He’s now sharing his love with people who appreciate it.2. Chloe was rescued from a high kill shelter. Her fur was so severely matted she could barely see through the hair covering her eyes. After hours of careful grooming, most of her matted coat came off in one piece. What emerged was a pretty pup ready to rock a photoshoot. She now lives with a loving forever family that gives her the pampering she deserves.3. Patterson came to his rescue with a jaw that was broken in several places. For weeks, he wore a soft muzzle that left his skin irritated and his fur matted. His first grooming was a delicate process, but Patterson was a trooper and everyone was amazed by his adorable makeover. He now lives with a loving forever family, and they don’t care one smidge that he’s a bit of a messy eater.4. Buddy had a great start to life, and was a loving playmate to a little girl. Unfortunately, as the little girl got older Buddy went from playing tea party to being tied up outside every day. His owners finally decided he deserved better and turned him over to a rescue where he could get nutritious food, medical care and grooming. Buddy’s life is great once more, as an elderly gentleman adopted him and they are now best friends.5. Toko was turned over to his rescue in a rabbit cage, after years of neglect. He could hardly walk because of horrible mats that would pull on his red and raw skin. While he needed the relief of a good grooming, he was scared to let anyone touch him. Thankfully, a dedicated groomer worked wonders and Toko instantly became a different dog running and playing around the shop. In fact, his new bubbly personality won the heart of a grooming employee. He’s now spoiled with treats, cuddles — and baths.6. Barbie and her beau Ken were brought into the shelter as strays. Both were matted and dirty, but poor Ken also had a severe leg injury that required amputation. While recovering from surgery, Ken refused to eat without his true love by his side. Once reunited, these freshly groomed and healthier dogs became a true golden couple. Thankfully, they were adopted together and now live in a happy home where Barbie calls the shots.7. Truman’s harrowing rescue saved him from a criminal abuse case. He was so badly neglected that his coat was a shell of matted fur and feces, and he couldn’t move without being in extreme pain. After shaving off nearly five pounds of fur, Truman had to regain the use of his legs. Thankfully, however, it wasn’t long before he was running and playing again. Truman’s new family is now spoiling him overtime, as they’re determined to give him a future far brighter than his dark past.8. Stein’s original owners bought him from a breeder as a puppy, but soon decided they didn’t have time for him. Stein spent much of his life alone and outside until his owners agreed to surrender him. Once rescued, and after some medical care and a grooming makeover, Stein flourished. This handsome dog is no longer alone and lives with a family that loves him.9. Scruffy was found along the side of a road by a passing driver, who then called the rescue organization. On the phone, the driver said Scruffy was matted, but no one was prepared for the extent of his neglect. Under his shell of fur, groomers found a harness, sticks and other debris. Once cleaned up, his transformation into a handsome little guy with a big heart was truly remarkable. Scruffy no longer looks like his name, and his new mom thinks the world revolves around him.10. Florence was only six months old when she was rescued from a rural shelter that couldn’t care for her. The beginning of her life was harsh, as she suffered from untreated and painful mange. With some medical treatment and a foster family that nursed her back to health, Florence’s skin slowly healed and her beautiful fur grew back. Her transformation was on the inside too, as she went from being shy and scared to loving and playful. For Florence’s new mom, it was love at first sight.For more information on Wahl’s complete line of grooming products, including tips on how to pamper your own pooch, visit WahlUSA.com, or follow @WahlPets on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter."

            "body": "Si tiene ciertas afecciones crónicas, como enfermedad cardiaca, diabetes o asma, usted está en mayor riesgo de presentar complicaciones graves por la influenza, como neumonía, bronquitis u otras enfermedades que pueden causar hospitalizaciones, o incluso la muerte Aunque su afección crónica esté bien controlada, la influenza puede empeorarla, ya que puede desencadenar ataques de asma, aumentar el riesgo de presentar enfermedad cardiaca y accidente cerebrovascular, y hacer que el nivel de azúcar en la sangre sea más difícil de manejar. Se recomienda la vacunación contra la influenza para protegerlo contra enfermedades relacionadas con la influenza y para ayudarlo a mantener bajo control su afección crónica. Cada año, la influenza es responsable de millones de casos de enfermedad, decenas de miles de hospitalizaciones y miles de muertes. Durante la temporada de influenza pasada, 9 de cada 10 adultos hospitalizados por la enfermedad tenían por lo menos una afección subyacente reportada. Las más frecuentes afecciones subyacentes reportadas en pacientes hospitalizados por influenza incluyen enfermedad cardiaca, diabetes, obesidad y enfermedad pulmonar crónica. La vacuna contra la influenza reduce su riesgo de contraer la enfermedad, pero aunque la vacuna no prevenga completamente una infección por influenza, algunos estudios muestran que puede ayudar a reducir la gravedad de la enfermedad y prevenir complicaciones que pueden causar hospitalizaciones y la muerte. Vacunarse contra la influenza es siempre sumamente importante para las personas con ciertas afecciones crónicas, pero en estos momentos en que los EE. UU. combaten la pandemia del COVID-19, es más importante que nunca. La combinación de influenza y COVID-19 podría abrumar nuestros sistemas médicos. La vacuna contra la influenza esta temporada puede ayudar a protegerlo contra la enfermedad y reducir el riesgo de que necesite atención médica por complicaciones relacionadas con la influenza. Todos podemos poner de nuestra parte para reducir la propagación de la influenza y proteger a nuestros seres queridos y a nuestra comunidad contra la enfermedad, y así reservar los recursos médicos para el cuidado de los pacientes con COVID-19. Todavía hay tiempo para vacunarse contra la influenza. 'La actividad de la influenza todavía es baja ahora, lo cual significa que es un buen momento para vacunarse', dijo el Dr. Dan Jernigan, director de la División de Influenza de los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades. 'No sabemos qué nos traerá esta temporada, pero sabemos que la vacuna contra la influenza puede reducir el riesgo causado por la enfermedad. Parte de nuestra estrategia de preparación este invierno es sacar la influenza de la ecuación lo más posible. Vacunarse contra la influenza puede ayudar a hacerlo, para que haya una cosa menos de la que preocuparse', agregó. En los Estados Unidos, se han aplicado cientos de millones de vacunas contra la influenza de manera segura durante décadas. Hay datos que muestran que ponerse la vacuna contra la influenza es la mejor manera de protegerse contra la enfermedad. Reduzca su riesgo de contraer la influenza esta temporada. Póngase la vacuna ahora para protegerse a sí mismo, a sus seres queridos y a su comunidad contra la influenza. Todos podemos combatir la influenza. Haga que sea su prioridad hoy, consulte https://espanol.cdc.gov/flu para encontrar un sitio de vacunaciones cerca de usted."

Se recomienda la vacunación contra la influenza para protegerlo contra enfermedades relacionadas con la influenza y para ayudarlo a mantener bajo control su afección crónica. </p><p>Cada año, la influenza es responsable de millones de casos de enfermedad, decenas de miles de hospitalizaciones y miles de muertes. Durante la temporada de influenza pasada, 9 de cada 10 adultos hospitalizados por la enfermedad tenían por lo menos una afección subyacente reportada. Las más frecuentes afecciones subyacentes reportadas en pacientes hospitalizados por influenza incluyen enfermedad cardiaca, diabetes, obesidad y enfermedad pulmonar crónica. La vacuna contra la influenza reduce su riesgo de contraer la enfermedad, pero aunque la vacuna no prevenga completamente una infección por influenza, algunos estudios muestran que puede ayudar a reducir la gravedad de la enfermedad y prevenir complicaciones que pueden causar hospitalizaciones y la muerte. </p><p>Vacunarse contra la influenza es siempre sumamente importante para las personas con ciertas afecciones crónicas, pero en estos momentos en que los EE. UU. combaten la pandemia del COVID-19, es más importante que nunca. La combinación de influenza y COVID-19 podría abrumar nuestros sistemas médicos. La vacuna contra la influenza esta temporada puede ayudar a protegerlo contra la enfermedad y reducir el riesgo de que necesite atención médica por complicaciones relacionadas con la influenza. Todos podemos poner de nuestra parte para reducir la propagación de la influenza y proteger a nuestros seres queridos y a nuestra comunidad contra la enfermedad, y así reservar los recursos médicos para el cuidado de los pacientes con COVID-19. </p><p>Todavía hay tiempo para vacunarse contra la influenza. \"La actividad de la influenza todavía es baja ahora, lo cual significa que es un buen momento para vacunarse\", dijo el Dr. Dan Jernigan, director de la División de Influenza de los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades. \"No sabemos qué nos traerá esta temporada, pero sabemos que la vacuna contra la influenza puede reducir el riesgo causado por la enfermedad. Parte de nuestra estrategia de preparación este invierno es sacar la influenza de la ecuación lo más posible. Vacunarse contra la influenza puede ayudar a hacerlo, para que haya una cosa menos de la que preocuparse\", agregó. En los Estados Unidos, se han aplicado cientos de millones de vacunas contra la influenza de manera segura durante décadas. Hay datos que muestran que ponerse la vacuna contra la influenza es la mejor manera de protegerse contra la enfermedad. </p><p>Reduzca su riesgo de contraer la influenza esta temporada. Póngase la vacuna ahora para protegerse a sí mismo, a sus seres queridos y a su comunidad contra la influenza. Todos podemos combatir la influenza.

Como la propagación del virus no da señales de desaparecer, hemos comenzado a viajar de nuevo, pero de formas que priorizan la salud y el bienestar físico. Esto ha dado paso a algunas tendencias interesantes de viaje, demostrando que el amor de los estadounidenses de desplazarse a otros destinos sigue vibrante, pero un poco diferente a otros tiempos.Estas son las principales tendencias de viaje durante la pandemia de la COVID-19:Vacaciones más cortas, incluyendo viajes por carretera En la medida vamos aventurándonos cautelosamente a viajar, muchas personas optan por dejar a un lado las vacaciones de una semana y favorecer desplazamientos más cortos. De hecho, según una encuesta reciente realizada por Tripadvisor, el 55% de los viajeros en otoño del 2020 están reservando de dos a cinco noches cuando vacacionan, mientras que el 36% reservan estancias de una noche.La preocupación y los gastos vinculados al viaje por avión han hecho que otros tantos se decidan por destinos a los que puedan llegar manejando sus automóviles desde casa. El viaje tradicional por carretera está experimentando un resurgimiento, pues los viajeros prefieren usar sus vehículos para disfrutar la trayectoria a aventuras cercanas, ya sea en el campo o en una zona metropolitana, o cualquier opción intermedia.Espacio adicional para diversión, y distanciamiento social La posibilidad de dispersarse y estar distantes físicamente de otras personas mientras se disfruta en familia es una tendencia notable. Los vacacionistas están buscando destinos con amplitud para divertirse y espacio de juegos, tanto bajo techo como al aire libre. Esto puede abarcar desde alquilar una cabaña y practicar el senderismo, o reservar una habitación en un resort de grandes dimensiones con amplitud para no estar incómodamente cerca de otros huéspedes.Kalahari cuenta con cuatro ubicaciones idóneas para satisfacer estas necesidades, con un nuevo centro en Round Rock, Texas, conocido como el resort y parque acuático bajo techo más grande de los Estados Unidos, con 1.5 millones de pies cuadrados de espacio para jugar, lo cual equivale a numerosas oportunidades de diversión priorizando el distanciamiento social y la seguridad. Como los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC) no han encontrado evidencias de que la COVID-19 se transmita en aguas recreativas, disfrutar los 223,000 pies cuadrados de parque acuático bajo techo, conformado por 20 piscinas, 30 toboganes y 3 acres (1.21 hectáreas) de piscinas al aire libre.Más procedimientos de seguridad La seguridad, prioridad para todos los viajeros, es esencial. Muchos destinos y resort están cuidando al máximo la seguridad de sus huéspedes con nuevos procedimientos, como métodos de pago sin contacto y sin dinero en efectivo, ofreciendo check-in remoto e implementando una persona encargada del bienestar de los huéspedes para supervisar y comunicarles iniciativas de seguridad.Haga una búsqueda de ofertas en diferentes hoteles y elija aquel con el que se sienta más cómodo. Pregunte por la opción de abstenerse del servicio de limpieza durante su estancia si prefiere que nadie entre en su habitación, pero con la posibilidad de que le dejen toallas limpias y artículos de aseo de forma segura junto a la puerta para su conveniencia.Las experiencias y actividades son prioritariasCuarentena, permanencia en casa, trabajo a distancia y aprendizaje virtual: como hemos estado tanto tiempo en casa, al ir de viaje queremos priorizar experiencias únicas para crear recuerdos familiares significativos. Debido a que numerosas salas de cine y teatros, centros deportivos y atracciones turísticas siguen cerradas, el público busca destinos que ofrezcan experiencias integrales bajo un mismo techo con diversión para toda la familia.Kalahari Resorts es un gran ejemplo de esta experiencia exclusiva, con actividades para niños y adultos, opciones gastronómicas ideales para todos, y abundante espacio para jugar y relajarse. Desde toboganes acuáticos y simuladores de oleaje y de tiro, y circuitos de cuerdas, usted tendrá acceso a toda la diversión que sea capaz de disfrutar sin tener que salir del resort. Además, los padres se benefician con servicios de spa de clase mundial y también un bar acuático solo para adultos.Soñar y proyectar para el futuro Algunas personas no se sienten cómodas con irse de vacaciones, razón por la cual soñar con el futuro y planificar los viajes es la tendencia notable final durante la pandemia. Este tiempo adicional de que dispone ahora es ideal para investigar sobre nuevos destinos, conocer oportunidades exclusivas y buscar descuentos que le ayuden a ahorrar con reservaciones anticipadas.

De hecho, varias investigaciones revelan que las pequeñas empresas de propiedad de personas negras, indígenas y de color (también conocidas como de propiedad BIPOC, por las siglas en inglés que definen a este grupo), entre ellas la comunidad Latinx, han sido golpeadas con más severidad que otras, y muchas están luchando por la supervivencia.La Oficina Nacional de Investigaciones Económicas informó que entre febrero y abril de 2020, el índice de empresas activas de propiedad afroamericana disminuyó en un 41%; las empresas propiedad de Latinx (personas de ascendencia latinoamericana que no quieren ser definidas por su género) en un 32%; y las de propiedad asiática en un 25%.

            "body": "En 2020, la frase “distanciamiento social” se generalizó a nivel mundial, ya que muchas personas en todo el mundo tuvieron que pasar períodos de cuarentena prolongados. El mandato de mantener la distancia entre las personas, limitar los viajes y quedarse en casa ha dejado a muchas personas ansiosas, aisladas y solitarias. Desafortunadamente, para los 30 millones de estadounidenses que sufren de vejiga hiperactiva (VH), estos sentimientos son todos muy conocidos.[i]La VH es una afección definida por una necesidad repentina de orinar que puede ser difícil de ignorar o controlar, donde las personas experimentan más de ocho veces al día esa “necesidad de vaciar la vejiga” y con frecuencia se despiertan dos o más veces por la noche.[ii] Más allá de los síntomas físicos, las personas con VH también informan un deterioro significativo en la calidad de vida, esta condición limita la participación en algunos eventos diarios, la actividad física, la salud mental, el funcionamiento sexual, las relaciones interpersonales y el bienestar emocional.[iii] Las personas afectadas por VH a menudo sufren en silencio, ya que su condición no es bien comprendida o no es tratada de manera adecuada.[iii]La investigación etnográfica[iv] de Urovant Sciences reveló algunos resultados inesperados del COVID-19 en pacientes con VH.1. El alivio del distanciamiento social Para algunos, el COVID-19 les ha otorgado un refugio seguro. Vivir con VH puede significar viajes inesperados y urgentes al baño, lo que hace que algunas personas eviten los eventos sociales por completo. Algunas personas dicen que se sienten más relajadas en casa con un baño disponible a solo unos pasos de distancia.Vanessa, una vendedora que ha vivido con VH durante más de 20 años, dice que poder trabajar desde casa le ha permitido seguir con su rutina diaria con un menor nivel de estrés asociado a su condición. “La VH siempre ha hecho que las cosas más pequeñas —como ir al supermercado o ir al cine— sean más desafiantes. Me aísla cuando estoy en público o en un viaje de trabajo y lo único que tengo en mi cabeza es que llegue pronto la hora del receso para poder ir al baño. Pasar más tiempo en casa durante la pandemia ha sido un alivio. No necesito planificar mis rutas en torno a mi horario de uso del baño o arriesgarme a sentirme avergonzada frente a los demás”.2. La diferencia que marca una espera de cinco minutos Muchas tiendas y restaurantes tienen nuevos protocolos de seguridad en respuesta al COVID para mantener la limpieza. Sin embargo, algo tan pequeño como un retraso de cinco minutos podría arruinarle el día entero a una persona con VH. Cada minuto extra de espera en las filas, en los pasillos de dirección única o de búsqueda de un baño disponible puede marcar la diferencia entre llegar a casa o experimentar un escape involuntario de orina.“El COVID ha hecho que la vida con VH sea aún más complicada, y las tareas cotidianas se sientan a veces imposibles”, manifestó Sia, otra mujer con VH. “Con todos los restaurantes en mi área cerrados, hubo ocasiones en que quedé sin opciones si tuviese que usar el baño fuera de casa. Tuve que comenzar a planificar mis trámites con anticipación e incluso llamar a las tiendas antes de trazar mi ruta en torno a la disponibilidad de baños. Mi VH está constantemente en mi mente”.3. El médico ahora la puede atender por videollamadaDurante el tiempo en cuarentena muchas se han dedicado a proyectos que de otro modo habrían postergado: desde la organización del hogar hasta la repostería. Este también puede ser un momento ideal para construir una relación más sólida con su médico, especialmente para las mujeres que han pospuesto las visitas a su proveedor. Aunque más del 40 por ciento de las mujeres en los Estados Unidos viven con síntomas de VH, muchas personas postergan la búsqueda de tratamiento o incluso la conversación sobre sus síntomas con los proveedores de atención médica porque creen que su problema no es muy importante. iiiLa telemedicina, o visitas virtuales al consultorio médico, iban en constante aumento antes de dar un gran salto en popularidad debido a las preocupaciones por el COVID-19. Ahora, la telemedicina también puede ayudar a eliminar los obstáculos en el cuidado de la salud. Los pacientes no tienen que esperar en persona en los consultorios médicos con una mascarilla, trazar un mapa para identificar el baño más cercano o preocuparse por un largo viaje en automóvil hasta el consultorio del médico. Algunas personas también pueden sentirse más cómodas teniendo estas conversaciones desde la comodidad de su hogar.Todo esto puede originar mejores resultados para los pacientes: cuando un proveedor de atención médica entiende mejor los estilos de vida y las necesidades de sus pacientes, puede personalizar mejor sus recomendaciones de tratamiento y el manejo de los síntomas. Hablar con un proveedor del cuidado de la salud sobre la VH puede mejorar la comprensión de la condición, mantener a los pacientes actualizados sobre las últimas opciones de tratamiento y facilitar la exploración de las opciones que pueden funcionar mejor para usted. Ya sea de forma virtual o en persona (siguiendo los protocolos de seguridad), haga de su salud una prioridad.Para ayudar a abordar las necesidades de las mujeres que luchan con la VH y reducir el estigma que a menudo se asocia con esta condición, Urovant creó Bladder Chatter: un foro en línea basado en la comunidad que ayuda a empoderar, informar y apoyar a las mujeres con vejiga hiperactiva. El sitio está orientado a personas que buscan aprender unas de otras en un lugar seguro, privado y sin prejuicios. Bladder Chatter contiene artículos de expertos, consejos e historias de pacientes que instan a las personas con VH a cambiar la forma en que piensan sobre su condición.“Probé innumerables estrategias para manejar mi VH y, a veces, siento que esto es algo con lo que tengo que vivir”, indicó Vanessa. “En este momento, ni siquiera hablo de la VH con mi familia, solo lo hago con una amiga que tiene las mismas experiencias.

            "html": "<p>En 2020, la frase “distanciamiento social” se generalizó a nivel mundial, ya que muchas personas en todo el mundo tuvieron que pasar períodos de cuarentena prolongados. El mandato de mantener la distancia entre las personas, limitar los viajes y quedarse en casa ha dejado a muchas personas ansiosas, aisladas y solitarias. Desafortunadamente, para los 30 millones de estadounidenses que sufren de vejiga hiperactiva (VH), estos sentimientos son todos muy conocidos.<a href=\"#_edn1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><sup>[i]</sup></a></p><p>La VH es una afección definida por una necesidad repentina de orinar que puede ser difícil de ignorar o controlar, donde las personas experimentan más de ocho veces al día esa “necesidad de vaciar la vejiga” y con frecuencia se despiertan dos o más veces por la noche.<a href=\"#_edn2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><sup>[ii]</sup></a> Más allá de los síntomas físicos, las personas con VH también informan un deterioro significativo en la calidad de vida, esta condición limita la participación en algunos eventos diarios, la actividad física, la salud mental, el funcionamiento sexual, las relaciones interpersonales y el bienestar emocional.<a href=\"#_edn3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><sup>[iii]</sup></a> Las personas afectadas por VH a menudo sufren en silencio, ya que su condición no es bien comprendida o no es tratada de manera adecuada.<a href=\"#_edn3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><sup>[iii]</sup></a></p><p>La investigación etnográfica<a href=\"#_edn4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><sup>[iv]</sup></a> de Urovant Sciences reveló algunos resultados inesperados del COVID-19 en pacientes con VH.</p><p><strong>1. El alivio del distanciamiento social </strong></p><p>Para algunos, el COVID-19 les ha otorgado un refugio seguro. Vivir con VH puede significar viajes inesperados y urgentes al baño, lo que hace que algunas personas eviten los eventos sociales por completo. Algunas personas dicen que se sienten más relajadas en casa con un baño disponible a solo unos pasos de distancia.</p><p>Vanessa, una vendedora que ha vivido con VH durante más de 20 años, dice que poder trabajar desde casa le ha permitido seguir con su rutina diaria con un menor nivel de estrés asociado a su condición. “La VH siempre ha hecho que las cosas más pequeñas —como ir al supermercado o ir al cine— sean más desafiantes. Me aísla cuando estoy en público o en un viaje de trabajo y lo único que tengo en mi cabeza es que llegue pronto la hora del receso para poder ir al baño. Pasar más tiempo en casa durante la pandemia ha sido un alivio. No necesito planificar mis rutas en torno a mi horario de uso del baño o arriesgarme a sentirme avergonzada frente a los demás”.</p><p><strong>2.

Además, estar actualizado con respecto a la información más reciente sobre la nutrición adecuada es bastante difícil, y súmale a lo anterior que ahora está tratando con preferencias de alimentos para niños pequeños que pueden cambiar de la noche a la mañana.“Las normas o directrices en torno a la nutrición cambian frecuentemente, y los padres de niños pequeños confrontan a menudo dificultades a la hora de saber con qué deben alimentar a sus pequeños, y cómo hacerlo mejor”, explica la Dra. Christina Valentine, neonatóloga especializada en dieta materna e infantil, y Directora Médica de RB Nutrition para América del Norte. “Esto puede generar muchos conceptos erróneos que confunden a los padres bien intencionados”.Como los cuerpos y cerebros de los niños pequeños crecen rápidamente, es importante que tengan una buena nutrición para respaldar ese crecimiento. La Dra. Valentine nos ofrece su visión de experta sobre algunos de los mitos alimenticios y nutricionales más comunes, así como maneras de garantizar que tu niño pequeño esté recibiendo los nutrientes necesarios.El Mito: El Sol tiene vitamina D suficiente para los niños pequeños. La Verdad: Si bien la vitamina D es importante para el crecimiento óseo saludable en los niños pequeños, muchos de ellos pueden estar experimentando una menor exposición a la luz solar debido a las estaciones cambiantes, rutinas diferentes, cuarentena y otras situaciones. Según la publicación médica Pediatrics, esta exposición insuficiente, conjuntamente con fuentes dietéticas limitadas de vitamina D, puede equivaler a que algunos niños puedan necesitar suplementos adicionales. A propósito de ello, otra publicación especializada, Journal of Nutrition, informó que en los Estados Unidos, el 76% de los niños pequeños de 12 a 24 meses de edad experimentan una ingesta inadecuada de vitamina D.Qué hacer: Si tu hijo ya no consume fórmula para bebés, incorpora a su dieta alimentos y bebidas ricos en vitamina D como leche fortificada y yogur, bebidas nutricionales para niños pequeños, así como huevos, atún enlatado, salmón y cereal fortificado con vitamina D.El Mito: Con el tiempo, mi niño pequeño dejará de ser melindroso con la comida.La Verdad: A medida que los niños pequeños crecen, pueden superar el rechazo a ciertos alimentos. Sin embargo, algunos hábitos indebidos pudieran perdurar si no se corrigen a tiempo.Qué hacer: Trata de ofrecerle una variedad de opciones saludables en las meriendas. Sirve comidas estilo buffet y deja que tu niño elija entre una selección de alimentos nutritivos, incorporando otros nuevos a la combinación. Además, despiértale el interés en lo que está comiendo, permitiéndole ayudar en la cocina. Por último, sé un modelo para seguir con respecto a las opciones de alimentación saludable para que vean que tú también consumes alimentos saludables.El Mito: Los niños pequeños obtienen en sus dietas todos los nutrientes que necesitan, como el hierro.La Verdad: Debido a que los gustos de los niños pequeños son cambiantes, es posible que sus dietas no les estén proporcionando los nutrientes necesarios. Según la revista Nutrients, las estadísticas revelan que muchos niños pequeños tienen deficiencias de nutrientes, y que aproximadamente 1.5 millones de niños entre 1 a 5 años pudieron correr riesgos de padecer falta de hierro.Qué hacer: Combina alimentos nutritivos con otras opciones conocidas por los niños como crema de cacahuate, yogur y batidos de frutas mezcladas. Considera la posibilidad de incorporar una bebida nutricional para niños pequeños, como Enfagrow Bebida Nutricional para Niños Pequeños para eliminar esas deficiencias de nutrientes. Como se fabrica con leche real, Enfagrow tiene nutrientes como DHA, hierro y vitamina D. De hecho, dos porciones tienen el 70% del valor diario del hierro que necesitan para su desarrollo, y estimulan el crecimiento con tanto hierro como en el existente en más de dos galones de leche. Además, puede servirles como bebida para consumir en marcha, o usarla también como ingrediente en recetas de panes, batidos, arroz con leche y otros alimentos horneados."

            "body": "Enero es el Mes de concienciación sobre el glaucoma, una gran oportunidad para proporcionar más información sobre una enfermedad que afecta a más de tres millones de personas en los Estados Unidos. Dado que el glaucoma se presenta a menudo sin síntomas, y puede causar una pérdida significativa de la visión antes de que la persona note cambios en su capacidad de ver, es fundamental tener conocimiento de lo que se puede hacer para proteger sus ojos.Este año, tomar medidas para proteger su visión es más difícil, debido al impacto que la pandemia de COVID-19 sigue teniendo en nuestra vida diaria. El mes de enero es también, por lo general, un momento de transformación en la cobertura de los seguros médicos con cambios en los planes, reajustes de deducibles y copagos, y actualizaciones de los planes de medicinas recetadas. Sin embargo, a pesar de estos desafíos, la salvaguarda de su visión debe seguir siendo una prioridad.A continuación, tres medidas que puede tomar para controlar su salud ocular este mes:1. Coordine su examen ocular anualLa detección y el tratamiento a tiempo son fundamentales para controlar el glaucoma y otras afecciones que ponen en riesgo la visión. Por esa razón, es vital hacerse un examen ocular anual, especialmente si la persona es mayor de 40 años. Dado que algunas variantes del glaucoma son hereditarias, también es importante hablar con los miembros de su familia para determinar la existencia de antecedentes de la enfermedad. ¡Es probable que esta sea la primera vez que hable de este tema con su familia! Asegúrese de compartir la valiosa información que obtenga de estas conversaciones con su oftalmólogo durante su próxima visita.“El Mes de concientización sobre el glaucoma es una buena ocasión para sostener una conversación sincera sobre el glaucoma con sus familiares”, afirma Tom Brunner, presidente y director ejecutivo de la Fundación de Investigación del Glaucoma (Glaucoma Research Foundation). “Si hay antecedentes familiares de glaucoma, es posible que se corra un mayor riesgo de padecerlo. Lo más temprano que se detecte el glaucoma, lo más manejable podrá ser el tratamiento de la enfermedad”.2. Mantenga su plan de cuidado ocular al díaMientras que la pandemia ha provocado que muchos de nosotros consideremos posponer nuestras citas médicas en persona, es muy importante mantener las visitas programadas si le han diagnosticado glaucoma. El oftalmólogo tiene que verlo periódicamente para asegurase de que su visión permanezca estable y ajustar su tratamiento según sea necesario.Si le preocupa la seguridad de las visitas en persona, tal vez le sorprendan aprender acerca de las grandes medidas que su proveedor de atención oftalmotala ha tomado para ayudar a mantenerlo protegido. Cuando usted coordine su cita, el personal de la oficina le notificara de cualquier nuevo protocolo y requisitos de seguridad.“El distanciamiento social y otras medidas de protección están cambiando la experiencia del paciente en el consultorio”, asegura el Dr. Richard Lewis, especialista practicante en glaucoma y director médico de Aerie Pharmaceuticals. “Entre las medidas que hemos tomado en mi consultorio están el blindaje plástico en los instrumentos, el requisito de usar mascarillas faciales al personal y los pacientes, y minimizar el tiempo pasado en cuartos de exámenes y salas de espera.También es importante continuar tomando medicamentos recetados como parte de su tratamiento continuo del glaucoma. Una razón común por la cual dejamos de tomar nuestro medicamento para el glaucoma es por el precio. La clave es conocer los beneficios que ofrece su seguro médico para sus medicamentos, particularmente cuales están cubiertos y cuando se realizan los ajustes de deducible y copagos anuales.A la hora de comprar sus medicamentos, podría ser útil hacer comparaciones. El precio de un medicamento puede variar entre una farmacia y otra. Además, las farmacias de preferencia asociadas con su seguro médico ofrecen por lo general el precio más competitivo. Si usted es beneficiario de un plan que pertenece a la Parte D de Medicare, que no cubre su medicamento, su médico puede enviar una autorización previa para que pueda adquirirlo. Además, si tiene seguro comercial y está tomando un medicamento de marca, la compañía farmacéutica puede ayudarle en el aspecto financiero con programas de ahorro.3. Comprender sus opciones de tratamientoLas investigaciones científicas en curso, y el desarrollo clínico en el campo del glaucoma, han traído una serie de nuevas intervenciones médicas. De hecho, hoy en día su oftalmólogo tiene más opciones que nunca para tratar el glaucoma y proporcionar atención personalizada. Conviértase en su propio defensor informándose sobre todas las opciones de tratamiento disponibles, y analizando sus necesidades específicas con su médico.Un gran punto de partida es el folleto gratuito, Understanding and Living with Glaucoma (Comprender y vivir con glaucoma), publicado por la Fundación de Investigación del Glaucoma. Lo puede descargar o solicitar una copia en www.glaucoma.org/publicado. El sitio web de la Fundación también ofrece una amplia gama de recursos para ayudarle a tomar el control de su salud ocular durante el Mes de concienciación sobre el glaucoma y todo el año."

            "body": "Si hace ejercicio con regularidad es probable que desee incrementar sus resultados en términos de fuerza y tono muscular. Es fácil quedarse estancado en una rutina de ejercicios en la que sigue haciendo lo mismo y no ve mucho progreso. ¿Siente que se está quedando estancado?Si quiere lograr resultados reales y no lo está consiguiendo, aquí tiene distintos consejos para llevar sus objetivos de modelado corporal más lejos.Refuerce su entrenamiento cardiovascularSi está enfocado en la resistencia y solo está tratando de realizar sus entrenamientos cardiovasculares, recuerde que el entrenamiento intenso que lo pone en movimiento es beneficioso para la resistencia muscular, lo que incluye su corazón, el músculo más importante, y para la salud en general.[1] Varíe los entrenamientos para desafiarse a sí mismo. Pruebe hacer algo nuevo al inicio de su rutina como remar, bailar, andar en bicicleta o nadar.Considere realizar un entrenamiento de intervalos de alta intensidad (HIIT, por sus siglas en inglés) para obtener mejores resultados en la quema de calorías y grasas.[2] Los entrenamientos HIIT alternan periodos cortos de ejercicio de alta intensidad, como carreras de velocidad, que duran entre 45 segundos a unos pocos minutos, con periodos de ejercicio moderado o descanso que duran la misma cantidad de tiempo. Se ha demostrado que la combinación de HIIT con ejercicio moderado mejora la salud pulmonar.[3]Cambie su rutina de fuerzaConsulte con un entrenador para asegurarse de estar haciendo ejercicios que activen todos los principales grupos de músculos de su cuerpo, incluidos los glúteos y los músculos centrales esenciales, para obtener esos abdominales tonificados que tanto desea.Póngase a prueba y añada pesas libres, pesas rusas o ejercicios de gimnasia que no esté haciendo actualmente, 2-3 veces por semana. Dele tiempo a los músculos trabajados para descansar entre los días de entrenamiento de fuerza, o bien, alterne por día el entrenamiento de los grupos musculares para que tengan tiempo de recuperación.[4]Considere agregar rutinas que combinen fuerza con flexibilidad, como Pilates, barra o yoga, ya que pueden ayudar a mejorar su postura y apariencia.El modelado corporal puede ayudar a fortalecer y tonificar aún más los músculosAdemás del entrenamiento cardiovascular y de fuerza, CoolTone™ de CoolSculpting® puede ayudarle a fortalecer y tonificar sus músculos mediante la tecnología de estimulación muscular magnética (MMS, por sus siglas en inglés), que penetra en las capas musculares e induce contracciones musculares involuntarias que su cuerpo no podría lograr por sí solo. CoolTone™ es un dispositivo aprobado por la FDA que se aplica en la consulta médica para fortalecer, tonificar y reafirmar los músculos de su abdomen, glúteos y muslos.Se recomienda que los pacientes reciban 4 sesiones de tratamiento durante 2 semanas consecutivas. Por lo general los pacientes ven resultados después de las 4 sesiones de tratamiento, pero la cantidad de sesiones necesarias para ver resultados dependerá de cada persona y de la zona a tratar. Su proveedor de atención médica le puede entregar un plan para ayudarle a alcanzar sus objetivos de modelado corporal. Después de las sesiones de tratamiento, sus abdominales y glúteos se sentirán más apretados y tendrán una apariencia más definida y tonificada. Las sesiones de tratamiento tienen una duración promedio de 30 minutos por zona.“Por lo general, un candidato apropiado para CoolTone™ es alguien que está cercano a su peso corporal ideal, que no tiene contraindicaciones para el tratamiento y que busca mejorar la fuerza y el tono en su abdomen, glúteos o muslos,” afirmó la Dra. Sabrina Guillen Fabi, MD, dermatóloga certificada por la junta y profesora clínica asistente en la Universidad de California, San Diego. También dijo que los pacientes estaban emocionados de ver un cambio en su abdomen después de la cuarta y última sesión de tratamiento.La Dra. Fabi, quien participó en los ensayos clínicos de CoolTone™, compartió: “El tratamiento CoolTone™ puede ayudar a mejorar la fuerza y la definición muscular de los pacientes en la zona tratada. Considero este tratamiento como un complemento a un estilo general de vida saludable.”Si le interesa llevar aún más lejos sus objetivos de modelado corporal con CoolTone™, visite https://coolscul.pt/2RNaYKw para encontrar el proveedor más cercano.UsosEl dispositivo CoolTone™ está aprobado por la FDA para mejorar el tono y fortalecer los músculos abdominales y desarrollar un abdomen más firme. CoolTone™ también está aprobado por la FDA para fortalecer, tonificar y reafirmar glúteos y muslos.Información importante de seguridad El procedimiento CoolTone™ no es un tratamiento apto para todos. No debería recibir el tratamiento CoolTone™ en zonas con implantes/dispositivos metálicos, eléctricos, o electrónicos como marcapasos cardíacos, implantes auditivos, desfibriladores o neuroestimuladores implantados, bombas de medicamentos o aparatos auditivos.Informe a su proveedor de salud si tiene alguna afección médica, ya que CoolTone™ no se debe utilizar en la zona del útero durante el periodo menstrual, sobre zonas de la piel que carecen de sensibilidad normal, en pacientes con fiebre, tumor maligno, afecciones hemorrágicas, epilepsia, procedimiento quirúrgico reciente, insuficiencia pulmonar o embarazo.CoolTone™ debería ser utilizado con precaución en pacientes con la enfermedad de Graves (un trastorno autoinmune que causa hipertiroidismo), trastornos hemorrágicos activos o trastornos convulsivos.Las mujeres que están cerca del periodo menstrual pueden encontrar que con el tratamiento CoolTone™ se adelanta el periodo o que aumentan o se intensifican los calambres, por lo que se recomienda no someterse al tratamiento durante esta época del mes.CoolTone™ no debería ser utilizado en las zonas del corazón o la cabeza, zonas de crecimiento de hueso nuevo, sobre los nervios del seno carotídeo o sobre el cuello o la boca. CoolTone™ no debería ser aplicado sobre zonas hinchadas, infectadas o inflamadas o sobre erupciones cutáneas. Se debería tener precaución con los pacientes con sospecha o diagnóstico de problemas cardíacos.Los efectos secundarios comunes pueden incluir, entre otros, dolor muscular, espasmo muscular temporal, dolor temporal en las articulaciones o los tendones y enrojecimiento en o cerca de la zona de tratamiento.Consulte a su proveedor de atención médica si CoolTone™ es adecuado para usted.Consulte la Información importante de seguridad completa para obtener detalles adicionales.Los resultados y la experiencia de cada paciente pueden variar.[1] “Cardio 101: Benefits and Tips”.

            "body": "Desde el inicio de la pandemia, muchos estadounidenses han cancelado o pospuesto visitas al médico que no sean de emergencia. Al inicio las consultas estaban cerradas temporalmente, pero luego los pacientes evitaron el contacto personal con los médicos por temor a contagiarse con la COVID-19.En una encuesta de seguimiento realizada por Kaiser Family Foundation en mayo pasado, cerca de la mitad (48%) de los participantes afirmaron que ellos o alguien de su núcleo familiar había pospuesto o evitado atención médica debido a la pandemia. Y tal vez, sin causar sorpresa, el 11% de los adultos en general reportaron que el problema de salud propio o de otro familiar había empeorado debido a la posposición o cancelación de citas médicas. Si usted o su hijo padece de un trastorno crónico como alergias o asma, es probable que haya experimentado un mayor debilitamiento de su salud y bienestar por seguir dilatando la visita a su alergista.Si padece de alergias o asma, debe hacer que un alergista supervise con cuidado— y regularmente — sus medicamentos y salud general para mantener los síntomas bajo control. Como los alergistas están capacitados especialmente para ayudar a los pacientes a controlar con efectividad esos trastornos, es vital continuar con las visitas regulares para mantener los mejores resultados de salud posibles.Procedimientos de salud y protección Si usted es uno de tantos estadounidenses que ha evitado visitas al médico, preocupado por el contagio con la COVID-19, puede estar tranquilo, pues las consultas de alergistas en todo el país están implementando estrictos protocolos de seguridad, para proteger a pacientes y personal médico. “Nuestra primera prioridad como alergistas es mantener a pacientes y personal protegidos de la COVID-19, y mantener controladas al mismo tiempo las alergias y asma de los pacientes”, expresó el Dr. J. Allen Meadows, M.D., presidente del American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI). “Cuando usted visite una consulta, sepa que su alergista ha puesto en práctica protocolos para que su visita sea confortable y segura”.A continuación, algunas de las medidas de seguridad que emplean los alergistas:Por qué pudiera necesitar visitas presenciales al alergista Aunque algunos problemas se pueden analizar con el alergista usando la telemedicina, la mayoría de los tratamientos y procedimientos más cruciales de alergias y asma deben realizarse en la consulta, para garantizar que el paciente logre los mejores resultados de salud posibles.Pruebas de alergia: A la mayoría de los pacientes se les práctica un examen de la piel en la consulta para detectar sensibilidad a animales domésticos comunes (como perros y gatos), ácaros del polvo, tipos de césped, arboles, hierbas y moho. Si está tomando un medicamento que pudiera interferir con los resultados de la prueba de alergia, o si su piel es excesivamente sensible, o padece un trastorno grave de la misma, su alergista puede optar por hacerle un análisis de sangre.Vacunas contra la alergia: Si le están administrando vacunas contra la alergia, el procedimiento debe hacerse en persona. Las vacunas se aplican mediante un calendario con el propósito de incrementar la cantidad de alérgenos de forma regular. Por tanto, es mejor no interrumpir, evitar o posponer el día en que debe vacunarse.Reto oral con alimentos: Con el propósito de confirmar o descartar una alergia a algún alimento, se realiza una prueba de reto oral con alimentos (Oral Food Challenge, OFC). Durante la prueba OFC, se le da al paciente una pequeña dosis oral de alimentos primero, y luego dosis mayores bajo la supervisión de un alergista certificado para confirmar la tolerancia o alergia al alimento.Terapia biológica: La terapia biológica para dar tratamiento a trastornos alérgicos como asma, dermatitis atópica (eczema) o trastornos crónicos de los senos nasales, se debe administrar por inyección en la consulta del alergista, por lo menos al inicio.Si está retrasado con las visitas para supervisar y dar tratamiento a sus alergias y asma, llame hoy mismo a su alergista. Pregúntele cuáles son sus procedimientos actuales de salud y protección, para saber qué puede esperar cuando llegue a la consulta.Además, si tiene planificado visitar a un alergista por primera vez, necesitará presentar una historia de sus síntomas, y luego el alergista realizará un examen físico en su consulta. Usando esa información, el alergista puede determinar las pruebas de alergia apropiadas.¿Necesita encontrar un alergista certificado en su localidad? Use el localizador de alergistas de ACAAI."

Anímese a explorar las especias culinarias del Norte de África, con contrastes de sabores picantes, dulces y agrios. Las siguientes recetas usan uvas frescas que resaltan el sabor de las especias norafricanas en cada plato. Además, las uvas son un bocadillo fácil mientras vas preparando la cena.El bistec con especias Harissa y ensalada de uvas y limón en conserva aporta un gran sabor de forma fácil y rápida. Dos ingredientes del Norte de África: la mezcla de especias picante de pasta harissa, indispensable en la cocina marroquí; y el limón en conserva, delicioso condimento con un sabor sutilmente ácido pero con intensos rasgos de ese cítrico, ofrecen un contraste de acidez a la ensalada de uvas, refrescante y con un aderezo ligero. Deje marinar el bistec previamente y guárdelo en el refrigerador para cocinarlo ese mismo día, hasta el día siguiente para lograr un sabor más intenso, o incluso poco antes de colocarlo en la parrilla.Por su parte, la Quinoa con uvas y zanahorias asadas retoma el tema norafricano con un exquisito aderezo a base de comino, cilantro, pimentón y canela, acentuado por la dulzura sutil de las uvas crujientes y jugosas. Para ahorrar tiempo, prepare la quinoa y las zanahorias con anticipación y una ambos ingredientes para crear este plato acompañante justo antes de servir.

            "body": "Este es un año escolar impredecible, y como padres, es difícil no preocuparse por lo que pueda ocurrir. ¿Qué tal si mi hijo se retrasa debido al aprendizaje a distancia? ¿Y si a mis hijos les resulta difícil el regreso a las clases presenciales? Sin duda, este es un momento de ansiedad para muchos padres. De hecho, una encuesta reciente realizada por Understood/YouGov a dos mil padres de niños entre los 5 a 17 años, revela que al 71% de los participantes les preocupa que sus hijos tengan dificultades este año. Para los padres de niños a los que se les diagnostica o muestran señales de diferencias en la manera de pensar y aprender, la cifra es del 79%. Y cerca de la mitad del grupo encuestado (48%) muestra preocupación de que sus hijos puedan quedarse atrás académicamente a causa del “COVID slide”. El cierre de las escuelas en la primavera pasada le dio a los padres la oportunidad de entender más sobre el aprendizaje y el comportamiento de sus hijos. Para algunos padres, este proceso trajo consigo nuevas preguntas y preocupaciones, como:Casi cuatro de cada diez (37%) padres encuestados por Understood han notado comportamientos nuevos o diferentes en su hijo durante la pandemia. Tratar de entender los retos o diferencias no siempre es fácil. Pero obtener respuestas les permite a los padres y a los profesionales recibir apoyo para los niños lo antes posible. “Como cada niño es único, a los cuidadores les resulta difícil saber qué comportamientos son normales para su edad, y cuáles podrían ser las señales de alerta de que está ocurriendo algo fuera de lo común”, afirma Bob Cunningham, director ejecutivo de desarrollo del aprendizaje de la organización de impacto social Understood. “Como las familias ahora están pasando más tiempo juntas, puede que comiencen a notar cosas que no habían observado antes. Pero la buena noticia es que hay pasos fáciles que pueden tomar para entender lo que observan”. ¿Qué son las diferencias en la manera de pensar y aprender?Los niños se desarrollan a ritmos diferentes, y para las familias puede ser difícil interpretar lo que observan. Algunas de estas dificultades también pueden ser signos de diferencias en la manera de pensar y aprender, como la dislexia, el TDAH y la discalculia (discapacidad del aprendizaje en matemáticas). En los Estados Unidos, al menos 15 millones de niños,1 de cada 5, piensan o aprenden de manera diferente, y podrían tener dificultades con la lectura, la escritura, las matemáticas, la concentración y el seguimiento de instrucciones. Estas dificultades a veces son obvias, pero otras veces los signos pueden ser confusos. Por ejemplo, las faltas de ortografía pueden ser señales de dificultades con la lectura. O el no saber la hora puede ser señal de una dificultad con las matemáticas. Como los signos de las diferencias en la manera de pensar y aprender no siempre son claros, Understood creó la herramienta gratuita Take N.O.T.E. en colaboración con la Academia Americana de Pediatría. Esta herramienta está diseñada para ayudar a las familias a obtener respuestas sobre lo que observan en sus hijos. 4 pasos para comenzar a encontrar respuestas La herramienta Take N.O.T.E. consiste en un proceso simple de cuatro pasos:• Note si ocurre algo fuera de lo común con su hijo.• Observe y registre los patrones en el comportamiento de su hijo.• Tenga una conversación con su hijo y con sus maestros, ayudantes y cuidadores sobre lo que está observando.• Establezca vínculos con profesionales de confianza como los pediatras. “No saber lo que significan los distintos comportamientos o dificultades de su hijo o cómo ayudarlo puede ser estresante y abrumador para los padres y los cuidadores”, explica Cunningham. “Estos cuatro pasos pueden ayudarlo a aprender más y encontrar el mejor camino para ayudar a su hijo. Todas las personas que piensan y aprenden de manera diferente deben sentirse apoyadas en la casa, en la escuela y en el trabajo”. Visite el sitio web u.org/takenote-espanol para más detalles y acceso a la herramienta Take N.O.T.E. en español y en inglés. También encontrará un recurso digital gratuito con herramientas para detectar, observar y dar seguimiento a patrones en la conducta de su hijo."

            "body": "Ahora que comienza un nuevo año escolar, muchos estudiantes y sus familias están adaptándose a un ambiente diferente de aprendizaje. Aunque este año los preparativos para el regreso a la escuela puedan incluir la creación de un espacio para cursos virtuales en casa, el regreso a las aulas, o una combinación de ambas opciones, también podrían consistir en garantizar que su hijo (o hijos) tengan seguro médico. Pero, si no lo tienen, ¡no es tarde aun para buscarles cobertura!Los estudios revelan que el rendimiento académico y el seguro médico van de la mano. Los niños que tienen seguro médico pierden menos clases y obtienen mejores resultados académicos que aquellos que no tienen acceso al cuidado de salud. Más aun, la cobertura de salud no sólo beneficia a los estudiantes, pues faltar menos a la escuela implica faltar menos al trabajo para los padres. Gracias al seguro médico, los niños pueden tener acceso a atención de rutina y de emergencia, inmunizaciones, chequeos regulares, exámenes de la vista, visitas al dentista y los servicios de salud mental que pudieran necesitar para participar plenamente en la escuela y mantenerse enfocados en la clase. La cobertura de salud también ofrece acceso a las vacunas contra la influenza, e importantes cuidados si los niños se enferman o lesionan.En los Estados Unidos, millones de niños y adolescentes son elegibles y están inscritos en seguros gratuitos o a bajo costo a través de Medicaid y el Programa de Seguro Médico para Niños (CHIP, por sus siglas en inglés). Estos programas de salud pueden proporcionar acceso vital a la atención médica, para que los estudiantes se mantengan enfocados en su aprendizaje, y los padres tengan la tranquilidad de saber que sus hijos están protegidos dentro y fuera del salón de clases.En los últimos meses, muchas familias pueden haber pospuesto sus visitas al médico debido al COVID-19. Millones de niños en edad escolar que no tienen seguro médico podrían ser elegibles para los programas de Medicaid y CHIP. El inicio del año escolar es una buena oportunidad de ponerse al día con las visitas de bienestar y asegurar que los niños estén al día con sus inmunizaciones. Las vacunas, como la de la influenza estacional, son particularmente importantes este año. No sólo protegen a los niños contra las enfermedades y complicaciones graves, también pueden proteger a otras personas que pueden ser vulnerables a enfermedades graves como resultado de la influenza, como bebés y otros niños pequeños, personas de edad avanzada, o que padecen de problemas preexistentes. Medicaid y CHIP cubren las vacunas de rutina recomendadas como la de la influenza.Medicaid y CHIP ofrecen seguros médicos gratuitos o a bajo costo a niños y adolescentes elegibles hasta los 19 años. La elegibilidad depende del tamaño del hogar y los ingresos y varía según el estado. En promedio, una familia de cuatro personas que gana hasta $50,000 al año o más puede calificar para Medicaid y CHIP. La inscripción está abierta todo el año, pero la cobertura de salud se debe renovar anualmente.Usted puede hacer su solicitud de inscripción en línea, por teléfono, correo postal o en persona a la agencia de Medicaid o CHIP de su estado.

            "body": "La temporada de resfriados e influenza o flu, combinada con la pandemia que nos afecta, está motivando a muchos estadounidenses a hacer todo lo posible para robustecer su salud inmunitaria. Por suerte, simples hábitos de estilo de vida como una dieta sana, pueden marcar una gran diferencia en el fortalecimiento del sistema de defensa del organismo. Pero ¿cuáles alimentos son los mejores? ¿Y por qué?Cuando pensamos en los alimentos que estimulan el sistema inmunitario, recurrimos inmediatamente al zumo de naranja para una dosis rápida de vitamina C. “Aunque es cierto que las frutas cítricas respaldan el sistema inmunitario, hay muchos otros alimentos que ofrecen un impresionante conjunto de nutrientes que, según se cree, mantienen una sólida inmunidad”, afirma Sheri Kasper, dietista certificada. A continuación, tres alimentos sorprendentes y recomendados por los dietistas, que pueden contribuir a ahuyentar las enfermedades en esta temporada de resfriados y flu.1. Salmón de granja El salmón de granja ofrece una notable nutrición que puede protegernos contra todo tipo de dolencias, desde las enfermedades cardiacas a la depresión. Específicamente, respalda el sistema inmunitario gracias a dos nutrientes notables cuya existencia es rara en muchos otros alimentos: la vitamina D y los ácidos grasos omega-3. Si bien la vitamina D se vincula a menudo con la salud ósea, estudios recientes realizados en la Universidad de Boston indican que también puede ser vital para un funcionamiento inmunitario apropiado. Pocos alimentos son naturalmente abundantes en vitamina D, pero una porción de salmón de granja proporciona cerca del 33 por ciento de las necesidades diarias recomendadas. Los ácidos grasos Omega-3, que existen abundantemente en el salmón de granja, tienen una alta cualidad anti inflamatoria, y fortalecen el sistema inmunitario reduciendo la inflamación crónica. Kasper recomienda el salmón de granja procedente de Chile porque es criado en sostenibilidad, además tiene una alta proporción de ácidos grasos omega 3 y no contiene antibióticos ni mercurio.2. YogurtEl yogurt y otros alimentos fermentados contienen bacterias beneficiosas llamadas probióticos, conocidas por respaldar la salud digestiva o “del vientre”, evitando el crecimiento excesivo de bacterias perjudiciales. Además, se estima que mantener un equilibrio sano de las bacterias beneficiosas y perjudiciales estimula el sistema inmunitario. “La mayoría de las personas ignora que cerca del 70 por ciento del sistema inmunitario del organismo reside en el vientre”, añade Kasper. Además de contener probióticos, el yogurt también es uno de pocos alimentos casi siempre fortificados con vitamina D, que ofrece apoyo inmunitario adicional. Busque en las etiquetas de yogurt descripciones que contengan “Live and Active Cultures” (Cultivos vivos y activos) y evite el yogurt que contenga demasiada azúcar añadida. Pruebe el yogurt puro (sin ingredientes, y endúlcelo añadiendo rutas frescas y un chorrito de miel.3. Pimientos rojosLos pimientos rojos son ricos en vitaminas y antioxidantes que respaldan el sistema inmunitario. Un ejemplo es la vitamina C, que alienta la producción de los glóbulos blancos o leucocitos responsables de defender al organismo contra los patógenos. Los pimientos rojos contienen casi tres veces más cantidades de vitamina C que las naranjas. Además, tienen abundante vitamina A y el antioxidante beta caroteno, que puede ser convertido en vitamina A en el organismo cuando se necesita. La vitamina A es importante para el mantenimiento de las barreras mucosas naturales ubicadas en los ojos, vientre y otras partes del cuerpo. Dichas barreras atrapan las bacterias, y son esenciales para mantener una inmunidad óptima. Elija y consuma pimientos rojos porque tienen significativamente más vitamina A, C, y beta caroteno que los pimientos verdes.Aunque una dieta saludable no previene contra los resfriados de temporada, el flu u otras enfermedades virales, una combinación de los alimentos adecuados, ejercitación regular, y un estilo de vida balanceado, respaldarán las defensas de su organismo, y contribuirán a minimizar la duración y gravedad de la enfermedad.

            "body": "Cada día, cerca de 10,000 estadounidenses cumplen 65 años, y para el 2050, las personas de la tercera edad representarán más del 20% de la población.[i] Si usted tiene 65 años o más, mantenerse sano es más importante que nunca. Un paso que debe dar al respecto es inscribirse a un plan Medicare de medicamentos por receta de Medicare durante el Período de Inscripción Abierta que comenzó el 15 de octubre.Si usted paga sus medicinas por receta, un plan Medicare de medicamentos por receta puede ayudarle a ahorrar dinero. Cada plan proporciona una lista de medicamentos con cobertura, disponible en el sitio web y el centro de servicio al cliente del plan.Con las herramientas adecuadas y un colaborador confiable que le dé orientación, el proceso puede ser sencillo. Lea los consejos siguientes que le ayudarán a elegir un plan:#1: Considere un plan independiente o una combinación.Además de examinar los costos que pagaría de su bolsillo, y la cobertura de su plan, un buen paso para comenzar a la hora de considerar sus opciones es analizar un Plan Medicare de Medicamentos Recetados (PMM) y el Plan Medicare Advantage de Medicamentos Recetados (PMA). El PMM es un plan independiente que solo da cobertura a los medicamentos recetados. Por su parte, el PMA combina la Parte A (cobertura hospitalaria), la Parte B (cobertura médica) y usualmente la Parte D (medicamentos por receta) en un solo plan.[ii]#2: Evaluar el plan cada año.Los beneficios del plan Medicare de medicamentos recetados pueden cambiar anualmente, como la cobertura de medicamentos recetados, primas, deducibles y beneficios farmacéuticos. Incluso si mantiene su plan, es importante evaluar si el mismo sigue satisfaciendo sus necesidades. Y para 6 de cada 10 estadounidenses que padecen de al menos un trastorno crónico [iii] cuyo tratamiento podría necesitar múltiples medicamentos diarios, tener un plan con copagos mínimos puede ser vital. Hablar con un agente independiente de seguros puede contribuir a la evaluación de lo que le hace falta. Walgreens creó una alianza con eHealth*, agente independiente y certificado de seguros médicos, para ofrecer asesoría gratuita y personalizada, sin obligación de inscripción. Las personas que han usado eHealth[iv] se beneficiaron con ahorros promedio anuales de $710.#3: Asegúrese de que el plan seleccionado acepta su farmacia preferida.Verifique si su farmacia favorita está incluida en la red de su plan para ahorrar en costos de copagos. Los farmacéuticos también comprenden las necesidades individuales de medicamentos y le ayudarán a analizar las opciones de Medicare para medicamentos recetados.Los farmacéuticos desempeñan un papel vital en las comunidades, y, en estos tiempos, son recursos muy accesibles para responder nuestras dudas relacionadas con la salud. Los farmacéuticos de Walgreens han respondido de forma increíble para ayudarnos durante la pandemia, ya sea dedicando tiempo adicional en conversaciones telefónicas para contestar preguntas, o combinando reabastecimientos de medicamentos para adaptarse a las múltiples ocupaciones de los clientes, y reducir los viajes a la farmacia.#4: Explore maneras de reducir costos en la farmacia.Averigüe si su medicamento de marca tiene una alternativa genérica, y hable luego con su médico para determinar si es una buena opción. Si el medicamento no tiene alternativa genérica, podría haber otras variantes de marca y bajo costo para dar tratamiento a ese mismo trastorno. Pregúntele a su farmacéutico, y hable después con su médico para ver si el cambio de marca de medicamentos es aplicable a su situación específica.El período de Inscripción Abierta de Medicare comenzó 15 de octubre por todo el pais. Walgreens, una farmacia que el público conoce y en la cual confía, tiene varias herramientas tanto en sus establecimientos como en Internet para ayudarle a determinar cuál plan de medicamentos recetados es conveniente para usted y sus seres queridos. Visite el sitio web Walgreens.com/Medicare para más detalles y comenzar el proceso. Para hablar con un agente certificado de seguros eHealth, llame al número telefónico 1-844-973-1713. Los usuarios de TTY deben usar el 711 o visitar ehealthmedicare.com/Walgreens.*eHealth es un agente certificado de seguros. Walgreens no recibe ninguna comisión.

Un paso que debe dar al respecto es inscribirse<span style=\"font-size: 15px; background-color: #f5f5f5;\"> a un plan Medicare de medicamentos por receta de Medicare durante el Período de Inscripción Abierta que comenzó el 15 de octubre.</span></p><p>Si usted paga sus medicinas por receta, un plan Medicare de medicamentos por receta puede ayudarle a ahorrar dinero. Cada plan proporciona una lista de medicamentos con cobertura, disponible en el sitio web y el centro de servicio al cliente del plan.</p><p>Con las herramientas adecuadas y un colaborador confiable que le dé orientación, el proceso puede ser sencillo. Lea los consejos siguientes que le ayudarán a elegir un plan:</p><p><strong>#1: Considere un plan independiente o una combinación.</strong></p><p>Además de examinar los costos que pagaría de su bolsillo, y la cobertura de su plan, un buen paso para comenzar a la hora de considerar sus opciones es analizar un Plan Medicare de Medicamentos Recetados (PMM) y el Plan Medicare Advantage de Medicamentos Recetados (PMA). El PMM es un plan independiente que solo da cobertura a los medicamentos recetados. Por su parte, el PMA combina la Parte A (cobertura hospitalaria), la Parte B (cobertura médica) y usualmente la Parte D (medicamentos por receta) en un solo plan.<a rel=\"nofollow\" name=\"_ednref2\"></a><a href=\"#_edn2\" rel=\"nofollow\"><sup>[ii]</sup></a></p><p><strong>#2: Evaluar el plan cada año.</strong></p><p>Los beneficios del plan Medicare de medicamentos recetados pueden cambiar anualmente, como la cobertura de medicamentos recetados, primas, deducibles y beneficios farmacéuticos. Incluso si mantiene su plan, es importante evaluar si el mismo sigue satisfaciendo sus necesidades. Y para 6 de cada 10 estadounidenses que padecen de al menos un trastorno crónico <a rel=\"nofollow\" name=\"_ednref3\"></a><sup><a href=\"#_edn3\" rel=\"nofollow\">[iii]</a></sup> cuyo tratamiento podría necesitar múltiples medicamentos diarios, tener un plan con copagos mínimos puede ser vital. Hablar con un agente independiente de seguros puede contribuir a la evaluación de lo que le hace falta. Walgreens creó una alianza con eHealth*, agente independiente y certificado de seguros médicos, para ofrecer asesoría gratuita y personalizada, sin obligación de inscripción. Las personas que han usado eHealth<a rel=\"nofollow\" name=\"_ednref4\"></a><a href=\"#_edn4\" rel=\"nofollow\"><sup>[iv]</sup></a> se beneficiaron con ahorros promedio anuales de $710.</p><p><strong>#3:</strong> <strong>Asegúrese de que el plan seleccionado acepta su farmacia preferida.</strong></p><p>Verifique si su farmacia favorita está incluida en la red de su plan para ahorrar en costos de copagos. Los farmacéuticos también comprenden las necesidades individuales de medicamentos y le ayudarán a analizar las opciones de Medicare para medicamentos recetados.</p><p>Los farmacéuticos desempeñan un papel vital en las comunidades, y, en estos tiempos, son recursos muy accesibles para responder nuestras dudas relacionadas con la salud. Los farmacéuticos de Walgreens han respondido de forma increíble para ayudarnos durante la pandemia, ya sea dedicando tiempo adicional en conversaciones telefónicas para contestar preguntas, o combinando reabastecimientos de medicamentos para adaptarse a las múltiples ocupaciones de los clientes, y reducir los viajes a la farmacia.</p><p><strong>#4:</strong> <strong>Explore maneras de reducir costos en la farmacia.</strong></p><p>Averigüe si su medicamento de marca tiene una alternativa genérica, y hable luego con su médico para determinar si es una buena opción. Si el medicamento no tiene alternativa genérica, podría haber otras variantes de marca y bajo costo para dar tratamiento a ese mismo trastorno. Pregúntele a su farmacéutico, y hable después con su médico para ver si el cambio de marca de medicamentos es aplicable a su situación específica.</p><p>El período de Inscripción Abierta de Medicare comenzó 15 de octubre por todo el pais. <a href=\"https://www.walgreens.com/topic/pharmacy/walgreens-medicare-part-d.jsp?o=acs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Walgreens</a>, una farmacia que el público conoce y en la cual confía, tiene varias herramientas tanto en sus establecimientos como en Internet para ayudarle a determinar cuál plan de medicamentos recetados es conveniente para usted y sus seres queridos.

            "body": "No es sorprendente que muchas pequeñas empresas luchen por mantener sus operaciones, recibir ganancias y sostener su fuerza laboral luego de la crisis económica provocada por la pandemia de la COVID-19.Sin embargo, en los Estados Unidos, muchos propietarios de pequeñas empresas pertenecientes a minorías étnicas siguen siendo optimistas sobre el futuro, en comparación con sus contrapartes no diversas, aunque reconocen la necesidad de un mayor apoyo gubernamental, de sus comunidades y del sector privado.Esos fueron los hallazgos de la encuesta nacional Small Business Mindshift 2020 realizada recientemente por Union Bank, institución financiera que ha prestado servicios a pequeñas empresas en la Costa Oeste durante más de 155 años.El sondeo determinó que, en los Estados Unidos, el 34% de los propietarios de pequeñas empresas (SBO, por sus siglas en inglés) pertenecientes a minorías étnicas pueden “ver un camino hacia delante” para el éxito futuro del negocio y la supervivencia a pesar de la COVID-19. En comparación con lo anterior, solo el 20% de los SBO no diversos pronostican esos resultados. Los SBO pertenecientes a minorías han sido también más proactivos en comparación con sus colegas a la hora de formar nuevas estrategias para enfrentar los cambios impuestos por la pandemia. A propósito de ello, el 24% piensa que la COVID-19 ha tenido un efecto positivo en sus negocios, en comparación con solo el 12% de los SBO no diversos. El grupo de SBO pertenecientes a minorías que participaron en la encuesta incluyen afroamericanos, Latinx y de origen asiático.“Las revelaciones de la encuesta reafirman lo que ya sabemos —los pequeños negocios que pertenecen a minorías étnicas se han esforzado siempre a pesar de circunstancias difíciles o entornos externos— y como resultado, son más resilientes y adaptables”, afirma Frank Robinson, Ejecutivo para mercados diversos y programas comunitarios de Union Bank. “Los pequeños negocios pertenecientes a minorías étnicas son el el espíritu de sus comunidades locales, y como tal, tenemos el compromiso de ayudarlos a recuperarse y prosperar, proporcionándoles apoyo adicional para su estabilidad económica, y las herramientas necesarias para tener éxito en su progreso”.Otras revelaciones de la reciente encuesta del Banco:Los SBO pertenecientes a minorías adaptan mejor sus estrategias comercialesEn general, los SBO estadounidenses pertenecientes a minorías han demostrado significativamente más innovación que los demás, en lo referente a adaptar prácticas comerciales para mantenerse a flote: el 52% ha modificado productos o servicios; el 50% ha modificado sus productos en línea, y el 47% ha cambiado sus campañas publicitarios en línea.Los SBO radicados en California confrontan dificultades, pero los pertenecientes a minorías son más optimistasLos SBO en California se sienten más desanimados e inseguros en comparación con otros dueños de pequeñas empresas de los Estados Unidos. Solo el 13% de los dueños de pequeñas empresas californianas afirman ver un camino hacia delante cuando se trata de la supervivencia de sus negocios, en comparación con el 23% de SBO en general en los Estados Unidos. Además, el 41% afirmó que el proceso de solicitud de la ayuda financiera que podría ayudar a sus negocios es demasiado complejo para intentarlo siquiera.Una vez más, sin embargo, los SBO pertenecientes a minorías en California han demostrado más innovación y optimismo durante estos tiempos, y han sido más propensos que sus colegas a implementar nuevas estrategias. No solo son más propensos a haber adoptado papeles de liderazgo en sus comunidades— el 55% tiene un mayor sentido de responsabilidad para ayudar a sus comunidades, en comparación con el 44% de los SBO no diversos —sino que, además, están obteniendo más apoyo a cambio, pues el 39% se siente respaldado por sus comunidades locales, en comparación con el 33% de los SBO no diversos.La vacuna contra la COVID-19 es vital para el éxitoEl 75% de los dueños de pequeñas empresas en los Estados Unidos afirmó que su éxito y supervivencia futura serán determinadas por las elecciones presidenciales, mientras que dos de cada tres consideran las elecciones 2020 como las más importantes en sus años como dueños de empresas. Sin embargo, la gran mayoría afirmó que la disponibilidad (o la carencia) de una vacuna contra la COVID-19 será el principal factor que afecte a sus empresas en los próximos seis meses.Como una forma de apoyo a las pequeñas empresas, y de hacer frente a las injusticias sociales y raciales en los Estados Unidos, Union Bank tomó la iniciativa en junio pasado de crear un Programa de Recuperación Comunitaria de $10 millones para proporcionarles a los SBO acceso a capital, empresariado, retención laboral y recapacitación.“Esta pandemia ha golpeado a todas las pequeñas empresas, y particularmente a las que son propiedad de minorías, extremadamente fuerte”, asegura Todd Hollander, Director de banca comercial y pequeñas empresas de Union Bank. “Pero cada día vemos cómo nuestros clientes encuentran formas creativas de mantener sus puertas abiertas y el pago de sus empleados.

            "body": "Conozca a Josh, tejano de 46 años con cuatro hijos, que lleva una vida muy activa y disfruta montar motocicletas y pasar tiempo al aire libre con sus hijos y nietos. Sin embargo, su vida experimentó un cambio súbito cuando fue hospitalizado de urgencia con un diagnóstico de insuficiencia cardiaca congestiva, y pasó varias semanas recibiendo tratamientos. Dos años después, cuando Josh pensó que había dejado atrás su problema cardiaco, su esposa comenzó a preocuparse al notar que su corazón latía irregularmente. “Una noche, mi esposa estaba acostada y apoyada sobre mi pecho, y sintió que mi corazón latía de forma irregular”, afirma Josh hablando de su arritmia. “No sé durante cuánto tiempo estuve con ese ritmo cardiaco. Mi esposa insistió y llamé a mi médico al día siguiente, y luego me hospitalizaron por una fibrilación atrial”.La fibrilación atrial (descrita también como AF o AFib) es el trastorno del ritmo cardiaco más común que afecta a más de 33 millones de personas en todo el mundo.[1] La AF también implica un mayor riesgo de accidentes cerebrovasculares e insuficiencias cardiacas.[2][3] Cuando se produce una AF, las cámaras superiores del corazón laten muy rápida e irregularmente, afectando la capacidad del corazón de bombear sangre de manera eficiente al resto del cuerpo.Si bien Josh tenía antecedentes de insuficiencia cardiaca congestiva, causa común de AF, nunca experimentó ningún síntoma de ese padecimiento. Por suerte, gracias a la identificación de las señales de AF y de la búsqueda precoz de tratamiento, Josh pudo analizar con su médico la mejor manera de controlar su arritmia.Aunque la experiencia de cada paciente puede ser diferente, hay cuatro preguntas a considerar u analizar con su médico, para garantizar que está informado sobre las señales y síntomas de AF, y de las mejores formas de controlar este trastorno cardiaco común. Cuatro preguntas sobre la AF que debe hacerle a su médico Conocer las señales, síntomas y factores de riesgo para detectar la AF con anticipación, puede salvar su vida. La AF afecta con mayor frecuencia a personas con enfermedades cardiacas ya existentes, o a aquellas que han padecido un ataque al corazón, o tienen insuficiencia cardiaca congestiva, o se han sometido a una operación del corazón. Entre otros factores de riesgo están la hipertensión, arterias obstruidas, diabetes, tiroides hiperactiva, enfisema u otras enfermedades pulmonares, infecciones virales, apnea del sueño, fatiga y edad avanzada.Entre los síntomas usuales de AF están:Con frecuencia, la detección de la AF puede ser complicada, pues la misma se presenta a menudo sin aviso. El cuarenta por ciento de quienes padecen de este trastorno que pone en peligro la vida no tienen síntomas, debido a lo cual muchos doctores la consideran como un asesino silencioso. Los pacientes pueden detectar precozmente la AF si notan que el corazón late de forma intermitente, con un ruido sordo o golpe seguido de un ritmo cardiaco acelerado durante un lapso de tiempo considerable, o también síntomas similares a los de un infarto cardiaco.Los médicos pueden usar una o más de estas pruebas para determinar si un paciente tiene AF:En el caso de Josh, el Monitor Cardiaco Insertable (ICM) fue la herramienta escogida para determinar lo que estaba ocurriendo en su corazón.Los ICM se implantan mediante un proceso mínimamente invasivo, y el dispositivo de coloca debajo de la piel por medio de una pequeña incisión en el lado superior izquierdo del pecho. Esto facilita que los médicos supervisen continua e inalámbricamente los latidos del corazón del paciente hasta por un período de tres años.El diagnóstico de AF puede ser abrumador y va acompañado de múltiples preguntas: causas, síntomas, opciones de tratamiento, etc. Es importante hablar con su médico para sentirse confiado en su diagnóstico y en el camino a seguir.Existen muchas opciones de tratamiento para los pacientes con AF, como medicamentos, cardioversión, ablación por catéter y procedimientos quirúrgicos de ablación.La ablación por catéter es realizada por un electrofisiólogo (EP), médico dedicado a las enfermedades del corazón, que se especializa en ritmos cardiacos. Es un procedimiento mínimamente invasivo en el cual el médico introduce un tubo delgado y flexible (catéter) por los vasos sanguíneos hasta llegar al corazón. Hay dos tipos de procedimiento de ablación por catéter: uno consiste en el uso de energía fría para congelar el tejido (crioablación), y el otro es a base de calor (ablación por radiofrecuencia). Josh eligió la crioablación como tratamiento. Por su parte, la ablación quirúrgica también se usa en el tratamiento de ritmos anormales, pero el acceso al corazón es más invasivo, pues se realiza mediante una operación a corazón abierto.Con un diagnóstico precoz y tratamiento, se puede controlar la AF para que no afecte su calidad de vida en general.Tomemos a Josh como ejemplo. Después de su crioablación dijo lo siguiente: “Mi corazón ha vuelto a funcionar normalmente y no estoy tomando medicamentos. Sigo teniendo mi dispositivo para detectar la AF, y desde la crioablación no he tenido más episodios de AF”.Por cierto, Josh ha vuelto a montar su motocicleta, y sigue disfrutando a plenitud sus viajes por carreteras, así como del tiempo que comparte con su esposa y familiares.Si usted o un ser querido experimenta síntomas de AF, hable inmediatamente con un médico.

Sin embargo, su vida experimentó un cambio súbito cuando fue hospitalizado de urgencia con un diagnóstico de insuficiencia cardiaca congestiva, y pasó varias semanas recibiendo tratamientos. Dos años después, cuando Josh pensó que había dejado atrás su problema cardiaco, su esposa comenzó a preocuparse al notar que su corazón latía irregularmente.</p><p> “Una noche, mi esposa estaba acostada y apoyada sobre mi pecho, y sintió que mi corazón latía de forma irregular”, afirma Josh hablando de su arritmia. “No sé durante cuánto tiempo estuve con ese ritmo cardiaco. Mi esposa insistió y llamé a mi médico al día siguiente, y luego me hospitalizaron por una fibrilación atrial”.</p><p>La fibrilación atrial (descrita también como AF o AFib) es el trastorno del ritmo cardiaco más común que afecta a más de 33 millones de personas en todo el mundo.<a name=\"_ftnref1\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn1\" rel=\"nofollow\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> La AF también implica un mayor riesgo de accidentes cerebrovasculares e insuficiencias cardiacas.<a name=\"_ftnref2\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn2\" rel=\"nofollow\"><sup>[2]</sup></a><a name=\"_ftnref3\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a><a href=\"#_ftn3\" rel=\"nofollow\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Cuando se produce una AF, las cámaras superiores del corazón laten muy rápida e irregularmente, afectando la capacidad del corazón de bombear sangre de manera eficiente al resto del cuerpo.</p><p>Si bien Josh tenía antecedentes de insuficiencia cardiaca congestiva, causa común de AF, nunca experimentó ningún síntoma de ese padecimiento. Por suerte, gracias a la identificación de las señales de AF y de la búsqueda precoz de tratamiento, Josh pudo analizar con su médico la mejor manera de controlar su arritmia.</p><p>Aunque la experiencia de cada paciente puede ser diferente, hay cuatro preguntas a considerar u analizar con su médico, para garantizar que está informado sobre las señales y síntomas de AF, y de las mejores formas de controlar este trastorno cardiaco común. </p><p><strong>Cuatro preguntas sobre la AF que debe hacerle a su médico </strong></p><p>Conocer las señales, síntomas y factores de riesgo para detectar la AF con anticipación, puede salvar su vida. La AF afecta con mayor frecuencia a personas con enfermedades cardiacas ya existentes, o a aquellas que han padecido un ataque al corazón, o tienen insuficiencia cardiaca congestiva, o se han sometido a una operación del corazón.

Usa siempre el cinturón de seguridad Según las estadísticas más recientes de choques reportadas por la Administración Nacional de Seguridad del Tráfico en las Carreteras (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, NHTSA) en el 2018, aproximadamente 1 de cada 3 menores de 12 años que fallecieron en choques de vehículos no estaban usando car seat, asiento elevado (booster) ni cinturón de seguridad. En cuanto a los niños con edades entre 8 y 14 años, cerca de la mitad de la cifra de fallecidos (45%) no estaban usando sus cinturones de seguridad. Recuerda siempre comprobar que tus hijos tengan abrochado el cinturón antes de poner en marcha el vehículo, especialmente en la medida que se van haciendo mayores y más independientes.2. Perfecciona tus conocimientos sobre los car seatsAunque hayas abrochado a tu hijo año tras año en el car seat, es buena idea revisar periódicamente los elementos básicos de seguridad, para garantizar que no pasas por alto ninguna medida importante. No te apresures. Dedica tiempo a practicar cómo abrochar correctamente el cinturón a tu hijo, usando como guía el manual del car seat.3. Considera una inspección virtual del car seat En todo el país hay técnicos certificados que pueden ayudarte a instalar y usar correctamente el car seat de tu hijo, y con frecuencia totalmente gratis. Además, muchos ofrecen inspecciones virtuales de car seats en las que puedes hablar con un experto desde tu propia casa. Para enterarte de las opciones de inspección de car seats en tu comunidad, visita el sitio web NHTSA.gov/Protegidos.4. Busca el car seat correcto para tu hijo Además de instalar correctamente el car seat, también es importante garantizar que tu hijo use el car seat correcto para su edad y tamaño. Verifica los límites de uso del car seat o del asiento elevado (booster) de tu hijo para saber cuándo debes cambiarlos. Para que tengan la mayor protección en caso de choque, los niños no deben cambiarse al próximo tipo de car seat hasta que supere los límites de altura o de peso del que está usando.5.

Si alguien no recibe suficiente insulina, el azúcar en sangre podría dispararse después de una comida. Por otro lado, el azúcar en sangre podría caer de golpe si alguien recibiera demasiada insulina, no comiera tanto como esperaba, realizara una actividad física exigente, estuviera sometido a un alto nivel de estrés, o por muchas otras razones. Un error y la persona podría terminar en el hospital debido a un nivel muy bajo de azúcar en sangre.Un nivel de azúcar en sangre muy bajo, o hipoglucemia grave, ocurre cuando el nivel de azúcar en sangre es tan bajo que se genera una falta de glucosa en el cerebro. Esto puede ser extremadamente aterrador y podría provocar que una persona se desmaye, tenga convulsiones, entre en coma y, si no se tratara, podría poner en peligro la vida. Es un momento emocional que genera una huella que permanece durante meses o incluso años. La hipoglucemia grave es una emergencia que requiere atención inmediata.Hasta hace poco, el único medicamento disponible para tratar este tipo de emergencia era un kit que requería muchos pasos para su preparación y uso, lo que hacía que una situación aterradora lo fuese aún más. El proceso era tan complicado que solo alrededor del 30% de las personas podían usarlo correctamente.2 El resultado fue que muchas personas optaran por ni siquiera obtener una receta médica para el kit. En lugar de ello, si su nivel de azúcar en sangre bajaba demasiado, le decían a familiares, amigos o compañeros de trabajo que llamaran al 9-1-1.Ahora está disponible Gvoke HypoPen™ (inyección de glucagón), el primer autoinyector premezclado para niveles muy bajos de azúcar en sangre. Gvoke HypoPen es fácil de administrar, por lo que cualquiera puede usarlo. Y es un método de administración probado: el 99% de las personas pudieron usar Gvoke HypoPen correctamente.2De la misma forma que una persona con alergias graves llevaría consigo un lápiz de epinefrina para autoadministrarse el medicamento de forma rápida y eficaz después de una picadura de insecto o una reacción alérgica a un alimento, el Gvoke HypoPen listo para usarse también puede brindar confianza en un momento potencialmente mortal.El estrés y los horarios inconsistentes (lo que muchos experimentan como resultado de la COVID-19) pueden aumentar el riesgo de generar niveles muy bajos de azúcar en sangre en personas con diabetes.3-4 Por ello, más que nunca, las personas con diabetes necesitan una herramienta confiable en episodios de azúcar en sangre muy baja.Si tiene diabetes y utiliza insulina, lo más probable es que haya experimentado un episodio de baja azúcar en sangre, donde el desmayo siempre fue una preocupación importante. Con Gvoke HypoPen™, ahora tiene una herramienta que puede ayudarle a convertir un posible momento de crisis en una situación manejable.No espere hasta después de vivir un episodio aterrador para hablar con su médico sobre nuevas opciones para tratar los niveles muy bajos de azúcar en sangre, como Gvoke HypoPen.

            "body": "La lucha para terminar con la epidemia del VIH ha durado más de cuatro décadas y ha impulsado avances e innovaciones importantes en su tratamiento y atención. Sin embargo, el progreso ha sido irregular y frágil, y han quedado al descubierto grandes disparidades en la atención y el acceso a la salud por los cuales ciertos sectores demográficos han sido desproporcionadamente impactados por el VIH y el sida, lo que ha remarcado la creciente crisis de salud dentro de la comunidad latina.Los datos recientes muestran que, si bien los diagnósticos de VIH han disminuido o se han estabilizado en los últimos años, los diagnósticos de VIH entre hombres latinxs gay y bisexuales continúan en ascenso e impactan directamente a más de 195,000 hombres hispanos/latinxs en los Estados Unidos y sus territorios, lo cual incluye a Puerto Rico[i]. Estos datos demuestran que el estándar de atención en salud no beneficia a todos por igual[ii].Para muchos hombres latinxs que viven con o son afectados por el VIH o sida, esta disparidad se cimienta en una variedad de factores sociales y culturales que están fuera de su control; entre ellos, una serie de problemas sistémicos de muchos años, como la pobreza y el acceso desigual a la educación, a la vivienda y al transporte público seguro y confiable, lo cual impacta los resultados de salud en general[iii]. Sumado a esto, las clínicas y organizaciones no siempre ofrecen materiales de educación de salud en español o servicios de traducción a los más de 37 millones de hispanoparlantes que se estima que viven en los Estados Unidos[iv]. La falta de materiales y proveedores de atención médica culturalmente receptivos y adaptados al idioma representa una barrera tanto práctica como psicológica para la atención y el cuidado de la salud.“Cuando comencé a trabajar en el área del VIH, era la única persona LGBTQ en el equipo de trabajo. Nadie más sabía y entendía lo que se sentía y cómo se veía ser gay y latino en nuestra comunidad. Mi presencia moldeó y cambió nuestra forma de brindar servicios”, dijo el licenciado en terapia matrimonial y familiar Elías Díaz médico especializado en salud mental del Distrito Hospitalario del Condado de Maverick. “Los hombres a los que ofrecemos apoyo nos cuentan historias sobre sus experiencias con el VIH y en ellas se encuentran temas comunes: los estigmas en torno a su diagnóstico y a ser LGBTQ, la falta de apoyo emocional y, en algunos casos, la dependencia de drogas. Han luchado por encontrar recursos que reflejen sus experiencias. Lo que se estaba haciendo con y para la comunidad LGBTQ latina simplemente no era suficiente”.El miedo y el estigma asociados a un diagnóstico positivo se ven agravados por las fuerzas dinámicas de la familia, la religión, la cultura, la economía, a lo cual se suma el sentimiento antiinmigrante dirigido hacia la comunidad latina. Estos factores contribuyen a las discrepancias en los servicios que se ofrecen a los hombres latinxs, que enfrentan dificultades más allá de su diagnóstico y de la atención médica[v].Para responder a estas necesidades, los líderes y defensores de la comunidad coinciden en la importancia de vigilar el panorama cambiante y las necesidades de los hombres latinxs gay, bi y trans de todas las edades en diferentes vecindarios, situaciones económicas y estados de inmigración. El nuevo informe Here As I Am / Tal Como Soy, del programa Acción Positiva para Hombres Latinxs de ViiV Healthcare, retoma los aprendizajes y perspectivas obtenidos a través de una iniciativa de escucha dirigida por la comunidad para investigar cómo las fuerzas sociales, económicas y políticas afectan la salud y el bienestar de los hombres latinxs, y cómo influyen el acceso y la adherencia a la atención de las personas que viven con VIH. El informe, cuya elaboración tomó 10 meses, presenta historias en primera persona de miembros de la comunidad que han contribuido a identificar e impulsar soluciones para marcar una diferencia en la vida de los hombres latinxs que viven con y son afectados por el VIH.“A raíz del aumento de diagnósticos de VIH y sida en nuestras comunidades, estamos haciendo sonar la alarma para exigir un cambio. Conozco demasiados casos de personas que tienen miedo de dar seguimiento [a su tratamiento] con sus proveedores de atención médica debido a la infraestructura inadecuada y a la falta de servicios culturalmente relevantes. Esto, así como el miedo y la vergüenza internalizados en nuestra comunidad, crea una barrera evidente para el acceso a la atención y amenaza nuestra supervivencia”, dijo Miguel Ángel (ex gerente asociado de defensoría en NMAC). “Como líderes y defensores que llevan muchos años trabajando en esta área, tomamos la iniciativa al hacer que nuestras voces sean escuchadas y al expresar nuestras necesidades con el objetivo de involucrar a proveedores y legisladores en soluciones que mejoren nuestro acceso a la atención y aseguren que todas las iniciativas de prevención tomen en cuenta la justicia en el idioma y en las tantas otras necesidades únicas de la comunidad latina”.Para leer Here As I Am/Tal Como Soy y obtener más información sobre el compromiso de ViiV Healthcare con las soluciones impulsadas por la comunidad a través de la iniciativa Acción Positiva para Hombres Latinxs, visite bit.ly/2Tbc2IU, donde encontrará el informe en inglés y español.[i] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Estos factores contribuyen a las discrepancias en los servicios que se ofrecen a los hombres latinxs, que enfrentan dificultades más allá de su diagnóstico y de la atención médica<sup><a title=\"\" href=\"#_edn5\" rel=\"nofollow\" name=\"_ednref5\">[v]</a></sup>.</p><p>Para responder a estas necesidades, los líderes y defensores de la comunidad coinciden en la importancia de vigilar el panorama cambiante y las necesidades de los hombres latinxs gay, bi y trans de todas las edades en diferentes vecindarios, situaciones económicas y estados de inmigración. El nuevo informe <em>Here As I Am / Tal Como Soy</em>, del programa <em>Acción Positiva para Hombres Latinxs </em>de ViiV Healthcare, retoma los aprendizajes y perspectivas obtenidos a través de una iniciativa de escucha dirigida por la comunidad para investigar cómo las fuerzas sociales, económicas y políticas afectan la salud y el bienestar de los hombres latinxs, y cómo influyen el acceso y la adherencia a la atención de las personas que viven con VIH. El informe, cuya elaboración tomó 10 meses, presenta historias en primera persona de miembros de la comunidad que han contribuido a identificar e impulsar soluciones para marcar una diferencia en la vida de los hombres latinxs que viven con y son afectados por el VIH.</p><p><a rel=\"nofollow\" name=\"_Hlk53410695\"></a>“A raíz del aumento de diagnósticos de VIH y sida en nuestras comunidades, estamos haciendo sonar la alarma para exigir un cambio. Conozco demasiados casos de personas que tienen miedo de dar seguimiento [a su tratamiento] con sus proveedores de atención médica debido a la infraestructura inadecuada y a la falta de servicios culturalmente relevantes. Esto, así como el miedo y la vergüenza internalizados en nuestra comunidad, crea una barrera evidente para el acceso a la atención y amenaza nuestra supervivencia”, dijo Miguel Ángel (ex gerente asociado de defensoría en NMAC). “Como líderes y defensores que llevan muchos años trabajando en esta área, tomamos la iniciativa al hacer que nuestras voces sean escuchadas y al expresar nuestras necesidades con el objetivo de involucrar a proveedores y legisladores en soluciones que mejoren nuestro acceso a la atención y aseguren que todas las iniciativas de prevención tomen en cuenta la justicia en el idioma y en las tantas otras necesidades únicas de la comunidad latina”.</p><p>Para leer <em>Here As I Am/Tal Como Soy </em>y obtener más información sobre el compromiso de ViiV Healthcare con las soluciones impulsadas por la comunidad a través de la iniciativa <em>Acción Positiva para Hombres Latinxs</em>, visite <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2Tbc2IU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bit.ly/2Tbc2IU</a>, donde encontrará el informe en inglés y español.</p><p><a title=\"\" href=\"#_ednref1\" rel=\"nofollow\" name=\"_edn1\">[i]</a> Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
