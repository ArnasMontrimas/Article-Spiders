Since the application is very young, you may not wantto have everything at one time. Not only will it help speed up development,adding the features over time will increase usability, where adding them rightaway may drive users away and create clutter when scraping the code.Before launching a website to the public, consider releasing a beta version forusers to get a feel of the final product. Launching a 'closed beta'is inviting a select number of people to test a product before it is releasedto the public. An 'open beta' is inviting everyone from the publicwith a notice that everything is still in testing phase. 'ReleaseCandidates' are the near final release of the product.

If a given set of test articles causes cytotoxicity in human or animal cell lines they are not likely to succeed in later animal studies or in the clinic. Cytotoxicity screens are used early in the drug discovery pipeline to identify lead compounds and rule out compounds that are likely to cause drug failure. Among these early screens there are a number of assays used to understand potential drug liabilities due cytotoxicity. The first cytotoxicity assays often run by organizations are known as “cell viability assays”. Cell viability assays frequently take the form of a low cost ATP assay that allows compounds to be rapidly be compared to reference compounds. These early  cell viability studies are often “High throughput” meaning a large number of compounds are run to rank order test articles based on general toxicity. Additional cytotoxicity screens include assays that study specific mechanisms of toxicity. These mechanistic cytotoxicity screens are often run after initial cell viability studies to give greater detail on the causes of toxicity to the researcher.

It widely accumulates in landfill and oceans causing global warming, deaths to animals, and diseases to humans. However, we continue to produce and use them. Why?", "word-count": 587, "body": "Plastic is very prevalent and has become an inseparable part of our lives. We use it in almost everything because of its extreme versatility that allows us to tailor it for our different needs. Plastic is useful from its smallest to largest form. Microplastics which are smaller than 5 millimeters are mixed in cleaning and beauty products to help exfoliate dirt thoroughly. Macro plastics on the other hand are used to make different objects such as containers, cellphones, and even large vehicles like ships and airplanes.Plastic has distinct characteristics that are not found in other materials. It is lightweight, long lasting, water and chemical resistant, good electric insulator, low cost, and easily molded to different shapes making it a suitable substance for different usage.This material is widely used for food packaging in restaurants and groceries. Plastic plays an important role to create disposable sterile materials such as syringes, gloves, IV tubes, and catheters for hospitals. It allows schools to cut expenses by using plastic tables and chairs for classrooms which is more affordable than woods. And, it provides safety for electrical devices as it is an excellent electric insulator.Plastic is beneficial for all industries making it impossible to stop its production. Other materials are not suitable as its substitute. For instance, metal or glass cannot be use as an alternative to plastic car trim as they are heavy and would consume more fuel during travel. Using wood is also not a good choice as it would require cutting more trees which would cause more impact in the environment.Everyday we are reminded of the harmful effects of plastic on our planet. It quickly accumulates landfill and oceans as it is nonbiodegradable unlike other materials such as wood or paper. Plastic takes decades or even centuries to decomposed. To make the matter worse, it releases harmful chemicals in water and soil which might stay forever. These chemicals are even more dangerous than the solid waste that we see. They can be consumed by land and marine animals causing them death or can be transferred to us as we consume the contaminated animals. Furthermore, these chemicals might also affect the quality of soil and water which can lead to poor agricultural and fish supplies.Plastic pollution is a result of our mismanagement and negligence. We enjoyed the convenience of using plastic so much that we use them even for disposable or single-use items. Most of the plastic wastes that we see are from households and food packaging that we simply drop in bins without thinking of reusing or recycling them. Many cleaned-up attempts have been made to reduce plastic pollution but they are unable to cope up with the increasing amount of plastics entering the environment. Therefore, reducing the inputs of plastic waste in landfill and oceans must be prioritized. A global approach is important in achieving this by offering high-level solutions which could include banning the use of plastic bags and disposable bottles worldwide and applying scientific solutions like using plastic-eating mushrooms which was discovered in 2017 –studies and planning are  ongoing with regards to this new discovery.Our individual actions are also important in dealing with plastic pollution. We need to discipline ourselves to avoid using plastics as much as possible. Carrying your own drink container instead of buying bottled water, bringing your own bag when doing groceries, using clay pots for your plants instead of plastic pots, reusing plastic containers as long as possible, and recycling are just few of the things you can do to lessen plastic wastes.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/environment/solutions-to-reduce-plastic-pollution.html"},

To save you here are the six most important points that you have to keep in mind before selecting a cotton t-shirt. A hundred percent cotton fabric is the best for wearing in any climatic condition. But there are t-shirts which also come as a blend of cotton and synthetic fibers. There are also t-shirts which are 100 percent polyester. Therefore it is imperative that you pay keen attention to the fabric of the t-shirt. An important point to keep in mind is that don’t let the design overpower the fabric type that you want to buy. A t-shirt cotton t-shirt is a must-have to feel the breeze in summer. And a  will make the wearer look instantly cool.The one where the t-shirt goes wrong usually is the size and the fit. Properly try a t-shirt and choose the one that fits you perfectly. When buying a t-shirt online it can become tricky as the size varies for each brand. What you can do is take a measuring tape and measure according to the size chart and select the one that fits you perfectly as a lock and key. Also, one more thing to keep in mind is that a cotton t-shirt might shrink after a wash so it is better to get a size that is larger than your size.Two types of fabric are used to make a t-shirt; a jersey fabric and interlock fabric. The interlock fabric is densely knit and won't curl up and it is used to make durable t-shirts and of premium quality. While jersey fabric is thin and not durable. You can get a t-shirt based on your purpose.Know what a high quality 100 percent, pre-shrunk contains. It is a t-shirt that doesn’t have any itchy synthetic fiber and doesn’t shrink or go out of shape even after several washes. The best cotton t-shirt will have GOTS certification that is the global organic textile standard certification. This indicates that the fabric is safe from harmful and chemical dyes.Sewing flaws are something that has to be noticed while buying a t-shirt that is made with jersey fabric. The elastic knit leads of the fabric might sometimes lead to stitch formation failures. It may also lead to a non-aligned underarm seam and sidearm seam which will not be aesthetically appealing.While buying a cotton t-shirt the price of the t-shirt has to be looked into. There are chances that a normal t-shirt might cost you high and after buying you might find it is totally not worth it.

Legal Risk Selling a home involves not only purchase contracts, but also many disclosures and escrow paperwork.  Another thing to consider is correctly filling out those forms and executing it so that it is legal and in your best interest.2. Exposure When a Realtor lists your home, we do not just put up a for sale sign and call it a day. We list and market your home so that every Buyer and Agent will know your home is for sale.3. Professional Job This is a professional task and it needs a professional to get the job done right.  When your teeth hurt, you would go to the dentist to get your teeth removed.

The San Francisco figures include five inner Bay Area counties. We may be past the crest of the crazy. Home price growth is slowing down in San Francisco — April was the first time in 13 months that the region’s housing market grew by less than 20 percent year-over-year. Still, prices are going up.During the past two decades, Bay Area home prices have followed a similar pattern during economic cycles: They go up, then they go down and then they go up again, but each time they go up, they go up higher than before. And depending on where you are looking, we may not be at that point yet.Prices shot up during the tech boom in the late 1990s then dropped after the bust. They peaked even higher in 2006 before hitting a recession low in 2011. They have been on the upswing again, but as of April, the region as a whole is still 14 percent lower than its previous peak in May 2006.That’s not true everywhere. Several cities in the region have already zoomed past previous peaks such as San Francisco, Fremont, Berkeley, San Mateo, Redwood City, Alameda, Pleasanton, Menlo Park, Foster City, and Lafayette.Prices will likely continue climbing, but just not at the level they have over the past two years, said Stan Humphries, chief economist at Zillow, a real estate information company. Prices have gone up 15 percent during the last year, according to Zillow’s estimates, and that will slow to about 7 percent in the next year while the historical average is about 3 percent growth per year.“We predict San Francisco is going to grow at half of its current pace for the next 12 months, but that pace is still incredibly bullish compared to historical averages,” he said.“We’re seeing more inventory than last year, that’s a good thing,” Humphries explained. “What’s keeping price appreciation so high is that there are not enough homes to choose from on the market, so buyers are bidding up prices.”Job growth remains the top driver propelling Bay Area home prices, so as long as that continues, home prices are likely to keep rising, Carlisle said.Most economic cycles last five to seven years, so it’s possible since the recovery started in 2011, we are only a few years or halfway through the current cycle.Carlisle still sees the market as “crazy,” with homes selling quickly and buyers bidding up home prices — in May, 29 percent of San Francisco homes sold for 20 percent or more over asking price.“This has been the most ferocious market I’ve seen in 25 years,” he said.Factors that would cause home prices to drop would be a decline in job growth or wages and upticks in interest rates. Right now, the average Bay Area homeowner puts 39 percent of their income into their mortgage, but that percentage could up to 51 percent if interest rates go up just two percentage points.“People can afford things right now, but if interest rates go up, then they won’t be able to,” Humphries said. “Prices could fall or stay flat for a long time until income catches up.”", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/writing/bay-area-home-prices-rise-18-percent-how-much-higher-can-they-go.html"},

But as of now I really appreciate the efforts of my parents in instilling the value of honesty. Everybody needs an honest person beside them although this is a luxury that everyone cannot have. So far I have been able to know that living an honest life is not easy and requires a different point of view in explaining the intention of course of actions.

One lie is all it takes to banish and lose a person’s trust and change the person’s perception towards you. Being honest is one of the key founding values of a strong friendship. Throughout my life, my father always stressed the importance of honesty as it is the backbone of one’s word and actions. Without honesty, words would be vague without any meaning. Trust issues have infested and destroyed numerous relationships simply because people cannot be honest with each other. I recall an incident in high school when my friend lied to me that she did not use my credit card but later I discovered and until now I cannot trust her with my stuff. Although telling the truth may hurt our friend’s feelings, we have decided between living a lie or telling the truth. I have learned that being honest is worth the risks and is significant in building relationships.Being honest comes with numerous privileges. The virtue of honesty gives a person a good reputation. For instance, an honest person uses his/her reputation to manipulate others to trust made decisions and actions. Most honest people are bound to be fruitful leaders with a lot of people relying and depending on them.

My parents taught me that nobody is perfect and man is full of errors and if I ever make a mistake, I should not lie about or try to cover it. Admitting to our own mistakes and being responsible for the choices we make can be difficult for some people since most of them lack the virtue of being honest. Due to this, most people are held accountable for mistakes they did not commit just because the person who committed it does not want to admit or become reliable for his/her mistakes. A real-life example is when a person is convicted for a crime he/she did not commit, and the person who committed it is left free in society knowing somebody else is suffering for his or her own mistakes and actions. Some mistakes can make literary break family bonds if someone lies about them and later it is discovered.In conclusion, honesty is an important value that everyone should pose and adheres to in order to achieve an ethical lifestyle. An honest person is a morally upright person who cannot betray the trust bestowed upon him. Future relationships are depended on the degree of honesty in current relations. In acquiring a person’s trust, you must be honest with them and always humble in admitting your own mistakes.

It’s really not as simple as taking a chainsaw to the base of a tree and letting rip. Tree felling requires serious planning if we are to avoid damaging nearby property or injuring people.", "word-count": 959, "body": "Felling trees is a dangerous job. It’s really not as simple as taking a chainsaw to the base of a tree and letting rip. Tree felling requires serious planning if we are to avoid damaging nearby property or injuring people. So, how are trees taken down? This depends on where the tree is and how big it is. The plan to remove a tree will incorporate lots of different aspects in the plan – nearby buildings and roads, utility lines and landscaping. Arborists also use a whole kit of special equipment like ropes and rigging to help them with their job. Here are some of the considerations arborists make when assessing a tree to be felled: Techniques for Taking Down Different Types of TreeJust as each tree is unique, so is the way it is removed. Different types of trees often require different tree felling techniques. A deciduous tree, for example, will have a wider tree canopy than a coniferous tree so the tree removal approach is often different.   Straight FellingWhen removing trees, we often refer to ‘straight felling’. This means removing a tree as a single unit. This is only possible when the environment allows i.e. when there is enough space for the tree to be felled without causing any damage to property or landscaping nearby. When trees are removed using straight felling, arborists will control the tree’s removal by using guide ropes and wedges so that the tree falls in a way that is both safe and expected. Sectional FellingWhen a tree can’t be removed by straight felling (if, for example, there isn’t a lot of space surrounding it), then a technique called sectional felling is used. This means that the tree is removed in sections so that there is no damage to surrounding obstacles like utility lines, roads, buildings or landscaping.When doing a sectional felling, there are many different techniques and methods used. As always, these are adapted for each unique tree, which makes expert knowledge and experience essential.Tree felling with sectional dismantling means that a skilled climber will often need to climb up the tree to secure an anchor point. The climber will then abseil down the tree to work on the lowest limb first, working his or her way up the tree. Sometimes, rigging equipment is also needed. Tree RiggingThis is the art of sectional felling using blocks, pulleys and ropes to aid in the dismantling of trees or parts of trees. Rigging equipment incorporates a whole host of various equipment and often needs extensive knowledge of equipment, rope types and strengths, wood properties and physics. As with all tree work, communication is also essential between workers when on site. The BasicsTree rigging has a range of complexities. Even a simple rope thrown over and attached to a branch is classed as basic tree rigging. People on the ground will hold onto the end of the rope while the arborist is tasked with cutting off the branch. The person on the ground will guide the branch to the ground. This basic technique of tree rigging is one of the oldest and simplest in existence. It relies on the person on the ground being strong enough to hold the branch’s weight. The climber also needs to have the ability to judge the weight of the branch to ensure the rope is the right strength. There are variables too that make this task even more of a challenge. This includes the friction between the branch and the rope as well as the force applied by the person on the ground. High-end Tree RiggingWhile the basics are simple enough, there are high-end tree rigging techniques too. Modern tree rigging often uses high modulus poly ethylene (HMPE) ropes. These ropes don’t stretch at all! Other modern pieces of kit include pulleys that are almost frictionless, capstan winches on lowering bollards that apply tension to 44:1 and laptops with hooked up dynamometers capable of calculating angles and cutting forces for tree branch removal where there is surround property or obstacles. Techniques for Tree RiggingThere are many different ways to fell a tree and modern arborists will incorporate the basic tree rigging techniques all the way up to high-end techniques in their day-to-day tree removal work. Every tree-rigging situation can be made as simple or as complex as the arborists need but it’s worth remembering that tree felling is never risk-free.Arborists have to recognise the large forces generated when removing and lowering branches and wood on ropes. Forces don’t just disappear; they have to go somewhere and are changed into sound or heat.If, for example, a branch section is lowered too fast and the wood is too heavy, ropes can melt and weaken. In a worst-case scenario, the tree might fail altogether with snapping and breaking sounds. Nowadays, with modern technology, it is rare for these things to happen as long as arborists are well trained in the safe removal of branches.With modern tree rigging techniques, it is mainly the tree and the ropes themselves that act as shock absorbers to dissipate generated forces. If a tree has a structural issue then this will always be taken into consideration and if necessary, tree rigging will involve the use of a helicopter, hi-ab or crane.With correct forethought, well-planned execution of techniques, equipment and teamwork, there are endless ways to lower timber and branches safely and efficiently from trees. Final ThoughtsAn arborist’s job isn’t just a physical one! Tree surgeons need to know all about the laws of physics as well as mathematics when planning to remove trees. It’s a highly-skilled job that needs a lot of training – inadequate training and improper techniques can be very costly indeed, not to mention highly dangerous. It’s always best to call in the professionals!", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/gardening/different-methods-of-taking-down-a-tree-explained.html"},

More specific:- Total watts of appliances consuming electricity must not exceed watts of the generator. It is best to use 85% of the generator's running watts.- When using a 2000w generator, users do not use a voltage stabilizer to excite electricity.- Do not plug the generator into the main electrical panel in the house. This will turn the generator into a transformer. At this time, a family member or neighbor may receive an electric shock.- When installing equipment or using generators, attention should be paid to the bridge. Turn off the mains circuit breaker and make sure all appliances are in the inactive state.- Install additional support equipment.- When using a generator, it should run idle for 5 to 10 minutes, then plug in electrical equipment.- Do not touch the device with wet hands or the machine is operating.- Turn off the generator properly.In particular, when using a 2000w generator, you should aim for oil-powered products. Although generally gasoline generators are reasonably priced, they run smoothly and are small in size compared to diesel generators. But we see that diesel engines are 1.5 times more efficient than gasoline engines in the same segment. Besides, the cost of diesel fuel is quite cheap and safe.Methods of preservationGenerator maintenance is a very important step, but often not focused by the users. Therefore, over time, durability and safety may change. Therefore, each of us needs to equip ourselves with information to preserve products.- Put the generator in a cool, dry place.- Do not place generators indoors- When the generator is not in use for several days, turn it on and leave it idle for 5 to 10 minutes.- After each use, check the whole equipment, add oil to the generator.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/gardening/how-to-use-the-2000w-generator-safely-and-effectively.html"},

Do not be limited in your imaginations, and be creative - this would prove to be important in the design.Now, do not just leave these images in your mind, recreate it on a piece of paper as a sketch. Don't be too worried about the finesse of the drawing, show it to your friends and a professional, and make adjustments.• Plan your landscape depending on the landBefore planting anything, it is crucial to study the land. Understand the soil needs and type of soil on the property. The topography of the land is also vital for the survival of any plant on the soil; you can fill up a sloping part where you want to plant with sand.Determine the kind of plant that will survive in such soil; you don't want to keep replacing withered plants. Covering plants should be planted in sandy or marshy soils.• A central point is essential in the designImagine a home without the living room - impossible. The central point in your garden is the point in which you want to build everything around. The centre point will also determine the pathways that will demarcate the garden. A central point gives you the idea of the perfect place to start your gardens and hedges.• Be patient and meticulousCreating a worthy landscape for your home is not a day's job, you'll need to perfect some designs, add hedges, plant, fill the soil, etc. so you have to be patient and wait for your results. You don't need to start creating the full picture of how you want your garden to be; you can start by executing small projects/works.When you complete these smaller tasks, then you can begin to get a clearer image of the landscape you want.• Blend in the varying differencesYour landscape will contain varying types of plants, shrubs, and flowers; while some plants will be taller than the others, some plants will be more colourful and cheery than others, etc. It would help if you threw these differences to your advantage by creating a perfect blend of these differences; like placing the taller plants behind smaller ones and putting brightly coloured flowers above dull/deep-coloured plants. Also, you can create repetitions of particular shrubs or flowers.ConclusionFinally, it is an important point to create a landscape that would be beautiful and magnificent all through the seasons. Though it is most common for plants to wither during the harsh seasons of winter, other tough flowery plants bloom into mid-winter. Proper blending of these plants will give your landscape a beautiful look all year round.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/gardening/how-to-create-a-perfect-landscape-design-sydney-for-your-home.html"},

{"heading": "Hybrid Learning: A Complete List of Essential Resources", "author": "ViewSonic ME", "description": "Hybrid learning is quickly becoming a valuable teaching strategy for teachers worldwide. However, one of the many talking points is the accessibility of technology for students and how to overcome those hurdles. With some innovation and the right information, you can make hybrid learning accessible to a higher margin of students.", "word-count": 1667, "body": "Hybrid learning is a great solution to adopt since many schools are focusing in on student-centered learning even during distance learning. Hybrid learning puts the student first as many of its core benefits relate to student flexibility, inclusivity, and collaboration. Not to mention, it does not completely remove the element of face-to-face that some students may need for their education.The biggest downside for hybrid learning is that it requires technology. And often technology is what causes there to be a gap in accessible education for students. Knowing what is required and what is extra is great because it allows you to format a learning environment that is accessible to all students. Whether you only have laptops or have access to , hybrid learning is for everyone.Hybrid learning is a type of blended learning that refers to implementing synchronous lessons that are taught simultaneously in-person and online.Hybrid learning is great because it allows the children who need face-to-face instruction to receive that while those who desire a more flexible approach can receive that as well. Hybrid learning also allows for varying teaching strategies to be used with only a fraction of the challenge. Required technologies for hybrid learning means the basics of what you should have. Whether this is in the physical classroom, or the student’s home space, these are the technologies you should have to have successful hybrid learning. Also keep in mind, you should have at least one or more, you do not necessarily have to have every single technology if they are not accessible for you.A desktop computer or a laptop is required for hybrid learning. Many modern classrooms can implement hybrid learning with just laptops. Though it is not ideal, it is possible. Computers are great because they are very versatile and powerful.Computers are often used for notetaking, writing, and independent research. What is also great is that many laptops have built-in microphones and videoing technology. Some even have student packages that include Microsoft 365 or other software for student work. Computers are also great for connectivity between classmates and instructors.Video technology is important for hybrid learning because many modern teaching strategies focus on student-centered learning. Apart of student-centered learning is student collaboration and active learning. If students cannot see each other, they will have a difficult time interacting. Also keep in mind, that hybrid learning is more than just simply recording a video, it is active and synchronous.Many technologies have built-in video technology but consider purchasing a separate webcam for hybrid learning. This way you can be sure you have clear quality so that all students can easily see each other and present work if collaborative and sharing software are not available.Microphones are another important element for hybrid learning. Many technologies will include a microphone option in their hardware, but sometimes they may not be high quality or pick up a lot of noise. An option to solving this is by purchasing an external microphone.Thankfully, a good quality external microphone can be quite cheap, or very expensive. It depends on your budget, needs, and educational space. For example, it may be more beneficial for a distanced student to get a microphone with noise cancelling abilities than it would be to have one in the physical classroom.Collaborative software is not a physical hardware. But it is something you should highly consider when creating a hybrid learning space. These can be free things like Google Classroom, all the way to advanced systems purchased by your school district.Even more so, many interactive whiteboards, like the ones you will learn about in the next section, have pre-installed software that you can use for your classroom. A great example of this is the Viewboard complete with the myViewBoard software for the perfect hybrid learning solution.However, distanced students may not be able to access the software outside of classroom, so be aware and choose the best software setup for your students.Displays are more important for the physical classroom. This is because they are often more expensive, and most of the functionality will be used inside the classroom. There are three main types of displays you can consider.Interactive Whiteboards is a catch-all term for any large-format display that also responds to real-time actions on its surface. Typically, these mimic whiteboarding functionalities like notetaking but also provide an interactive screen. Having at least one interactive whiteboard in the physical classroom is a great way for in-class students to share their notes or brainstorming with those who are distanced. Even better, if the distance students have the right technology, such as a touch-enabled laptop, they too can write and share on the board.Projectors are commonplace in many classrooms, old or new. They have great functionality and often are affordable for many school districts. Projectors are normally used as simple displays as even the smartest of projectors require an outside device like a laptop. However, if you simply need a cheap way to help display distance students in the classroom, projectors are a great option and a must-have.Wireless Presentation Displays are large-scale displays often used as commercial displays or as a front-of-the-room display in classrooms, boardrooms, and anywhere else they’re needed.  displays, or WPDs for short, are not touch-enabled, so they ideal for lecture-style lessons from either an in-person instructor or remotely, especially if the environment isn’t ideal for projectors.And in many hybrid learning setups, large screens are prominently displayed to the teacher so that they address in-person and remote students simultaneously. Since this display doesn’t need touchscreen functions – but needs to be clearly visible in any lighting – well-placed WPDs are an excellent addition to the hybrid classroom.Supplementary technologies are not necessarily required but can enhance your students’ comfort and productivity. These technologies can also be supplementary in that they are perfect for accommodating students or providing them with an extra option of assistive EdTech.External mice may not seem that important since many laptops tend to have built-in trackpads. However, these often wear down much quicker than their external counterpart and are less accurate. To help save you or your student frustration and hand cramps, consider purchasing an external mouse. Even more so, if you have a student with physical impairments, there are even different types of computer mice that can better fit their hand shape for extra comfort.Touch monitors are a great option for students who attend hybrid classes that are more interactive. If your student’s physical classroom has an interactive whiteboard, it might be worth it to purchase an external touch monitor for them. This is because outside of the touch-enabled feature for more collaboration, many touch monitors are built with better ergonomics to keep your student healthy and more productive.Tablets also work well since they are portable and highly functional. However, they are much more limited than a computer, so it may not be ideal to rely heavily on tablets for hybrid learning. However, they do have the option for video and microphone if it is the best option accessible for you. Nonetheless, tablets are a great way to add extra materials or helpful notes for students who may need accommodations. They are great for reading textbooks or notetaking with an external tablet-compatible keyboard.Smartphones are often overlooked due to most teachers seeing them as a distraction rather than a tool. However, smartphones are great for extra materials and educational APPs. For example, if you are doing a hybrid language learning class, you can prompt students to download APPs like Duolingo for self-study rather than assigning homework. Not to mention, smartphones are great for creative videography and photography. And several students actually are so tech-savvy, they use their smartphones for doing their homework!Advanced technologies are suggested for private schools or schools that have lots of resources. Unfortunately, many schools do not receive much funding or have difficulties receiving government aid, so while these may upgrade your classroom, remember hybrid learning, at its core, is the same as other forms of teaching. If your students are provided with fun and engaging activities, they will learn just the same. But if you have the option to upgrade, here are some suggestions for you:Multi-display setups for ideal for hybrid teachers that want to use more advanced collaborative strategies. This might include setting up two interactive whiteboards at opposite ends of the classroom or having two or more projectors. With this type of setup, it is much easier to incorporate group collaboration strategies like a jigsaw for students to brainstorm and create. But multi-display setups can be done with multiple monitors or even smartphones and tablets depending on the desired result.Augmented reality (AR) is becoming increasingly popular in many schools worldwide. This is because it is an easy method to increase engagement and interactivity. Though keep in mind, it is still a relatively new technology. However, there are simple augmented reality APPs for both free and paid that are perfect for educational purposes. With the right “triggers” or “markers” you can display things like animals and dinosaurs to help young learners with labelling for example. Best of all, most AR apps, despite being young, are easily sharable and accessible.If you want to learn more, here are 6 benefits and 5 examples of augmented reality in education!Learning management systems (LMSs) are defined differently depending on the school’s organizational needs. Typically, an LMS is used for giving out and tracking remote learning objectives. But more advanced LMSs have built-in eLearning authoring tools, have advanced storing and tracking, and basically can distribute all school-related information. The scope of your LMS depends on your school needs and resources. But for the innovative and creative teachers out there, you can often get away with a well-formatted Google Drive and solid e-mail organization if you find yourself in a crunch.Hybrid learning resources depend highly on your school and situation. It is important to acknowledge that for many students, even the required essentials may not be accessible to them. If that is the case, try talking to administrators to see what your school budget is to get the ball rolling.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/education/hybrid-learning-a-complete-list-of-essential-resources.html"},

Most college students are battling issues such as substance abuse, anxiety, and depression. However, only a few students reach out to professionals to get help. If no action is put in place, the issue can negatively impact the students' academic performance. So, the campuses need to put in place ways to help students struggling emotionally. We all hope for the best in the future. So, according to , to help the community at large, the campus administration should include a public health system to improve campus students' overall social life. When there are more concerns, the rate of substance abuse and suicidal thinking goes down. The campus admin can use the following guiding principles to help the students live a better life.According to research, staying alone throughout is a sign of low emotional health risk and can easily promote suicide. So, a good support system from the campus, family, friends can help minimize such risks. The college should include programs that teach about life skills. We can't assume that all is okay. There are stressful moments in college. Including professionals to teach about depression, anxiety, and substance abuse should be on the line up of activities. Above all, such professionals help students with different ways of overcoming such challenges. Some students prefer to stay silent on the matters affecting them. At times, they don't know who to trust and share their issues with. In other cases, they don't know how to approach the matter, which can be damaging. The reason for reluctance in seeking help is the lack of mental awareness on the campus. The campus staff should have a cognitive awareness facility where students can freely visit to seek help. According to studies, limiting access to means leading to suicide minimizes accidental death rates or suicide actions. Items such as poisonous chemicals and dangerous weapons should not be allowed anywhere in the campus compound. Also, measures should be put in place to avoid access to rooftops or extreme heights while on campus. While students who need help might fail to come forward for help, the campus must know how to know students suffering from emotional torture. Let everyone in school know how to identify a student who needs help and refer them to the appropriate people for support. ConclusionThere is too much pressure on students. Some have issues with tuition payments, while some come from emotionally unstable backgrounds. Whatever the case is, such students require adequate help to help them concentrate on their studies.  It is the campus's duty at large, family, and friends to offer support when needed to save students from depression and anxiety.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/education/the-rise-of-mental-health-awareness-in-colleges.html"},

But for high school students especially, the pandemic has also had a significant impact on their ability to plan for the next step in their education journey: college.High school seniors have, so far, generally been the most impacted by the effects of COVID-19. All of this craziness is happening during the time where they are supposed to be balancing finishing up their high school career with things such as finishing up standardized tests, applying for college, visiting schools, and of course, making plans for how they are going to work to afford their impending college tuition. All of these pieces in the puzzle that current high school seniors are planning for have been massively interrupted due to many factors such as:Lack of ability to travelThe pandemic has, of course, made traveling anywhere (whether it’s to the grocery store or across the country) a great safety risk. This means that many current high school seniors will have a harder time taking tours of the schools that they are applying/accepted to, ultimately making the decision of where to enroll in a much more difficult one. To combat this, many colleges and universities have started to offer virtual tours, but, the consensus among most high school seniors is that they certainly don’t compare to being able to step on campus in person.Family member’s loss of jobs The unemployment rates since the start of the pandemic have risen to astronomical numbers, and unfortunately, many families with high school and college-aged young adults have not been excluded. This means that many of these students will have more trouble figuring out how they are going to pay the rising prices of college tuition, room and board, textbooks, and more.Test center closureWhile perhaps some high school seniors have finished with the standardized testing process, many were counting on taking tests at the start of their senior year. With lockdowns and restrictions in place, getting this done has proved to be, once again, a very difficult task for high school seniors. If a senior doesn’t have a current score that they are satisfied with using to submit with their applications, the question then becomes “should I even submit a score at all?” as many schools across the country are becoming “test-optional”. However, there is still a cloud of mystery surrounding the logistics of not submitting test scores, and students are left wondering if this will ultimately hurt their chances of getting accepted. Difficulty balancing the application process with virtual school. Another problem that high school seniors are encountering is the stress of balancing applying to colleges with virtual/remote school. After speaking to several high school seniors, I was informed that school being remote has certainly not led to it being any easier. In fact, teachers have been using this as an opportunity to provide students with even more work, which ultimately cuts into the time that students can spend on perfecting their college essays, sending off applications, and doing other essential college planning. So, you may be wondering, what can high school seniors do during these crazy times to take action towards reducing at least some of the stresses that they may be feeling? When it comes to easing some of the financial burdens that COVID-19 has caused, one solution is to apply for scholarships! Scholarship money is money that, unlike loans, does not need to be paid back ever. This means that all high school seniors should start, if they haven’t already, with applying for scholarships to help ease some of the impending financial burdens that they are soon to face upon graduating from high school and starting college. The process of applying for scholarships may seem overwhelming, but it doesn’t have to be!

Plus they didn’t even ask to hear from you. So it’s best to keep the emails short and direct.What’s in it for them?When someone is being cold emailed, they know that you’re trying to sell them something. In that case, the best thing to do is let them know what they’re going to get out of this and not feel like a random stranger’s asking them for money.Share different features of your product or serviceWhen we were working on our follow-up emails, we decided it’d be a better idea to share different aspects of the service we’re promoting rather than saying the same thing in different ways.That way, the readers get a better picture of what they’re being offered.Plus it won’t look like spam.Stay organizedSince we planned on reaching out to a lot of people, we created a system to track the people we emailed, how many times we emailed them, when we emailed them, if they responded, etc.This makes our lives a lot easier and a lot less stressful.There they are, four different things I learned from cold emailing.In fact, some of these lessons don’t just apply to cold emailing, they also apply when you send emails to people on your email list too.If you want to learn more about writing good emails to your email list, check out How to Become an Email Titan.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/email/what-i-learned-from-writing-cold-emails.html"},

Thus, use technology to help yourself in managing time for your studies and other activities. Set Your GoalsAnother pro tip that will help you in managing your time effectively is setting your goals. A student mostly loses time when there are no goals and objectives, and he/she gets lost in their studies. If you set your study goals and objectives, it will help you in giving direction. Always set realistic goals that you can easily achieve. By setting up goals, you can easily control your time by allotting specific time for single tasks. It will help you in making collective moves, and you will complete your task within no time.Make Up a Plan Planning is very important in every field.

Once you set your goals and objectives to manage your time, then the next step is to make up a plan. Create a working plan according to your goals and objectives. Include all your tasks along with the deadlines to make a plan.Use ChecklistCreating a checklist is very helpful especially when you are a student. If you want to manage your time effectively, then you should create a checklist. When one has many things in mind, then making a “To-do list” proves to be beneficial. You can create a checklist on your phone and can edit it accordingly. One Task at a TimeAnother effective tip in the list to manage time is doing one task at a time. If you carry more than one task at a time, it becomes difficult and no task gets completed. Therefore, always complete one task and then move on to others. When you complete one task it gives you the satisfaction that at least one thing is eliminated from the list of activities and reduces pressure from the mind. According to the research done by neuroscience brain only performs one function at a time and multi-tasking is only a myth. If you are performing more than one task at a time, then you are making yourself exhausted and you won't be able to complete a single task.

Social media marketing allows a company to reach out to prospects on a personal level to create a deeper relationship through content and entertainment.

What makes this one stand out: It is Marvel's first RPG game for the smartphone.Trailer gives first glimpseAt the beginning of March, Marvel Games and Netmarble officially announced the new project and paired this announcement with a first trailer. Although a release date for the RPG has not yet been set, the trailer offers a glimpse into the game experience. Captain America and Spider-Man are joined by Captain Marvel and Doctor Strange to fight Super Villains, as also reported by Vodafone.de. Scenes in Xandearth, Sakaar and Co. are likely to be quite recognisable to fans of the films and comics, and the slow-motion effects during the fights are also reminiscent of the already well-established Superhero filmography. The producers of the game deliberately refer to familiar stylistic devices, locations and characters to appeal to fans.Players are allowed to add a personal touch to the familiar world at the same time. Not only do gamers now have the crucial responsibility of deciding the outcome of the game and the story ending with skilful gaming skills. They can also customise the appearance of the characters - and it is precisely this option that adds to the game's appeal. The trailer shows Spider-Man in a denim jacket as well as a golden outfit, Captain Marvel wears glasses and an Iron-Man-like superhero suit. The variety of these upgrades is only hinted at so far and will only be fully unlocked in the longer course of the game.Why on the smartphone?It is no coincidence that Marvel is now focusing on an action RPG for the smartphone. With Marvel Future Revolution, the developers are part of a larger trend towards mobile gaming. Minecraft, for example, has long been found not only on PCs and consoles, but also on smartphones. The player feedback on Play.google.com is positive, and meanwhile players get more game options on mobile devices than on the PC: the multiplayer mode, for example, is only updated on the smartphone. Similarly, slot games like Avatar: Gateway Guardians and Holy Diver are also available on mobile. According to  smartphone adaptation is a must in today's established casinos. These can directly address the expectations of today's players and stand out from potential competitors thanks to good implementation. These examples show that the smartphone plays a role in gaming that should not be underestimated for game developers. Marvel Games and Netmarbel are therefore very consciously focusing on a device that is becoming increasingly important. Marvel fans are not exempt from this trend.Marvel Future Revolution does not yet have a release date, but is already scoring points with fans of the Marvel universe and the gaming industry. With a combination of the familiar - familiar places, characters, cinematic stylistic devices - and personal touches, the RTP game offers a new experience in a familiar world. At the same time, developers opted for a smartphone game, thus following a highly topical trend in the gaming industry. The game concept seems well thought-out - fans now only have to wait for the release.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/entertainment/marvel-future-revolution-marvel-rpg-soon-available-for-smartphones.html"},

Reducing the environmental footprint of building with  is important as the building sector contributes 40% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

These professionals must adhere to the minimal building codes. The local environment is one of key aspects that affect the building resilience. For eg. Some cities are more concerned with hurricanes, while the others are concerned with earthquakes.Building Design PrinciplesWith the right strategies, sustainability and resilient design can go hand in hand. While analyzing the operating conditions, the design engineers can specify measures that improve both aspects. For example, using renewable energy can help buildings reduce emissions as well as becoming less dependent on the local power grid.A  must take all the typical conditions, to which the building is exposed, into thorough consideration.

Sustainable architecture involves incorporating building designs, including structural and MEP systems, that promote environmental conservation and sustainability. Some other terms like green design, eco-design and eco-friendly architecture aim for the same goal of promoting eco-friendly environment.Some key aspects of sustainable architecture are:Architects, specializing in green design, are constantly looking for ways to promote eco-friendly environment in buildings, without hindering with the functions of the building elements.Let’s look at some of the promising technologies and building materials that can be used in sustainable architecture.Solar ShinglesAs we all know, solar panels are one of the best ways to save energy and reduce power bills.  combines solar panels and roof shingles for serving as a power source. Unlike solar panels that are laid of top of the roof, solar shingles are a part of the roof that feed the required amount of energy to the building. Solar shingles are wired and connected to the electrical systems of the building. With optimal orientation of solar shingles, the electricity consumption can be minimized due to maximum sunlight powering the solar shingles.In some cases, solar shingles can also act as a source of extra income. In such cases, the solar array produces more energy than the building energy requirement. Utility companies can buy the excess power from the building owners. The energy is distributed to other users through the electric grid. Solar shingles are more expensive than solar panels, but energy savings will eventually cut off the extra expenses and prove to be a cost saving option in the long run.Green RoofsA green roof or rooftop garden is building roof space that hosts a variety of plants, trees and grass. Green roods not only help lowering the temperature of the entire building, but also improves the outdoor air quality. The ability to improve the air quality is why green roofs are often considered as “urban lungs” in cities. They also serve as a habitat for animals and birds.For installing a green roof, the following steps should be followed:Green roofs add a considerable weight so they must be considered during the building structural design. It is recommended to consult and word with a contractor with experience in green buildings for correct installation.Rainwater Harvesting allows building owners to reduce the water consumption by a great amount, especially for irrigating landscapes and gardens. Most of the architects include rainwater harvesting in their green building designs since it is a fairly simple application. Rainwater harvesting reduces runoffs, i.e. excess water of the land surface, and also helps preventing overflow in sewage systems.Rainwater collecting systems can be simple and complex. Simple rainwater harvesting systems can be containers or barrels strategically placed to collect water, and complex systems can be pervious concrete or array of fountains.Some research is recommended before opting for rainwater collecting systems. In some areas rainwater harvesting isn’t allowed in the local laws and opting for systems that are not compliant would create issues for the building owners. Rainwater is also often considered as greywater so special permits may be required in some cities for using rainwater.CobCob house building is an ancient building technique. Cob houses utilizes a mix of wet earth and straw which are molded into brick-like pieces or cobs. The mixture consistence is very similar to that of clay, and can be used to create uniquely shaped houses. Builders use the cob mix to mold the walls by hand into smooth structures instead of sharp edges and angles. Cob houses normally have built-in features like shelves, tables, couches and other furniture types as well.Since cob is made from natural materials, cob houses have extremely low carbon footprint as compared to building made using concrete and masonry. Since mud and straw are easily available at construction sites, the transportation and manufacturing cost requirements are minimum.Shipping ContainersThere’s a growing trend of making beautiful, compact and habitable homes utilizing unusual structures. Shipping containers is one of the growing trends that has caught a lot of attention. Along with old shipping container, other prefabricated structures can also be use for creating homes. These containers can also be equipped with MEP and HVAC systems as well.Similar to cob buildings, shipping containers have a very low environmental impact and are cheap.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/environment/the-elements-of-sustainable-architecture.html"},

As you know there is a huge selection of engineers, each specializes in a specific field. The petrol engineers specialize in the making of petrol and handling oil and natural gas.They are making sure that the right type of oil is getting extracted from the oil fields to make petrol. And, they are considering the sustainability of oil and gas.The meaning of sustainability with petrolWe all know that with things like oil and gas, there is just a limit that we have. And, if we have reached that limit, we will not be able to make petrol anymore by using oil and gas. This is why it is important to increase the sustainability of oil and gas by petrol engineers. In short, it means that we should preserve as much oil and gas as possible, and this is the petrol engineers that are responsible for it.These are the three ways that petrol engineers can improve the sustainability of oil and gas.Optimize field operationsThey should find ways on how to optimize field operations. To ensure that all the oil on the oil fields is being used and to save as much oil as possible. To make sure that all companies and industries are making safe and affordable energy without wasting any of the oil and gas that is limited.This is one of the biggest challenges that these engineers have. To make sure that all field operations are used completely and to ensure that nothing goes to waste.Prevent spills in the oil fieldsNo matter how hard they try, oil spills are always happening in the oil fields. And, this is the responsibility of the petrol engineers to find a way to prevent spills from happening.We all know the condition of the oil, and how precious the oil is that we have. Each year, the oil is getting less and less. And, it is their responsibility to try to reduce as much oil spills as possible. So that most of the oil that they found can be collected and use, without spilling anyone of it.Reduce methane gas from leakingAnother energy source that the petrol engineer is responsible for is methane gas. And, they need to make sure that it isn’t leaking any gas. Not only can the gas be dangerous when it leaks into the air, but it is a waste of gas that could have been used a lot better.The gas can be used to make energy. And, if the gas is leaking, it is a waste that will never be recovered. The worst part is that the gas isn’t visible, so without the petrol engineer, it will not even be visible to the eye. And no one will see that the gas is leaking.We don’t really think about the Sustainability of energy sources and the Role of Petrol Engineers to reserve as much of it as possible.

Any business would be wise to consider the following reasons for hiring a sanitization company.COVID-19 OutbreaksIt’s more necessary than ever for companies to ensure areas are properly sanitized. Biohazardous materials, even as small as drops of spit, can pose serious threats to public health in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is especially crucial to confirm that areas are perfectly sanitized following a COVID-19 outbreak at a workplace, residence, or other area, and hiring a sanitization company is the most important way companies can get this job done the correct way to keep the public safe.Professional TrainingA sanitization or biohazardous waste removal company will know exactly how to clean up safely and effectively from any situations that could result in health risks. Training and CDC approval are absolutely essential in biohazardous cleanup, as untrained individuals will often cause themselves and others injury or infection due to their lack of knowledge and experience regarding appropriate sanitization efforts.Efficient WorkIn addition to effectiveness and safety, professional sanitization companies also offer much greater efficiency to their clients. Many companies waste their time and money struggling to sanitize an area themselves, however those who hire a sanitization company can rest assured that their area will be sanitized properly in a shorter amount of time, costing them much less in the long run.Reassure Employees and ConsumersConsumers and employees will likely become anxious returning to the site of an outbreak or other biohazardous threat if not treated with care. A wise business understands their employee and consumer concerns, and wants them to be at ease. A company cannot profit if their consumers and employees refuse to enter the area, and will possibly receive greater backlash online if the right protocols are not taken to ensure public health safety.Hiring a sanitization company will give the public the reassurance they need that a company is safe, which allows the company to continue with profits and business as usual.Personal Removal From ThreatsCompanies are also advised to hire a professional sanitization or biohazard removal company because it removes themselves and their employees from the equation. Not only could remaining on site or trying to clean up biohazards themselves be extremely dangerous to the health of those working, the company could face lawsuits should any uninsured person become injured or infected as a result. Any accidents would not reflect well on the company’s media image or profits, so hiring sanitization professionals is the smart choice.Overall, there are many reasons to hire a sanitization company, especially following an outbreak of COVID-19 or other biohazardous situation. A company should benefit from the professional training, efficiency, reassurance, and personal removal a sanitization service can offer them, and doing so is the responsible choice for their business to make.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/environment/reasons-to-hire-a-sanitization-company.html"},

In most cases, it happens by accident, but it can also happen on purpose, because of neglect or because of modern technology that is leaving radioactive waste. These are some of the most common causes of radioactive pollution that is leaving the danger of our environment and to our health.The effects of radioactive pollutionA question that we are getting a lot is if radioactive waste and pollution are really as serious as what people are making it. The answer is yes. It isn’t just serious; it is dangerous and life-threatening.It can have devastating results in nature, animals, human health, etc. Every living thing can have serious problems when getting into contact with radioactive waste.The main problem is that when humans are getting into contact with radioactive waste, it changes the human’s DNA.

It will help you to determine whether your plants thrive, or call it quits. But have you ever wondered, what is the best time to water your indoor plants? Well, that’s a great question.In your plant’s natural habitats, they’re watered naturally whenever Mother Nature wants to water them. Yes, it can rain at any time of the day outside. But inside, where you’re in control, morning is an ideal time to water your houseplants like bonsai plants. Here’s some sorted fact from fiction about the best time to water plants. Watering Plants in MorningEvery gardener out there wants their plants to thrive and look their best. And yet sometimes it can be tedious to know the right and the best thing to do to keep your indoor plants looking their best. And yet if you think about it a little, it surely makes sense that watering plants in the morning are the best strategy.

At the morning time of the day, plants like bonsai tree are ready to absorb plenty of water, and good hydration helps your plant withstand all through the day. Watering before 10 am is perfect because it helps the water seep into the plant substantially.Watering plants in the morning is great, but only if the soil can absorb what you’re applying. Instead of drenching things faster and quickly, try a slower stream if you’re using a hose. Get the blooming plants at your doorstep on the same day via same day delivery offered by some online plant nurseries.Watering Plants in the afternoonEspecially when the sky is clear and the sun is right at its peak, watering indoor plants in the afternoon is not a good idea. It results in an adverse effect on the growth of plants. But if you forget to water your plants in the morning and plan to water your houseplants later in the day, water them in the late afternoon when the burning sun is not at its peak. This will help your indoor or medicinal plants to absorb water before the nightfall and will not affect their growth in any way.You can find a wide variety of indoor  through some online plant nurseries. In the summer season, you can always water your houseplants in the evening. Many sun-loving vegetables, container-grown, and outdoor potted flowering shrubs need to be watered twice a day.Watering Plants at Night Isn’t NeededMost indoor plants don’t need additional care by watering them at night and this idea has been around for years. There are a few exceptions, but 99% of your indoor houseplants should only be watered during the day. If you’re feeling sad about leaves burning in the scorching sun at noon, make sure to water the roots of the plants instead of casting a wide spray across things. You can also find beautiful bloom gifts online like African velvet to your loved one. Nighttime watering plants promote disease, and no one wants to deal with that now. Try early morning or late afternoon or early evening watering for the most absorption.Final WordsThese are the best times to water your indoor plants that result in increased growth of your plant.

It is tough to differentiate them. Most of the rays have flat disc-like bodies and a long whip-like tail withy their eyes on the top of their heads and their mouths and gills on their bellies. Let’s look at the 10 listed different types of rays.  The Oceanic Manta Ray is the largest species of rays found in the world. They can grow at least 23ft from one wingtip to another wingtip and can weigh up to 4000pounds. They live approximately 400ft deep in the warm tropical waters across the world.Each Ocean Manta Ray has its unique pattern of markings on their backs in large black and white. The main distinguishing feature of these giant marine animals is their horns located either side of their huge mouths, which are used to funnel planktons.Ocean Manta Rays have a lifespan of about 15-20 years and are usually hunted by Sharks and Killer Whales.   The Reef Manta Ray is the second largest species of rays in the world. They can grow their wings up to 14ft approximately. They are often referred to as ‘Birds of the Sea’ because their two triangular pectoral fins look like wings of a bird. They have a small dorsal fin on their upper body, which can be mistaken for a dolphin or a shark from the surface of the ocean.Reef Manta Ray are commonly of black or dark grey colour with a white underside. Like Ocean Manta, Reef Manta Rays also feed on planktons.These rays are a vulnerable species found in the tropical waters of the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans around islands and atolls.   The Spotted Eagle Rays are beautiful creatures with a unique pattern of white spots on their dark blue upper bodies, which swim near the surfaces in large groups. They can approximately grow up to 10ft wide. They can be easily distinguishable because of their long, board snout and friendly faces.Eagle Rays have a plate-like mouth that allows them to prey their favourite foods like molluscs, crustaceans, and worms. They are found in the warm and temperate waters. They can swim long distances across open water to migrate seasonally with their strong swimming ability.   The Devil Ray species are widespread around the Mediterranean and the eastern Atlantic to the Indian Ocean and western Pacific.Devil Rays and Reef Manta are often mistaken for one another because of their similar shape, colour, and size. But looked on very carefully, the Devil Ray is more pointer than Manta. Devil Rays’ are narrower and their cephalic fins or horns pointing forward while the Manta Rays have curled around their mouths.Devil Rays are fantastic divers and are one of the fastest marine species in the world. They are also great acrobats as they often flip and jump out of the water.Despite their name, the Devil Rays are a shy creature which feeds on planktons and krill.   The Blue Spotted Sting Ray is relatively smaller in size with about an average disc size of around 12”. They are also known as Ribbontail Ray. They are found in the tropical waters throughout the Indo-Pacific region.Blue Spotted Sting Ray has a flattened body with a light mustard colour and bright blue spots. Due to their attractive colours, they are often collected in the aquariums.These rays are shy around humans and swim away in the presence of any divers. They have two venomous spines covered with their long tails, that can give off a painful sting.They feed on molluscs, crustaceans and small fish found on coral reefs.   The Pelagic String Rays look like any average ray fish and are found flying around the open ocean. Like Manta and Eagle, the Pelagic prefer temperate waters and swim across the world.Their wingspan can be from 2ft to 4ft. But their whip-like stringing tail is double the length of their bodies. They have a wedge-shaped disc of deep purple or dark blue colour with particularly small eyes.Pelagic String Rays feed on krill, eat jellyfish, squid and small fish. With their pectoral fins, Pelagic String Rays can directly prey into their mouth by using their sharp and pointed teeth.   This type of rays can produce an electric shock from two-shaped electronic organs on their back. They only have a few natural predators because of their electronic shock mechanism. They can produce between 8 to 220 volts of electricity.Electric Ray is found near muddy or sandy seafloor where it hides. They are known to be aggressive and even chase divers. Their most potent shock can unconscious a human.Electric Ray can grow up to a length of 1 to 6ft. They have smooth skin with a circular body and have a shorter and thicker tail. Even the tail has three pectoral fins to stand upright. They have tiny eyes and depend on their electroreceptors to detect preys like Halibut, Herrings, and Worms.   The Southern String Rays are found in the subtropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean and in the Cayman Islands. Unlike other rays, Southern Rat Fish are not scared of people and curiously swim right up to the humans.They have flat diamond-shaped bodies with a dark brown or grey upper body. They grow from 2ft to 4ft and have sharp tails of twice their length. They are famous for their poisonous tail.Southern String Ray remain buried in the sand to hunt preys like shellfish, shrimp and crabs.   This beautiful ray species is mostly found in the warm coastal waters and often buried in the muddy seabeds of bays.Just like a butterfly, they also have the shape of a flat disc, wider than its length. Their wingspan is about 4.5ft with attractive patterns of white and dark swirls and dots over a grey or dark green base. They have a small non-venomous tail.They feed on invertebrates and small fish.   The Shark Ray is officially known as the Bowmouth Guitarfish. They are found on the muddy seabeds around the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific.Their colour fades as they grow old from very dark to light brown or taupe colour with pretty white spots. They can grow up to 9ft.They have pectoral fins and nape covered with tiny sharp thorns used for protection. They use their strong ridged teeth for hunting preys like lobster and shrimp.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/environment/types-of-ray-fish.html"},

Recently, a Harvard study revealed that COVID-19 mortality increases in regions with high levels of air pollutants. When we read the term “Air Pollution”, we tend to think about air pollution associated with traffic. However, there a much bigger source of emission that gets overlooked. The transportation sector accounts for 28% of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, while the building sector contributes for 40%.Building emissions are mainly categorized into 2 types, direct emission and indirect emission. Diesel generators and natural gas boilers account for the direct emission while the electricity consumption from power plants that burn fossil fuels account for the indirect emissions. Reducing air pollution with effective energy efficiency methods is proving to play a vital role in building sector. When buildings improve their energy efficiency, all the emissions are collectively reduced to a great extent.Importance of an Energy AuditEnergy audit is systematic collection and analysis of energy data which is used for identifying both, where and how the energy is used, and also the potential for saving energy. Optimal combination of energy efficiency measures varies for different properties depending upon the consumption profile. The best starting point is to opt for a  which will allow the building owners to understand the financial returns of all the potential upgrades beforehand. This will also help owners to avoid measures that might not be suitable or effective for the building.The audit provides 2 critical pieces of information:Generally, upgrading boilers and old furnaces running on heating oil can help achieve the best results. This reduces the heating cost as well as the emission per BTU (British Thermal Unit). Upgrading building heating systems can be costly but the energy bills overtime would eventually offset the cost while ensuring environmental profits.Depending upon the building location, emission reduction may help qualify for a clean energy grant or a low interest loan. Properties over 25,000 sq. ft. in New York will be subject to emission reduction law starting from 2024.Switching Energy Sources to Cut EmissionsEnergy emissions are considerably cut down when buildings switch to energy efficient measures. In US as of 2020, building owners can claim 26% federal tax credit for renewable energy investment after switching to . Switching from oil fired boilers and furnaces to natural gas fired units will lower the emissions per BTU of heat delivered.Building owner also have an option of going 100% electric and eliminating site emissions by using high efficiency heat pumps. In case of indirect emissions, fossil fuels dominate the power grid and concentrating emission at a power plant is still preferred over directly emitting them in cities. However, indirect emissions can be reduced automatically with building electrification if the local grid starts using a greater share of renewable energy.For a better understanding, assume a building uses 100,000 kW-hours per month where the power grid produces 0.8 kg on CO2 equivalent per kWh. In this case, indirect emissions are 80,000 kg CO2 eq per month. But, if the grid reduces the emission intensity to 0.6 kg CO2 eq per kWh, the indirect emissions are automatically lowered to 60,000 kg per month.Now using electricity for space heating and hot water may not feasible for some buildings but, switching from heating oil to natural gas may cut down the emissions by almost 50%. What that means is that energy expenses and greenhouse gases (GHG) can both be reduced simultaneously with energy efficiency.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/environment/how-building-energy-efficiency-helps-improve-the-air-quality-in-cities.html"},

What is there is a simple solution to improve your mental performance, increase your energy levels, and reduce the signs of aging?  Well, with NAD IV Infusion therapy you can do just that.This anti-aging therapy can produce needed results by increasing your body’s NAD+ levels. Find out below what NAD is, what NAD+ benefits you can expect, and where you can find the best NAD therapy in Chicago.Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD+) is a natural coenzyme of niacin (Vitamin B3). It is found in every cell of your body. NAD+ is a compound that  other enzymes function. Enzymes, in turn, are responsible for thousands of vital bodily processes from your metabolism to cognition.So without NAD+, your body cannot perform some of its most basic functions. And this is exactly what happens as you age. Your natural NAD+ levels drop, slowing down some of these processes. Raising your NAD+ levels can counter this decline.

So let’s move on to the actual NAD therapy and treatment options.The IV in NAD IV infusion stands for intravenous. This method produces the best and fastest results. Although NAD+ supplements and pills are available as well, they usually poorly absorbed and do not provide the same quick and effective benefits that you can expect from NAD IV infusion.By receiving NAD+ intravenously it doesn’t have to go through your digestive system first for your cells to absorb it. As such, none of the NAD+ is lost and your body retains as much NAD+ as possible. With an NAD IV infusion treatment, your NAD levels replenish immediately and therefore improve your outcome.Not only does IV treatment provide the best results, but it’s also completely safe. Once you’ve chosen a reputable clinic (like the NAD therapy Chicago-based clinic mentioned below) you will receive expert consultation and the therapy will be performed by board-certified medical professionals.

Packing is hard enough for adults, but the disruption for kids can be very challenging. Do your best to keep them looking forward and being excited about their new space. Use pictures of your new home and images of your new city to increase your child's excitement about the process.As you get closer to the moving date, take the time to zone your house. You will always need access to a kitchen, but can you switch to paper plates and pack up most of your dishes early to reduce your labor as you get closer to the moving date? Seasonal clothing and holiday decorations can also be secured, taped up and stacked for easy loading. Set up a wall in the master bedroom where you can stack boxes. Don't put this wall of boxes in a space where small children can get to it. You don't want your efforts undone by a little person unpacking what you've already put up, and the risk of tipping is always a risk. As you pack. label each box on two perpendicular sides so you can easily see what's in there.Free boxes are likely to be structurally stressed; they've already been used and may not be sturdy enough for stacking. If you can possibly afford it, use a  that allows you to order more boxes as you need them. Avoid buying very large boxes if you're going to be loading the truck on your own; the bigger the box, the more you have to lift. Take care to mark each box twice. If you're moving into a house with multiple bedrooms, assign numbers to each box or invest in some colored dots that you can tape on the box beside the label. When you get to your new house, assign a color to each room so the movers know where to put the boxes.Work with movers who know what they're doing. If possible, try to find a company that's known for moving fine art and/or pianos. Anyone who can safely move a piano has the lift power, the hauling power and the care to move your family treasures and electronics. Find a realtor who's either a parent or very knowledgeable of your new city so you are sure you're close to the best schools. The simplest things, such as making sure the window treatments in your new home have safe cords, will be easier with professional connections who are keeping an eye out for you and your family.Make sure that every person who's moving has their own . Inside this bag, packThis luggage style packing means that everyone can have a bath, clean pajamas, clean sheets, and their own pillow when you get to your new home. If your kids need car toys, pack these in a tote bag and stow them in the footwell of the family vehicle you'll be moving in. For those packing and moving with very small children, plan to pack the nursery last and unpack it first. Finally, do not plan to move children in a moving truck; while these vehicles will have a seat belt, they may not be safe for a child seat.For families that travel with a lot of electronics, put all the chargers in one computer bag and bungee this bag to one of the suitcases in use by an adult so everything can get charged up when you arrive at your new home. Make sure that the electronics that your children need to travel are well charged on moving day and that everyone has a carrying bag or a quality case for their tablet, toy or tool.Moving during a pandemic is stressful enough without having to panic about whether your movers know what they're doing. Build a relationship with skilled, professional movers that will treat your belongings with respect and care. Buy good quality boxes and color code or label everything before you tape it up.

If you get that right and follow our various tips, you'll recover from training much snappier. Accordingly, true to form, you will see better results and wind up astounding your activity targets instead of coming up short.", "word-count": 1204, "body": "It looks good that the more you work out, the fitter you will be. Essentially, nevertheless, a great deal of action without sufficiently recovering from your activity can incite injury, which can adjust the health gets you've made. Moreover, by recovery, we aren't just examining rest. There's significantly more to recovery than rest, and we have to help you with showing up at your health goals as quickly and as safely as possible by giving you 10 unique approaches to recover from an activity snappier.Pre-practice headwayIt may give off an impression of being odd that our first tip concerning how you can recover snappier after exercise is connected to improving your body before you in any event, starting working out. Be that as it may, by taking the ideal proportions of pre-practice supplements, you can diminish how much your body fatigues both during and after exercise. We recommend looking for things containing Citrulline Malate just as Magnesium and taking them around 30 minutes before training for best results.BroadeningAfter you've stunned yourself with a massive exercise, we understand that expanding may be the specific inverse thing you have to do. Regardless, it's fundamental to convey the lactic destruction that creates when you train for so long with confined oxygen and kick off the framework to your muscles again. This supports muscle recovery and will help you with feeling fresher when you hit another activity the next day. Endeavor to expand the muscles you've started most during exercise – lower backs, hamstrings, and shoulders are particularly disposed to getting tight, in any case, endeavor to tailor your stretching out a framework to your own activity.Protein powderWe comprehend what you'll state here, 'you're a protein  association, clearly, you'll train us to take protein powder'. That is legitimate, yet taking the ideal proportions of significant worth protein powder inside 30 minutes of action can be critical for recovery, yet moreover for building muscle without expanding fat. For best results, we propose taking Whey Isolate or better, since this for the most part contains less sugar/fat and a more prominent measure of the protein you need to recover faster.Okay, by and by for a bit of inappropriate self-progression. While protein shakes are a straightforward technique to add more protein to your eating routine, it's critical not to confine the clinical favorable circumstances by using an unobtrusive shaker. By placing assets into a ShakeSphere Tumbler, you dodge risky microorganisms since there will never be any disaster area and it's so common to clean. Moreover, at the same time, you'll watch unimaginable and stand separated from the gathering in light of the authorized holder plan of our activity bottles.HydrationAfter a hard exercise, it's fundamental to displace lost body fluids by hydrating whatever amount as could sensibly be normal. Despite how much water you drink during exercise, it can never hinder drying out completely. Notwithstanding, more than that, you lose a huge load of body fluids and salt when you sweat, and this should be replaced to energize faster recovery. It is accordingly that water isn't adequate in isolation. You need to add electrolytes to your refreshment to quicken the re-hydration measure, else you will feel more depleted for the rest of the day and won't have the alternative to plan as hard the next day.Focused eating scheduleSomething past a strong eating schedule, you need a connection with your eating routine if you have to recover as fast as could sensibly be normal. Endeavor to plan meals early and, if possible, plan what you'll eat after exercise before you start. Something different, there's a tendency to eat comfort food or eat too long after your activity (2 hours should be quite far). Present exercise meals should essentially contain carbs and protein. Carbs are especially crucial after exercise which suffers more than an hour, in that they replace lost glycogen, while protein will help fix and build up the muscles you've arranged. Results of the dirt will moreover help you with feeling less depleted and, clearly, are critical to a sound and changed eating routine even more all around.Supplement upgradesThere is a huge load of supplement upgrades out there that you don't generally need as you'll consistently have enough of them in your eating routine starting at now. That being expressed, there are a couple of improvements available both in tablet and powder structure which we would recommend – specifically, BCAAs and Creatine. BCAAs, speaking to Branched-Chain Amino Acids, have been tentatively exhibited to create muscle, decay muscle depletion, and moderate muscle disturbance. Endeavor to get your estimations in when an activity. Creatine, in the meantime, is particularly feasible for power-based games like weightlifting and running. In case you're not doing these games, we apparently would incite against taking Creatine, anyway the recovery it restores after short-burst practice is unparalleled.WeightWearing weight pieces of clothing is a basic strategy for diminishing exacerbation in your muscles both during and after exercise. Weight works by narrowing your veins, convincing blood to stream speedier and even more satisfactorily up to your heart which, along these lines, siphons oxygen-rich blood back to your pulsating muscles. The best part is that you don't have to accomplish something other than wearing the weighted clothing; you can even have it on underneath your common pieces of clothing at work or while getting out and about.DetoxificationBy detoxification, we are taking a gander at having a shower with the right 'trimmings' added to it. Adding ice to an infection shower is an outstanding technique for getting the body to recover faster after an activity, and it obviously works, yet we fathom that it is definitely not an engaging decision for a large number of individuals. Taking everything into account, we endorse adding Epsom Salt to a hot shower. Epsom Salt is a characteristic compound containing Magnesium Sulfate and it is a splendid home treatment for loosening firm joints and extricating very close muscles. Retain a shower of Epsom Salt for 20 minutes, don't wash it off, and you'll wind up inclination better recovered inside several hours.BackrubGetting a back rub on the night preceding your step by step rest day can be particularly convincing at diminishing conceded muscle bothering. The aggravation of your muscles will encourage, your circulatory system will improve, and your muscles will feel less close. Getting a back rub at the ideal time (inside 2-6 hours of activity) can suggest that you feel particularly more revived when you come to hit one more week's arrangement block, so it's irrefutably an advantageous hypothesis. If it is definitely not a sensible option for you cost-wise, you can by and large get a foam roller and back rub your muscles that way.RestingUltimately, the rest. Rest ought to never be considered as indivisible from unwinding. The total of the tips we've given so far is immaterial if you don't lay enough on ordinary consistently. We understand it will in general be outrageous in the hurrying about of present-day life, yet between 7-9 hours of rest genuinely improves muscle recovery through protein association and human advancement hormone release. That suggests you'll be fit as a fiddle when you get up close to the start of the day, allowing you to show up at your greatest limit.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/fitness/10-ways-to-recover-from-a-workout-faster-with-shaker-bottle.html"},
{"heading": "In House or Outsourced Medical Billing - Which Model Is Right For Your Practice?", "author": "Albano Fidel Cafe", "description": "Choosing between in-house billing or outsourced medical billing staff is one of the most financially influential decisions a medical practice has to make.", "word-count": 1202, "body": "However, if you are a medical practice and not sure which system will work best for you, this article will help you understand both of them in-depth and make an informed decision.In House Medical BillingProsMore Oversight of Day-to-Day OperationsHaving an in-house billing department provides you with direct control and oversight over the financial operations and processes. You can physically reach your staff at any time and get quick feedback on any queries. Plus, in-house staff will also implement any instructions you pass on right away. Strict in-person oversight of your finances will lead to greater transparency in your operations.In-house billing is a suitable option for if you are reluctant to relinquish control of your billing processes to a third party.  FlexibilityWhen you have a dedicated in-house billing team, you can make your own rules. Contrarily, when you outsource a third-party billing company, you will be locked by rules in line with the contract you will sign off with them.High ROISince you manage every little billing process of your practice on your own, it would be easy for you to keep your cost under check. Needless to say, greater cost control will maximize your return on investment (ROI). ConsHigher Costs The costs for in-house medical billing is certainly too high than outsourced billing because you will have to spend money on recruitment, infrastructure and software etc. LiabilitiesLiabilities are likely to increase when you have an in-house team to manage your business processes, particularly your billers aren’t aware of the repercussions of HIPPA privacy and PHI security violations. You will have to ensure that your billers are not discarding any superbills or ignoring encounter forms to minimize the possibility of claim rejection.When your billing operations are outsourced, liabilities on your side will be lesser.Support IssuesAnother key issue for having an in-house medical billing team is supporting. If you operate a small practice, you have to rely on one or two billers to manage your billing operations. As your practice grows, you will need more resources to manage a bigger client base.Additionally, when even one of your billers gets sick, goes on vacation, or quits the job, the cash flow of your practice can be stalled, which will seriously affect your profitability.Outsourced billers, on the other hand, are contractually obliged to ensure consistency in the billing operations all year round. Outsourced Medical BillingProsAccuracy Most of the medical billing service providers have extensive experience and experts who receive constant training to stay on top of current medical coding requirements and advancements within the industry. They handle hundreds of claims on a regular basis and know exactly what it takes to get the payment done seamlessly.On the other hand, when you decide to go with in-house billing team, the first challenge will be to find and recruit qualified individuals. Another flipside of in-house billing is that if the size of the team is small, the likelihood of errors will be high.Since outsourced billing providers have a bigger team, they can handle a wide variety of medical claims and ensure an optimum level of accuracy. Productivity Medical practice practitioners are busy in taking care of their patients; they don’t have time to recruit, train, and manage an in-house staff and monitor track their billing operations. Outsourcing your billing to a third-party frees up time and resources for you and enables you to spend more time with your patients and work towards achieving your professional goals.Reduced Office Management CostsOutsourcing billing operations to a third-party helps medical practices save the expenses of in-house start-up costs, staff salaries and benefits, software and equipment. The standard billing rates of outsourced billing companies are much more affordable than the in-house setup. Most of the medical companies offer a flexible pricing structure and usually charge only a very small percentage (usually between 5-10 per cent) of the total revenue of your practice.Since medical billing companies know that they will get paid when you get paid, they work with extreme dedication and diligence to ensure that you earn maximum reimbursements. Faster Claim Submission  The extensive experience and expertise of outsourced companies allow them to submit claims more quickly and reliably than in-house billers. Accurate claim processing, AR follow up, and payment collection helps the practice to maintain a steady cash flow.Plus, outsourced billers can also mend any rejected claims quickly and efficiently to help the practices get their money as soon as possible. In-house medical billing, on the other hand, poses a risk of low claim success rates, which can be seriously threatening to your cash flow and the overall health of your business. ConsLess OversightWhen you hire a third-party billing service provider, you will have less direct control over the management of your billing processes. For example, if you have any questions about insurance claims or have any instructions to pass on, you will have to schedule a phone call with your provider. Additionally, by outsourcing your medical billing processes off-premises, you won’t get enough knowledge about how claims are handled. Communication to PatientsAnother issue with outsourcing your medical billing operations is that you do not have access to the billing records of your patients. Therefore, if a patient has a question related to insurance or billing, you will need to communicate with the billing service provider. Setting up a communication protocol with your service provider is an effective way to prevent any frustration.Variable CostsAnother disadvantage of outsourcing your billing processes is that the costs may fluctuate widely between slow and busy months, which makes it different for the medical practices to budget their monthly expenses. Possibility of Shut DownIf the medical billing company shuts down its operations due to less number of projects or any other reason, your billing processes and cash flow will be hindered until you find an alternative immediately. Hidden FeesMost of medical billing services providers look for avenues to make more money. In a bid to increase their revenue, they may try to add some type of hidden fees. To prevent such a situation, it is advisable for you to read any contract carefully before you sign it off.  Final WordsBoth in-house medical billing and outsourced medical billing have their sets of pros and cons. You will need to take into account several factors like age and size of your business, and state of the finances of your practice and choose the best way to go. Since handling billing, in-house can be complex, expensive and overwhelming, more and more healthcare providers today prefer to outsource their billing to bring simplicity and ease to the everyday life of their practice. The flipsides of outsourced billing are minimal when you choose the right medical billing company.If you decide to go outsource your billing operations off-premises, make sure that the company you choose is experienced, knowledgeable, upfront about its prices and has a strong client base. Medical Billing Experts, You Can Trust USA is a full-service revenue cycle management company serving a multitude of healthcare providers throughout the United States for over a decade now.  We provide medical practices with greater control of their billing through support for each phase of their revenue cycle management, allowing them to focus on their core job of taking care of and maximize their revenue stream.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/fitness/in-house-or-outsourced-medical-billing-which-model-is-right-for-your-practice.html"},

{"heading": "Interest Rate vs. Factor Rate – The Difference", "author": "Bauer Jack", "description": "This post about The Difference between Interest Rate vs Factor Rate, here you will find about what are factor rates and interest rates. How factor rates and interest rate are Calculated? What Factors do Lenders Consider When Determining Your Factor and Interest Rate?", "word-count": 722, "body": "Today, there are a wide variety of funding options available to small and medium-sized businesses. From traditional bank loans and lines of credit to invoice financing and working capital loans, it’s easy to find and compare various loan options to meet your financial needs and budget. One reliable way to choose the best small business financing is to compare the overall cost of the loan. To determine how much you’ll have to repay in total for your borrowed amount you need to look into the interest rate vs. factor rate. Many small business owners are familiar with the term  or simply interest rates but certain types of business loans represent the cost of funding in the form of a factor rate. So if you’re planning to apply for a small business loan, it’s significant to know the difference between the two. In this blog post, we’ll explain what makes both different from each other and why every small business owner should care. What Are Factor Rates?The factor rate is expressed in a decimal form and not in the percentages the way interest rates are calculated. These rates usually range from 1.09 to 1.47. Similar to interest rates, this signifies how much you’re going to pay to obtain funding.Factors rates are most commonly used in short-term business financing like a Merchant Cash Advance, where repayment terms are very short, typically daily or weekly. Factors rates are rarely used in the small business funding space, but they are not difficult to calculate. What Are Interest Rates  The interest rate is one of the most common ways to signify the total amount (interest + principal) you would pay throughout the loan tenure. You’ve probably heard about this term since it's how the most personal and business loans are priced. This is expressed as an annual percentage rate (APR) and is used for credit cards, home mortgages, and traditional business loans such as an SBA loan, term loan, line of credit, or equipment financing.How Factor Rates Are Calculated?Calculating your factor rate is not as difficult as it seems, you get the total amount by simply multiplying your borrowed amount by the factor rate.For Example:Principal Amount – $10,000Factor Rate – 1.25Term – 18 monthsTotal Repayment - $12,500Daily Payment - $265Weekly Payment - $173 How Interest Rates Are Calculated?The method of calculating the interest rate is somehow a little complicated. However, the most sought-after small business financing options involve charging fixed or variable interest on a set of percentages of the remaining principal at defined, regular intervals. Here is the general formula to calculate interest on your loan amount:Principal Loan Amount x Interest Rate x Time (aka Number of Years in Term) = InterestFor ExampleLoan Amount – $500,000Interest Rate (APR) – 7%Loan Term – 10 YearsTotal Repayment – $850,000Monthly Payment - $7083 What Factors do Lenders Consider When Determining Your Factor and Interest Rate?Factor Rate Interest Rate   Which One is Better For You Small Business?The greatest factors in determining which rate is best for your small business are the type of business financing you need, creditworthiness, or how soon you need capital. Short-term business loans such as invoicing financing and Merchant Cash Advance with factor rates are great for entrepreneurs who don’t have ideal credit score and collateral to put up but need immediate cash to run and grow their businesses. Factor rate financing may be beneficial for your business if you:On the contrary, the interest rate can be a great option for small business owners who have a relatively better credit score or a little more time before they need working capital.Interest loan financing may be a great fit for your business if you: Bottom LineNo matter how you borrow money for your small business, it will always come with a cost. Loans with factor rates usually take shorter to get approved. The application process is typically more easy and fast and will require less documentation than financing like traditional bank loans.Before choosing a loan type, it’s a smart idea to work with a financing professional you trust to help you choose the best loan options as per your current financial needs and budget. Besides, you can apply through an online lending marketplace to find and compare a variety of loan offers from multiple lenders to see if you should go for interest rate or factor rate.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/finance/interest-rate-vs-factor-rate-the-difference.html"},

Khurana", "description": "gold loans refer to those loans which are availed by keeping gold jewellery and ornaments in banks as mortgage and the amount of money which is fixed as the gold loan percentage deposited is availed as loan. In this article, we will learn the process of availing of gold loans.", "word-count": 617, "body": "At times the banks also help people in times of financial distress when their income has significantly reduced or they are going through a phase of virtual unemployment, the banks help people by providing cash loans and tiding over the crisis in their lives. The most secure form of loan available in India is Gold Loans. The Indian Financial Infrastructure is highly dependent on the financial leverage provided by the nationalized government and private sector banks in the form of money loans provided to the public. The facility of availing these loans help people to gather venture and seed capital for their entrepreneurship purposes. Gold Loan is one of the most popular forms of loan available in the Indian Financial System. In Gold Loan, a person can avail a loan by pledging their gold jewellery and ornaments to the bank. The amount of loan received is a percentage of the market value of the loans that are kept as a pledge to the banks. Gold Loans are very secure thereby helping the consumer with an immediate cash need to either tide over a financial crisis they are undergoing or a huge amount of money they require for starting a new business venture. How to avail the gold loan?In the case of cash loans, some minimum eligibility criteria are required to be met for the person who is interested in availing of the facility. For example, the person who is looking to avail of the Gold Loan has to show his income statement and CIBIL scores to the bank. If the bank finds that his income statement shows a balancing figure that indicates that the person will not be able to repay the loan in time, it is the bank's discretion whether to provide a loan to the customer or not. On the other hand, if the bank finds that the customer has a discrepancy in the CIBIL score indicating that he is not particular with his or her habit of paying loans, the bank can withdraw the facility. However, with the Gold Loan, there are no such deliberations. Any businessman, servicemen, worker, housewive, or a consenting adult with the possession of gold can avail the facilities of a Gold Loan. The amount of interest to be paid is nominal, the customer can spare a bit of the money and use it to immunize money into the economy through the cycle of speculation and utilization. In this way, it keeps up the injectible level of capital investment in the economy achieving adjustment in the deflationary condition and enables the economy to recuperate from quite a recessionary stage. Interested clients who go to the banks to separate credits at nominal paces of revenue need to keep resources as records of individual security. This guarantees that the bank has made a protected exchange as the obligation of keeping the individual resources in the bank guarantees that the borrower would not submit any demonstration of phoney. Besides, it likewise guarantees that the purchaser or borrower is obligated for the cash that he has acquired from the banks.Eligibility of a gold loanIn the case of Gold Loan per gram, the tenure provided varies according to the policies mandated by the public sector and the private sector banks providing the loan. Generally, the loan tenure ranges from a period of 3-12 months. Thus the user should pay regular interests and be particular about the payment of the installment and the principal amount along with the interest at the time of repayment. ConclusionThe above discussion thus gives a vivid idea about Gold Loan and identifies the category of person who can avail it. Gold Loan is thus a very advantageous form of leverage regulation.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/finance/how-to-use-a-gold-loan.html"},

The increasing prices meant that people turned their attention towards other means of family and individual entertainment. The emergence of streaming devices and various streaming services diverted the public attention towards themselves.Nevertheless, when you cut the cable, you tend to subscribe to various other services, which leads to a spike in the internet bills. Therefore, instead of cutting the cord, contact your cable TV provider and add limited live TV options. Getting back cable TV does not mean that you keep paying a higher price than you should. Start with scanning your cable TV bill. Identify all the costs that count as premium services. Extra movie channels, unwanted premium programming, etc. Take a minute to think about their costs and evaluate if you can live without them.Many people think that cutting down on your services is a good idea. It may sound like a good idea but it isn’t. Talk to a service representative in detail before you decide to cut your home phone loose, thinking your mobile is enough.There is one service you cannot imagine living without: the internet! No one is suggesting that you get rid of it. Just assess the internet speed that you really need. More often than not, people get an internet connection just because faster sounds good. Chances are you have a faster connection than what you need and are paying much more than you should. Assess, think, and change, if necessary. Getting a slower internet connection that aptly fulfills your needs will significantly lower your bill.Checking your cable bill can reveal a lot of new information. While you’re at it look for the heading that says, Equipment Rentals. That’s one thing that you keep paying for but you shouldn’t. No matter what provider you subscribed to, all will use some equipment and most use a similar type. So, this is a place where you can bring down your bill.Most providers will charge something around $8 for an internet router. Now, this you can easily avoid. Get to the providers’ website and look for a compatible router and invest in it once and for all. You can easily get one in about $60. This way you save a little bit of money. Small components will form up a decent amount at the end of the year.We’ve briefly talked about this in the first suggestion. Almost every household uses cable TV, internet, and phone. Why not get all from a single provider. Bundling them together will give you a lot of ease and comfort. More importantly, it gets you to save a decent amount of money.Most providers offer amazing deals when you bundle their services. The most popular bundle is combining the internet with cable TV. Getting internet alone costs around $30 (depending upon the provider and your connection speed) getting cable TV from a separate provider will cost at least the same. That takes the cost up to $60. Get both from the same provider and you can easily get it for $39. That is a solid $21 saving every month. For instance,  costs starting at $44.99 per month and give you access to the internet with speeds of up to 940 Mbps, cable TV with a variety of more than 200 channels, and crystal-clear phone service with the facility to make unlimited nationwide as well as long-distance calls.Almost all providers offer special discounts. Chances are there is a special offer or deal available in your area. You need to make a call and specifically ask if there’s such an offer up for grabs. If there’s none, then ask for a discount. Make sure you’ve done your research and know what they offer. If everything fails, call your existing provider and ask for a discount, the last thing they want is their client walking away from them.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/finance/how-to-lower-your-cable-tv-and-internet-bill.html"},

Thus, understanding and incorporating economic indicators while making decisions is vital.", "word-count": 747, "body": "Top economic indicators, index and report which you can consider while trading forex There are technical tools and fundamental tools which help in analysing the trade in the forex trading. Most of the traders make use of them, but somewhere to harvest most, you require to learn other concepts which affect the price of the currency. Here we have compiled the list of top economic indicators which you can consider while making the trading decisions. 1) Economic indicators Economic indicators refer to the report or data issued by the private or the government organisation which reflect the economic performance of the country's currency. The economic information is the key instrument through which one can directly estimate the economic health of the county. But always remember that there are some other political factors which too affect the financial performance of the nation. 2) Gross domestic product or GDPGDP refers to the total value of products and services produced in a boundary of the country during a given financial year. It is also regarded as the primary tool to measure the economy of a country. The figures for GDP acts as a lagging indicator. Most traders pay attention to two reports issued in the months before the final gross domestic figure data releases. These are the preliminary report and the advance report. Notable revisions of these reports can lead to considerable volatility. 3) Retail Sales The retail sales data keeps the track and estimates the total financial receipts of all retail stores in a provided country. This report is prepared by collecting several samples from retail stores throughout the country. Traders can use this to anticipate the performance of most vital lagging signals and to assess the instant direction of the economy. Revision of this retail sales report helps in causing significant volatility. One can also compare the sales movements of a publicly-traded firm with retail sales reports. 4) Industrial production This report reflects a variation in the production of mines, utilities and factories within a country. It also brings out its utilisation capacity. It is the degree to which the capacity of the factory is used. It is suitable for a country if the production increases while being at its zenith or near-maximum capacity utilisation. 5) Consumer price index (CPI) The consumer price index estimates the variations in the cost of goods across 200 distinct categories. When we compare this report with the total national export, then we can see if the nation is losing or making capital on its goods and services. Stay vigilant and monitor the exports. It is because this is the famous focus with many investors as the cost of exports generally varies concerning currency's weakness or strength. How to start trading with a suitable broker?The process of opening an account with an authentic financial service provider is simple and instant.

However, at times, we lack the proper motivation, the right information, and the plan required to reach our financial goals. And hence we look for a personal financial advisor. There are some golden rules that will always be relevant to your wealth management irrespective of your financial goals.", "word-count": 787, "body": "1. Know your real worthThis is the first step to create a solid financial plan for yourself. When you know your net worth, you also know your assets and liabilities. It offers you a snapshot of your financial position at a given point in time. Knowing your net worth allows you to confront the realities of your current financial situation. A review of your net worth helps determine where exactly you stand. It shows you the path of where you want to go in terms of personal finance. It also gives you a wake-up call if you are not heading in the right direction. If you have trouble determining your net worth you can always consult a  online or offline depending on your convenience. 2. Spend less than your incomeIt sounds like very old advice, but as they say, old is gold. To create wealth, you must have surplus funds to invest in the market. You should not simply exhaust all of your monthly income on pleasure instruments. We are not suggesting you be overly frugal, but have a cautious approach while spending your hard-earned money. Keeping track of your monthly budget is an excellent way to start. 3. Invest wisely with proper knowledge about the productYou need to have leftover funds to invest in. However, there are so many schemes and products on the market to invest in. Do not gamble your hard-earned money on products that are difficult to understand. Decent quality of assets can offer you capital growth as well as income. You need to consider your risk limits before investing in any financial instrument. It is recommended that you should speak to a  for an organized wealth management plan.4. Don't put all your eggs in one basketThis is an old saying, yet it is very appropriate while investing. You need to keep a standard variation in your asset allocation. Diversification of your investments has three key advantages:  5. Be patientInvestments are always subject to market risks. It is important to not panic with the slightest fluctuations in the market. You need to trust your investments, have patience, and give them time so that it can settle and mature. Patience will ensure that you get the best returns for your investments. In case of market fluctuations or when you are worried about returns on investments, it is advisable to speak with your financial advisor before arriving at any hasty decisions. Always remember, volatility is an integral part of any investment and can be tackled with patience. 6. Monitor your investments periodicallyPatience is good for any investment. However, only patience will not help you generate great returns. You need to keep a regular tab on all your investments. It will allow you to find out which investments are performing and those which are not. It will help reshuffle your asset allocation, to get the best returns over a period of time. 7. Be safe, be insuredYou can never be sure of what life has planned for you. It is imperative to have proper insurance cover while creating wealth. People purchase insurance to save taxes or as an investment or both. However, you mustn't mix your investments and insurance. First, you need to have the proper coverage that will take care of your family and you in case of any emergency. Next, choose those insurance policies such as endowment or child plans that will help you reach your financial goals. In the end, buy plans such as unit-linked insurance policies (ULIPs) that will help you create wealth. 8. Plan your taxesOne thing is certain in finance: taxes will never go away. The rules, regulations, and tax brackets will change according to time, however, taxation itself will remain. It keeps affecting your finances in every aspect. You need to have a strong approach in terms of dealing with taxes. Don't wake up when it is the final week of filing your returns. Plan your taxes well ahead. Consult with a financial planning advisor who will guide you to make the necessary investments that will provide you a tax benefit. Planning your taxes will not only save you from the chaos and hasty investment decisions, but it will also help you save money. 9. Plan for retirementRetirement planning is an important part of your wealth management plan. You have to make sure that all the wealth creation ideas must be in line with your retirement too. You need to invest in such a way that even after your successful professional life, you can have a steady source of income and continue building up wealth. You can also avail of certain tax benefits. More importantly, you will have that peace of mind that you were always looking for! Source:", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/finance/little-known-ways-for-wealth-management.html"},

At the same time, environmental pollution makes our food more or less contaminated. Hypertension, coronary heart disease, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, obesity and other cardiovascular diseases based on the typical symptoms of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia have become the number one killer of modern human society. Cholesterol is a lipid. A proper amount of cholesterol plays an important role in maintaining the composition and function of cell membranes, the formation of steroid hormones, bile acids, and the synthesis of vitamin D3. However, excessive cholesterol may induce chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease, hypertension, and myocardial infarction. Every year, more than 500,000 Americans die from sudden heart attacks caused by coronary heart disease. When there is too much cholesterol in the blood, they will continue to be deposited on the blood vessel wall as the blood circulates. Under the action of serum fibrin, the blood vessels are narrowed, slowing down the blood flow, and may even block the blood vessels. As we grow older, this blockage will gradually make arteries lose their elasticity and become hard, and blood pressure will increase. Various nutrients and oxygen in the blood cannot reach the required parts well. Eventually cause coronary heart disease (hardening of the coronary arteries). In recent years, people's main method of lowering cholesterol is based on the transport mechanism of cholesterol, that is, lowering LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol) and increasing HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol) content. LDL-C is a lipoprotein that transports cholesterol from the whole body to the blood, and HDL-C is a lipoprotein that transports cholesterol from the blood to the whole body. Lower LDL-C, that is, reduce the cholesterol transported by the whole body to the blood, and the blood cholesterol will be reduced. In the same way, increasing HDL-C will reduce blood cholesterol. There is also a contradiction in medication. There are many drugs on the market that can lower cholesterol, but they can cause serious side effects. The PDR warns pregnant women and people with liver and kidney disease to avoid cholesterol-lowering drugs. Even in healthy people, these drugs often cause abdominal pain, allergic reactions, emotional imbalance, hair loss, vision changes, headaches, sore throats, and muscle degeneration. Some patients experience impotence and decreased libido after taking these drugs. At this time probiotic therapy highlights its advantages. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments have proved that  can reduce serum cholesterol levels. Investigations in some tribes in Africa have found that people who take a lot of lactic acid bacteria fermented milk for a long time have significantly lower serum cholesterol levels than the general population. It is generally believed that probiotics use three different methods to lower cholesterol. First, probiotics interfere with the absorption of cholesterol in the intestines. This effect is obvious when a large number of probiotics exist. Secondly, probiotics can directly assimilate cholesterol. When probiotics are grown in a high-cholesterol medium, the cholesterol content is reduced. This mechanism was confirmed in this experiment. Third, probiotics produce metabolites that can affect the system's blood lipid levels. The bile hydrolase produced by probiotics promotes the precipitation of cholesterol and bile acid, thereby reducing the chance of cholesterol entering the blood. In a Swedish study, 30 subjects were divided into two groups. One group drank 200 ml of juice containing 50 million active lactobacilli per ml per day, and the other group drank juice without probiotics. After six weeks, the serum cholesterol and fibrin levels of the first group were significantly reduced. There was no significant change in the other group as a control.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/health/probiotic-therapy-to-lower-cholesterol.html"},

It will, however, feel and be the new abnormal for a long time. For me personally, the 7 plus weeks of being under stay-at-home orders brought me back to the 9 ½ years I cared for my mother in virtual isolation as written in my book One Caregiver’s Journey. I am a veteran at living alone. I have not become depressed, bored or anxious because it is a life I once lived and have had little trouble readjusting to my former self. I have observed as my neighbors complain loudly and struggle when the cleaning ladies cannot come, department stores are closed, or their weekly social activities such as knitting and reading clubs or bridge parties are cancelled. I try to patiently listen to all the complaints and watch as people grow restless, depressed or stressed. It is hard to be empathetic or compassionate. I am happy to navigate to my kitchen, to prepare a meal quietly and am content to watch television, read or get in a walk. I have continued to workout up to an hour daily with online videos offered by my health club. Frankly, I might not return to my health club for the convenience and satisfaction I have found exercising alone at home. During my walks I have seen families pushing strollers, people in masks talking and laughing across driveways, kids on skateboards, dogs wagging, elderly people pushing walkers with a smile and then I realize that not everyone is struggling. These people are finding balance in an otherwise uneventful day during a national health crisis.

Until now, many people still believe in this. However, even the most perfect food in nature can be contaminated by the earth's ecology destroyed by humans. The pollution and destruction of the ecological environment and the lifestyles of modern society have caused many women to reduce their milk production, while the quality of milk is also declining. This situation is particularly evident in large cities and heavily polluted areas. There is evidence that the quality of breast milk has declined worldwide. Obviously, it is mainly due to the presence of human pollutants in the air, water and food chain. The quality of breast milk directly affects the composition of the baby's intestinal flora. The intestinal flora of babies today is very different from those of babies half a century ago. Although Bifidobacterium infantis is the preferred colonizing bacteria, more recent studies have shown that other species of bifidobacteria, such as Bifidobacterium bifidum and Bifidobacterium longum, are now the dominant bacteria in the intestines of breastfed babies. Dr. Rasic pointed out that  is not as 'strong' as other Bifidobacteria, which means that it is rarely found in the food chain, air and water. Even so, Bifidobacterium infantis can resist invading harmful microorganisms in the intestine, including E. coli, Klebsiella and even Salmonella. In a 1988 research paper 'The presence of Bifidobacterium infantis and Bifidobacterium bifidum in the intestines of infants and adults', Dr. J.L. Rasic reported the changes in the composition of the intestinal flora of German infants in the past 30 years. This study showed a decrease in the number of bifidobacteria and a decline in strains in breastfed babies. The decline in beneficial bacteria is accompanied by an increase in the number of unwanted pathogenic microorganisms. From 1974 to 1977, the last few years of the study, it was found that more than 10% of babies had no Bifidobacterium detected in their feces. The same trend was also found in premature babies. Although the number of bifidobacteria in premature babies is less than that of full-pregnant babies, there are also a small amount of bifidobacteria in these fragile new lives. Dr. Rasic discovered that two types of dangerous bacteria-Klebsiella and coliform bacteria can grow steadily in some babies of the same age. These kinds of pathogenic bacteria are now generally found to be resistant to antibiotics. Dr. Rasic also noticed that the average pH of the baby's gastrointestinal tract gradually increased, indicating a decrease in acidity in the large intestine. Obviously this will promote the overgrowth of bad bacteria and fungi. Researchers in the UK, Germany and France have confirmed Dr. Rasic's findings. Using computer models, a group of scientists predicted that babies’ intestinal tracts are inevitably facing the constant loss of beneficial bacteria along with an increase in dangerous pathogenic bacteria. This replacement of the flora will have serious consequences. Dr. A. Schecter and T. Gasiewicz outlined this problem in their 1987 book (Solving the Problem of Hazardous Waste). They proved that toxic chemicals such as polychlorinated diphenylfurans have increased in human milk in different regions (the United States, Canada and Vietnam). Breastfeeding infants are the front line of receiving these toxic substances. It is understandable that the content of toxic substances in human milk in Vietnam is much higher than that in the United States and Canada. This is due to the extensive use of herbicides during the Vietnam War. However, potentially carcinogenic chemicals have also been found in the breast milk of North American women. In 1980, the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition published a paper 'The Effect of Breastfeeding on Intestinal Bifidobacterium in Newborns' by three doctors H. Beerens, C. Romond, and C. Neut. Three pointed out that feeding babies with different combinations of bifidobacteria, the number of bifidobacteria may be similar, but the types are different. These differences can have a great impact on health. The study also showed that the main difference between cow's milk and breast-fed babies is that cow-fed babies have high levels of dangerous bacteria of the Bacteroides, Clostridium and E. coli. Such a high content will not decrease as the child grows up. After examining various food sources that can enhance the colonization of beneficial bacteria in the baby’s gastrointestinal tract, the doctor concluded that human milk is still the best. They wrote: No other mammal's milk can promote the growth of bifidobacteria.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/health/probiotics-and-breastfeeding.html"},

However, not all bacteria are harmful. There are many microorganisms such as bacteria that are beneficial to human health. They are generally divided into two categories:   The probiotics mainly refer to the screening of some functional lactic acid bacteria and yeasts. Antibiotics are drugs that inhibit and kill all living substances at very low concentrations. For example, the various drugs we use to resist bacteria, viruses, and parasites, as well as anti-tumor drugs, all belong to the category of antibiotics. So antibiotics can kill .Antibiotics are also medicines. After they enter the human body, they exert their therapeutic effects and also cause many adverse reactions. The most obvious is the increase in bacterial resistance. The intake of probiotics does not need to consider the issue of drug resistance, and there will be basically no side effects. It's not. Bifidus factors or probiotic factors are substances that promote the proliferation of bifidobacteria or probiotics in the intestinal tract and belong to the category of prebiotics. It can withstand the corrosion of gastric juice and bile, and reach the intestines in a living state. It can multiply in the intestine, and it has been proven by scientific experiments to improve the intestinal flora. It can also ensure safety, which is originally a kind of intestinal flora. Survive in food and can maintain effective bacterial count; inexpensive and easy to handle. Only when the above conditions are met can it be called a probiotic. We live in an era of fierce competition, with heavy pressure, worsening environment, serious pollution, unreasonable diet structure, excessive consumption of meat and fats, and insufficient intake of cereals, over-exquisite food processing, etc. These changes in diet and environment have caused great changes in the flora in our body, including their composition, quantity and balance. Put us in a sub-healthy state. The imbalance of the intestinal flora in the body will cause a series of potential diseases. Therefore, it is very necessary for us to supplement beneficial bacteria.  Vulnerable groups: middle-aged and elderly people, babies, children and womenPeople in urgent need of supplementation: 1.

It is better to use an online eligibility cacluator and learn how much you can afford as a loan amount. Experts don't recomend to buy your home entirely with your savings.", "word-count": 580, "body": "Before you buy a house, you have to analyse your financial capability. Financing the purchase of your house by using only your savings can be difficult. Hence, many people take loans to buy their dream house. The process of getting a loan is pretty lengthy and a lot of factors come into play before your application for a home loan is accepted. Your eligibility for a home loan depends on your income, age, loan repayment history and job stability. It is recomended to use a loan affordability calculator or sites like BankBazaar  to learn maximum loan amount you can afford with your current earning. Bankbazaar eligibility calculator provides best loan amount quotes by comparing with all major banks and financial institutions in India providing home loan. If you are looking to take a home loan, then these tips could help in making the process easier for you: 1. Make Enquiries About Your Credit Score Credit score is a numeric expression assigned by the credit bureaus to you. This figure is determined based on your credit history and ranges from 300 to 900. If you have a credit score over 700, there is a higher chance that a lender will accept your home loan application. This is why it is crucial that you check your credit score before you apply for a home loan. If you notice that your credit score is low, you should take necessary steps to improve your credit score.  2. You Should Make a Budget for Your Homeownership Cost The value of the house is not the only cost that you need to bear. There are a lot of other expenses that you have to pay-stamp duty charges, registration fee, GST and, paying charges to the municipality. So, keep in mind these expenses and try to reach an approximate figure of these charges so that you can have an estimate of your total loan cost.  3. Get a Pre-Approval for the Loan If you want an assurance that you will get a home loan, make sure to get pre-approved for the same. Getting pre-approved for a home loan will depend on your repayment history and capacity.  4. Fix Your FOIR FOIR is Fixed-Obligation-to-Income. This is the ratio of your net monthly income to your total payment of all loans. If this ratio is 50 and more, your loan application might get rejected. It is always better to close your loan and pay all credit card dues for decreasing the ratio.  5. Your CIBIL Report Should Be Error-Free The credit bureaus will frequently update your credit report. Any missing update or an error on your report can negatively affect your CIBIL score. If you do find any error in the report, immediately report this to the concerned credit bureau and ask them to update the same. This will ensure an error-free credit report and a better credit score for you.  6. You Need Money for down Payment A home loan does not cover the entire cost of your house. You will have to pay the down payment amount from your pocket. The maximum amount that you can get as a home loan is 80%-85% of your property price. The remaining amount is covered under down payment.  Buying a house not only reflects your financial stability, but also gives you a feeling of pride, and a sense of security. Keep these points in mind before you apply for a home loan so you can be well-prepared for the process.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/finance/tips-on-home-loan-approval-for-first-time-home-buyers.html"},
{"heading": "Several Factors Affecting the Effect of Enzyme Preparation", "author": "Fiona Bingly", "description": "Enzyme preparations have penetrated into all aspects of our lives due to their high efficiency, safety, non-toxic side effects and low environmental impact. For example, the bread to eat, the juice and beverage we drink, the seasoning for cooking, and the paper documents we use can all use enzyme preparations.", "word-count": 810, "body": "Enzyme preparations have penetrated into all aspects of our lives due to their high efficiency, safety, non-toxic side effects and low environmental impact. For example, the bread we eat, the juice and beverage we drink, the seasoning for cooking, and the paper documents we use can all use enzyme preparations. Therefore, understanding the chemical nature of enzyme preparations is of great significance for the rational and correct use of enzyme preparations. We need to understand several factors that affect the catalytic action of enzyme preparations. Each enzyme exhibits high activity only in a specific pH range, which is the optimal pH value for enzyme action. Generally speaking, enzymes are most stable at the optimum pH value, so the pH value at which the enzyme acts is also its stable pH value. If the pH value of the enzyme reaction is too high or too low, the enzyme will be irreversibly damaged, and the stability and activity will decrease, or even inactivation. Different enzymes have different optimum pH ranges, including acidic, neutral, and alkaline. For example, according to the optimal pH value of protease action, it is often divided into acid protease, neutral  and alkaline protease. The pH value of enzyme action is also a parameter measured under certain conditions. The temperature or substrate is different, the optimal pH of enzyme action is different, the higher the temperature, the narrower the stable pH range of enzyme action. Therefore, in the process of enzyme-catalyzed reaction, the pH value of the reaction must be strictly controlled. Under certain conditions, each enzyme has an optimal temperature at which the enzyme activity is the highest and the effect is the best. The increase in the speed of the enzyme catalytic reaction and the thermal denaturation loss of the enzyme activity reach a balance. This temperature is the optimum temperature for enzyme action. Each enzyme has a stable activity temperature. At this temperature, under a certain time, pH and enzyme concentration, the enzyme is relatively stable, and there is no or very little activity decline. This temperature is the stable temperature of the enzyme. Acting beyond the stable temperature, the enzyme will be inactivated rapidly. Under certain conditions of temperature, pH and enzyme concentration, the substrate concentration is the main factor that determines the speed of the enzyme catalytic reaction. When the substrate concentration is very low, the catalytic reaction speed of the enzyme increases rapidly with the increase of the substrate concentration. As the substrate concentration increases, the reaction speed slows down and no longer increases in direct proportion. The relationship between the substrate concentration and the rate of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction can generally be expressed by the Michaelis equation. Sometimes the substrate concentration is very high, and the enzyme reaction speed will decrease due to substrate inhibition. When the substrate concentration greatly exceeds the enzyme concentration, the enzyme-catalyzed reaction speed is generally proportional to the enzyme concentration. In addition, if the enzyme concentration is too low, the enzyme sometimes becomes ineffective, making the reaction impossible. In the enzyme-catalyzed reaction in food processing, the amount of enzyme is generally much less than the amount of substrate, and the cost factor of enzyme should also be considered. Many substances can weaken, inhibit, or even destroy the action of enzymes. These substances are called . Such as heavy metal ions (Fe3+, Cu2+, Hg+, Pb+, etc.), carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, organic cations, ethylenediamine and tetraacetic acid. Many substances have the effect of protecting and increasing enzyme activity, or promoting the conversion of inactive enzyme proteins into active enzymes. These substances are collectively called enzyme activators. Activators can be divided into three categories: The first category is inorganic ions, such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cu2+, Co2+, Zn2+ and other cations, and Cl-, NO3-, PO43-, SO42- and other anions. The second category is organic matter with smaller molecules, mainly vitamin B family and its derivatives. The third category is high molecular substances with protein properties. The activator has a similar effect on the enzyme-catalyzed reaction rate and the concentration of the substrate, but it is rarely used in actual production. Enzyme preparations are in a dormant state in a low temperature environment. To keep the enzymes long-term storage without losing activity, the enzyme activity will be lost 5-10%/6 months when stored at 10°C, and 10-15%/6 months will be lost when stored at room temperature. So the key lies in the dry environment and low temperature. Both heat and light can easily inactivate enzymes. Therefore, enzyme preparations should be stored airtightly at low temperatures and protected from light. In addition, the higher the moisture content of the enzyme preparation, the easier it is to inactivate, so the general powdered enzyme preparation is easy to store and transport. In addition, some metal ions can also cause enzyme inactivation or inhibit enzyme activity. Avoid choosing metal ion containers to store enzyme preparations.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/health/several-factors-affecting-the-effect-of-enzyme-preparation.html"},

As early as in ancient times, humans’ ordinary diets are already rich in lactic acid fermentation foods. Probiotic products refer to live bacteria preparations and their metabolic products that promote the host's microecological balance and exert beneficial effects to improve the health of the host. The researchers pointed out that there is a huge but constantly changing group of microbes in the human body. Most of them live in the intestines, and most of the others live in the mouth, esophagus, stomach and upper respiratory tract. Researchers from the University of Washington and Stanford University have found at least 395 kinds of microorganisms in the intestines of three healthy people. These microorganisms also participate in digestion and produce energy. 'Some people's intestinal microbes provide energy more efficiently than others, and they are more likely to gain weight.' Gordon, the person in charge of this study, believes that the energy content of food is not a fixed value. A cup of 110-kcal beverage, its energy may be affected by the microbes in the intestines, some people will absorb all of it, others may absorb less. If there is a difference of 25 kilocalories between people's daily energy intake and energy consumption, that year may increase or decrease by more than 2 pounds. This work shows that trying to change the composition of the intestinal microorganisms may be a way to change body weight. One day, people can use  or other microbial control strategies to reduce the efficiency of energy provided by intestinal microbes and help people regulate obesity. Similar research can also help millions of people around the world who do not eat enough or lose weight due to cancer or heart disease. The formation of human fat is mainly formed by the decomposition of sugars and cholesterol. The human body colonizes the intestinal tract after ingesting Lactobacillus johnsonii, participates in digestion, absorption, and metabolism, and fully exerts the effect of reducing body fat and cholesterol.   Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation, which may damage health. The most common cause of the development of obesity is the imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. In this complex process, genetic susceptibility, environment and lifestyle are involved. Recent studies have identified the intestinal flora as an environmental factor affecting systemic metabolism. They affect energy balance, inflammation and intestinal barrier function. Moreover, the gut microbiota can increase weight by integrating peripheral and central regulatory signals of food intake. The human intestinal flora represents a complex ecosystem, composed of trillions of microorganisms and thousands of bacterial species, which are deeply involved in different functions of host metabolism. The intestinal microflora is closely related to obesity and metabolic disorders. They can regulate energy-extracting efficiency and increase energy storage and adiposity. They can also produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) from indigestible polysaccharides to modulate energy intake and metabolism. Preclinical evidence indicates that the benefits on body weight translate into favorable metabolic effects. The probiotic bacterial strains, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains, have been consistently shown to affect glucose homeostasis. Several probiotic strains have been tested as agents with potential antidiabetic effects. Administration of Lactobacillus curvatus and Lactobacillus plantarum prevented the development of the high-fructose diet-induced metabolic syndrome.

Green, safe and efficient enzyme preparations are good substitutes for chemical agents in traditional food processing. The most widely used in modern industry is protease, which is a type of enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of proteins, and is the earliest and most in-depth enzyme in enzymatic research. It is closely related to human beings and involves all aspects of life. It is widely used in meat tenderization, polypeptide processing, beer clarification and bread quality improvement industries in the food industry. What role does protease play in food? The sensory quality of food is mainly determined by the functional properties of food protein, and these unique functions are closely related to the size, shape and surface chemical properties of protein molecules. It is further related to the combination of protein molecules and flavor substances, which affects the taste of food. The proteases used in food processing mainly include , trypsin,  and microbial protease. Food protein is changed by protease enzymatic hydrolysis to change the structure of protein at all levels, so that the chemical properties of protein change. Thereby affecting its solubility, hydration, emulsification and other functional properties, which is conducive to the production of higher standards of various foods. Protein is an essential nutrient required by the human body and constitutes the main component of various tissues of the human body. Insufficient protein intake can cause various diseases such as anemia, aging, tissue and organ damage, and seriously threaten human health. Therefore, it is particularly important to improve the digestion and utilization of protein. Adding  to food is one of the main ways to improve protein utilization. From the initial stage of food processing to the process of food storage and transportation, protease can not only promote the decomposition of protein into small molecule peptides and amino acids, and improve the digestion and absorption of protein by the human body, but also can be used to produce new high-protein foods to solve children and elderly people. As well as the problem of protein requirements for special populations, it is helpful to improve the digestibility and utilization of protein in food. 3 Remove sediments and extend shelf life Many foods need to be stored at a lower temperature to achieve the purpose of inhibiting enzyme activity and extending the shelf life. However, most liquid beverages are prone to a large amount of precipitation during storage. The main component of the precipitation is protein, and some also include polyphenol compounds or macromolecular sugars. In the production, storage and transportation of colloidal liquid beverages, a large number of macromolecules are prone to precipitate, which affects the quality and flavor of food and subsequent sales. Protease can effectively decompose protein and improve the precipitation caused by protein in beverages.

For example, businesses that store large quantities of fuel, or food production facilities that may store large quantities of cooking oils.", "word-count": 751, "body": "Many businesses and commercial enterprises use and store oils as part of their everyday operations. For example, businesses that store large quantities of fuel, or food production facilities that may store large quantities of cooking oils.  The Oil Storage Regulations govern the storage of these oils to stop sub-standard oil storage practices that could result in pollution. Oil is one of the most prolific pollutants in the UK, causing between 15% and 25% of all polluting incidents. Just a small amount of oil could seriously pollute a water source, making it poisonous to wildlife and unsuitable for human consumption. Whilst the vast majority of these incidents are accidental, caused by poor storage, some are intentional, such as pouring waste oils into drains or dumping it. If you own any business in England that produces or uses oils, of any kind, then you must familiarise yourself with the regulations that apply to oil storage and your responsibilities, to ensure you are operating with the law. The Oil Storage Regulations that apply to most locations within the UK are: Do the Regulations Apply to my Business? If you store oil in a container that can hold 200 litres, or more, then the regulations apply to you and your business.  What types of oil do the regulations apply to? A huge range of oils are covered by the legislation, including: When do the Oil Storage Regulations NOT apply? Some oil-based products are not covered by the regulations, such as liquid petroleum gas (LPG), bitumen and waste mineral oils from vehicles. You will also be exempt from following the oil storage regulations if your oil is being used on a farm and used to heat or provide power; if it is contained with a hydraulic system for use as a lubricant, or if you are storing oil at an oil refinery or ready for distribution. If you are exempt, you may still need to obtain a permit to, so be sure to check the requirements with the Environment Agency. Oil storage tanks If you need to install an oil tank, to store the oil that you use or produce as part of your business operations, whether it’s waste oil or oil to be used, you need to ensure it is installed professionally to meet safety, environmental and legal requirements. If your tank is installed incorrectly, and it causes any leaks or pollutes the surrounding land or water systems, you will be held liable. If the leaks or pollution are found to be a result of a poorly managed or installed oil storage tank, you could face large, uncapped fines. You may also have to pay clean-up costs, and be served with an anti-pollution notice from the Environment Agency that will force you take the necessary steps to rectify the issues.  Choosing a company that is registered as part of the government’s ‘Competent Person’ scheme will ensure you are dealing with a reputable and professionally approved company. If you chose a company to install your tank, and they are not properly qualified, you will be solely  responsible for any spills, leaks or pollution that results from an inadequate tank. Bunded Oil Storage TanksThe oil storage regulations refer to secondary containment systems, more commonly known as bunded tanks. If you operate a commercial or industrial site, such a food processing facility that stores large quantities of cooking oil, and your tank has a capacity of 200 litres or more, it should be bunded. A bund is an additional layer around the tank, often made from concrete or constructed in brick. The bunding must be constructed in line with ISO 9000 and be able to contain 110% of the tank’s full capacity. Other requirements include: If you’re unsure about what regulations apply to you, and what you need to do to comply, the best action to take is contacting the Environment Agency for advice. They will be able to answer you questions about all oil storage regulations in England. This is particularly important if your tank is within 10 metres of inland coastal waters, or 50 meters of a well or borehole.Storing Smaller Quantities of Oil As a small business, who stores less than 200 litres of fresh or used cooking oils, the above oil storage regulations will not apply to you. However, you must still ensure that any cooking oil stored on your premises is kept responsibly and safely. You will be subject to local authority rules, so contact them for advice. Responsible cooking oil storage means:", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/food/storing-oil-at-your-home-or-business-premises.html"},

The son of one of the founders, Pontus Lindwall, founded NetEnt in 1996. Alongside Microgaming, NetEnt is considered the pioneer of the iGaming industry. Since 2011, NetEnt has entered the mobile games segment of the market. Most of NetEnt’s top titles are available in both a desktop and mobile format.What’s So Special about NetEnt?The best way to critique an iGaming company (or any other business) is by referring to the so-called ‘Unique Selling Points,’ this company’s characteristics that make it stand out against the rest. NetEnt has at least three: the selection of games, quality, and innovation. , including video poker, scratch cards, live and mobile casino games, and, most importantly, slots. In each of these categories, the developer delivers content of the highest quality, which explains the popularity of NetEnts’ products in the iGaming market. Also, while many online casino software developers stick to desktop versions of the software, NetEnt’s experience with mobile games is over ten years long. Given the convenience of gambling on the phone and the popularity of mobile games among gamblers, it’s one of NetEnt’s top achievements.NetEnt’s Best ProductsStarburstAlthough Starburst is almost 10 years old, it’s the company’s most popular game. Starburst is a simple slot with a nice-to-look-at interface, generous bonuses, and uncomplicated rules. It may not be as impressive as a newer graphic masterpiece, Asgardian Stones, but it never fails to attract gamblers who appreciate tasteful simplicity.Divine FortuneDivine Fortune is another slot in NetEnt’s top five list. It’s more graphically advanced and, unlike Starburst, has a plot. Divine Fortune is based on well-familiar stories from Ancient Greek mythology, which is perhaps why so many players are drawn to it.Blood SuckersBlood Suckers is a slot unlike any others. First created several years ago, when the entire world was obsessed with vampire stories, Blood Suckers has been re-released and managed to retain its popularity. One of the game’s main advantages is an eerie instrumental soundtrack that turns playing Blood Suckers into an almost immersive experience.NarcosNarcos is a slot created on the wave of the television show’s popularity. No one’s watching Netflix’s Narcos anymore, but NetEnt’s slot remains as popular as ever. Narcos are perfect for anyone who likes the atmosphere of the GTA but prefers slots. What’s more, the graphics in this one is amazing.There’s no better way to introduce NetEnt than to recommend a couple of the company’s games and let you be the judge. Luckily, NetEnt’s product line is so vast that anyone will find something addictive. If you’re bad at making decisions, simply flip a coin to choose one from the four titles above.

Even though your pet loves you, they can’t help their animalistic, survival instinct: fight or flight. Negative reactions to different social situations need to be viewed with a certain amount of grace. You can’t protect your pet from everything, but you can certainly create as calm and secure an environment as possible. To do this, remove as many stressors as you can. This might mean you don’t get to bring large groups of people over or play loud music. Although that might be disappointing for you, your pet will certainly be grateful.You can’t completely anxiety proof where you live.

{"heading": "FFXIV Crafting Leveling Guide – Levels 1-80", "author": "Snow Smith", "description": "Welcome to", "word-count": 760, "body": "Levels 1-20 First, you are going to pick a Crafter. In this guide, I am choosing the Goldsmith and travel to the Goldsmiths’ Guild in Ul’dah. Upon arrival at the Goldsmiths’ guild, you will see a guild supplier. You’ll want to buy materials from the guild supplier and make some of the low-level recipes. This is not only the most efficient way because it avoids you having to go out into the world and craft or gather, but it's also going to be more inexpensive than purchasing items from the Market board. I would recommend buying some of these mats from your guild supplier and leveling up from 1 to 20 with the mats. The first time you craft an item, you’ll have to do Synthesis, which requires you to input some rotations. For these low-level ones, you can just use your basic touch or basic Synthesis. Once you've made one successfully, you can do Quick Synthesis, and that allows you to make in bulk, which you’ll want to do it as much as you can because once you get into the Firmament at level 20, that's going to go away, and you’ll have to enter a rotation manually every time or use a macro.  Gearing As for the gear, it’s on a job-to-job basis and at your discretion when you want to upgrade your gear throughout this process. I prefer using the crappiest tools until I have to get better tools to make new items for leveling up. Muto in Kugane sells crafting and gathering gear and tools from level 60 to level 70, and these low-level gear should get you all the way through the leveling process.  Firmament Once you arrive in Firmament, turn right and talk to Potkin – the Collectable Appraiser. You can see a list of items he will take in exchange for Skybuilders' scrips and experience points. Under the “Collectability”, it shows what level of quality they have to be. At the bottom, you will see he has Kupo Stamps and rewards. Also, you can get some cool items and the Coffer o' Kupos. So, make sure that you're redeeming those coupons as you're going through this leveling process because you're going to get some free items and use the vouchers.  Levels 20-80 Skybuilders’ supplies on the Market Board are usually pretty cheap, so you can go there and search for some Skybuilders’ materials. But don't forget that you can always gather these materials yourself, and it’s also good if you need to level your Gatherers. Now, you are going to start making some collectibles. There are thresholds for Durability, Progress, and Quality. Some macros allow you to make items with the push of a button based on a rotation. You can get a lot of these macros from the , and you can modify them based on the job you’re leveling or the gear you’re using. These macros are not set in stone, so you may tinker with them a little bit. You can always choose Trial Synthesis to the left of Quick Synthesis before you go in and try to produce an item. That way, you can make sure you’ll be able to make it with all the right quality thresholds without wasting any of your materials. You’ll want to make this as economical and efficient as possible so that you don’t waste any of your hard-earned . You are going to continue repeating this process. Fill your entire inventory up, take the items to Potkin and trade them in, use your Coffer o' Kupos vouchers to get all those items, and go back to it. Don't forget that producing these items and delivering them to Potkin will generate you Skybuilders’ scripts. What I recommend you to do with those is save them up until you are almost capped, then buy yourself an Albino Karakul Horn or an Ufiti Horn from one of the merchants in Firmament because they are worth a very nice little chunk of change. I was making more money than I was spending on materials to level my Crafters. So, there is a little light at the end of the tunnel if you're looking at the cost of gil versus the time it’ll take for farming materials. That is how I leveled all of my  in 5 days, and you can do it too.

Poster beds are a classic style and have maintained their popularity over the years.", "word-count": 657, "body": "Today, the designs for 4 poster wooden beds have evolved in terms of the poster heights as well as the treatment given to them. If you’ve always wanted a poster bed in your bedroom, here are some of the styles you can choose between.This is probably the most classic design. In this case, posters stand at all the four corners of the bed. Depending on the style of the headboard, the posters near the head may be taller or shorter than the posters at the foot of the bed. However, they will all reach the same height from the floor. Full poster beds can have a classic or contemporary appeal. If you like a classic style, you can look at  with carved posters. A twirl or lathe work is the most popular. In the case of modernistic poster beds, you will find posters designed as straight columns or posters with a tapered top. The tapered style is also known as a pencil poster bed.One of the disadvantages of a poster bed is that it takes up considerable visual space in a room. Thus, though the floor space taken up by a poster bed and a platform bed may be the same, the former can make a room feel cramped. This is where half poster beds come in. These beds are designed with tall posters near the headboard and shorter posters at the foot board. As a result, the bed looks lighter without compromising on its aesthetics. However, you should note that half poster beds cannot be converted into canopy beds.While the maintain the grandeur of 4 poster beds, 2 poster beds are much more space friendly. These beds have only two elongated posts beside the headboard. The footboard does not have any posts. The headboard for 2 poster beds is usually ornate and carved. It may also be upholstered for added comfort. 2 poster beds are perfect for urban apartments. They also work well for a young girl’s room. As the name suggests, canopy beds refer to beds with a canopy above them. Many full four poster beds can be converted into canopy beds by connecting the tops of the 4 poster columns. Canopy beds are ideal for large rooms with high ceilings. These types of beds not only make a room look grand, they also give your bed additional privacy. The canopy for the bed may be made from many different materials ranging from sheer lace to thicker cottons. Specialty canopy beds may be designed such that their canopy looks like a crown or carriage.Though they are extremely beautiful to look at, you should note that these beds are harder to maintain as dust may accumulate on the canopy. In the summer months, this style of bed may also make your bed feel warmer as airflow around the bed is limited.Beds with a canopy that does not cover their entire length may be called half canopy beds. In these cases, the foot posts are merely ornamental. This style of bed is great if you want the canopy bed look but have a small bedroom. Half canopy single beds may also work well as daybeds in an informal lounge area.There’s nothing like a wooden bed with elegant posters or a canopy above it to make you feel like royalty. If you have the space, this is the ideal bed style for you. But, if you have a small bedroom, it may be better to choose a lighter bed. Another point to consider when buying poster beds is whether you shift homes often or will be living in the same house for a long time to come. Poster beds can be difficult to pack and put together so choose this style only if you are sure that you will not be moving soon. As with all types of furniture, when you choose your bed, along with the design, pay attention to the type and quality of wood used.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/home-repair/types-of-4-poster-wooden-beds.html"},

Let us look at some of the telltale signs that indicate problems with your air conditioning unit.", "word-count": 467, "body": "The air conditioner system, which keeps your home cool and comfortable, needs to be maintained frequently so that it does not break down during peak summers. Most homeowners ignore or are unaware of the warning signs that indicate AC troubles for too long until the system breaks down completely. It is always wise to call in the professionals for air conditioner repairs in Jacksonville, FL if you happen to notice any of these telltale signs in your home. Little or no air from the vents One of the most obvious signs that indicate trouble brewing with your AC unit is when it gives little or no air from the vents. The problem might be with the ducts or the compressor if it blows a bit of cold air but not enough to keep the entire room cool and comfortable. However, only a professional AC repair technician can identify the actual cause of the problem, which amplifies the need to hire their services before the system shuts down completely. The earlier the problem is identified and addressed, the lesser the chances of complete replacement. Warm air and loud noisesAnother common issue that most homeowners face with their AC units is that it blows hot or warm instead of cold air. This is perhaps the last thing on earth that you want, particularly at the height of summer days. While some of the reasons for it might be due to a broken compressor or a leak in the refrigerant, it is better to call professionals to check and address the issue as quickly as possible. Most of the air conditioner units function quietly and any unusual sounds such as grating, grinding, squealing noises might indicate an underlying problem with the unit. Therefore, call a professional immediately before the unit is damaged beyond repair. Bad odor and unusually high billsYou might also experience unusually bad odors emancipating from the air conditioner units which is a sure sign of a serious problem. A musty or stale odor could be an indication of mold in the inner surfaces of the unit that must be cleaned immediately. On the other hand, a burnt and pungent smell could indicate burned wire insulation. In both these cases, it is important to switch off the unit immediately and call a professional for servicing as quickly as you can. Moreover, ensure to call only a licensed professional for air conditioner repairs in Jacksonville, FL. An unusually high power bill is another indicating factor that your air conditioner unit needs to be maintained and repaired. Outdated and old AC units can also increase your energy bills, as modern AC units are energy-efficient and saves on power bills.

However, once y...", "word-count": 966, "body": "Until you become a consistent winning online poker player, your main concern should be developing a strong set of starting hand standards and learning how to play those cards properly. However, once you reach the next level of your poker game you should begin to look beyond your own cards and try to find additional methods of extracting the most profit out of your opponents. Of course, you won’t have the advantage of picking up physical tells when playing on the internet, but there are a few simple online poker tells that you can pick up on if you know what to look for. You can also give off tells to confuse observant opponents. The first, and most obvious, online poker tell is the use of pre-selected actions in the poker software. These usually exist in the form of “check/fold”, “check any”, “call any”, “call/raise any”, and “raise any”. Some software has more options than others but the check/fold button is pretty universal. Watch for players that use this – especially out of the big blind. You’ll know when a player uses it by seeing an instant check when it gets to their turn. This usually indicates a very weak hand.  Since the big blind had to put it money regardless of his hand, he’ll usually be holding trash. If you see an instant check preflop and a quick check on the flop, go ahead and bet out regardless of the board. Much more often than not you’ll pick up the small pot right there. This works especially well when there’s a face card on the board. Of course, you can manipulate this by occasionally clicking the “check any” from the big blind when you have a strong hand. Your opponents will believe that you clicked “check/fold” and you can set them up for a check-raise on the flop. On the other hand, you might occasionally see someone put in an immediate raise. This happens most often in limit hold’em, and you should be wary when you see this at your table as it usually indicates a strong hand. This can be also be used as a bluff if you don’t overdo it. Some of your opponents are also savvy enough to use this as a bluff so think about fighting back if you see this move from a frequent bluffer. Another important tell in online poker is the time it takes for your opponent to take an action. If your opponent always acts quickly on his turn and then suddenly hesitates when you bet into him he’s giving you a huge tell. He’s letting you know that he doesn’t have a simple decision. Use this information along with any notes you have taken on the player to help you make a decision. A long pause and then a check usually indicates weakness whereas a long pause and then a bet/raise usually indicates strength. My favorite way to manipulate this is by hesitating and then just calling when I’m in position on the flop or turn. This conveys that I’m probably on a draw and usually elicits another bet when they think that I missed or still drawing. At this point, you can throw in a raise. Of course, you should realize that better opponents will also do the same thing. You can also find out if your opponents are playing at multiple tables. If your particular poker room software doesn’t have a Find Player feature, just look around at tables of similar limits. If you find them at 3 or 4 other games, this can affect your strategy. Multi-table players are usually a bit more distracted and don’t have time to make sophisticated plays. They usually play more of a straightforward game so you can get a fairly quick read on their style. Remember to take notes and try playing more aggressively against them to take advantage of their distraction. The chat box may also give you insights on your opponents. If a player is constantly chatting it up he probably isn’t paying as much attention to his game. Another common occurrence you’ll see is a player steaming about a bad beat, swearing, and being an overall nuisance so you can obviously peg him for being on tilt. Opponents who like to downplay the strength of their hand are usually holding a strong hand. I don’t recommend trying to fool the table using the chat since it’s just downright childish and players can easily mute your commentary. On a side note, I find that disabling the chat altogether helps cut the annoyance factor in half. Finally, and this is the least credible tell you can pick up, is the player name/avatar chosen by an opponent. Players with the word “TILT”, a picture of a fish, a wacky face, or similarly loose-seeming characteristics are often tight and conservative players. As I said, this isn’t completely reliable but these visuals tend to somehow dig their way into poor players’ subconscious. Occasionally, you can elicit that extra call or two when you have the nuts just by portraying a loose style visually. In online poker, psychology doesn’t factor in nearly as much as at a brick and mortar cardroom but there are certain tells you can still pick up on and manipulate. Remember that the instantaneous check usually means weakness so try it sometime when you’ve got pocket Aces. Watch betting time such as the slow check (weak) and slow raise (strong). Keep an eye out for multi-tablers, and go for the throat on chat box tilters. Finally, “FishyFred” could be a better screen name choice if you want the occasional extra call. Remember, master your online poker game first and then take your game to the next level by spotting weaknesses and tells around the virtual table.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/hobbies/simple-online-poker-tells.html"},

The first thing you should do in any plumbing situation is to never attempt to fix it yourself, but get in touch with a plumber so that you know the situation will be dealt with by a trained expert. Still, having questions is perfectly normal, and you can satiate your curiosity without diving into the plumbing system yourself. After you get in touch with a plumber for Mornington Peninsula service, or a plumber in your area, you can check out some of these questions frequently asked by homeowners who are having issues with their plumbing systems. Some of these questions may even answer common problems that you can handle yourself, but if the situation is something you can’t handle on your own, getting in touch with a plumber for Mornington services should be at the top of your list. How do I unclog my toilet? This is something you can easily do on your own. The simplest way to handle this task is to pick up a plunger, but if you don’t have one available to you, you can fill up your toilet with dish soap and boiling water, let it sit in the bowl for a few minutes, and then flush. The idea here is that the hot water will be enough to get through the clog, while the soap washes everything down the drain. Should I check for leaks if my water bill is going up unexpectedly? If there is no obvious reason your water bill is going up, it could be due to a leak somewhere in your plumbing system. Give your faucets a look to see if they are leaking small amounts of water through constant dripping, and check your toilet to see if it is constantly running (this can be due to a broken seal in the tank). If you’re not finding any obvious signs, the leak could be somewhere in the plumbing system itself, which will require a call to plumbing services pros to find and fix. Why is there sewage coming from the toilet? Noticing sewage coming from the toilet is normally caused by a backup in your sewage line, and is a problem that should be dealt with quickly before it gets even worse. If you notice this problem, get in touch with a plumber to come out and fix the problem as soon as possible. How often should I have my plumbing system checked? You should have a professional come and check out your system at least once every two years, or whenever you detect a problem that needs to be addressed by a plumber. Having professional plumbing services check your system routinely is a great way to make sure it stays in tip-top shape to service you for years to come. The More You KnowNow that you know some of the answers to common questions related to plumbing issues, you should have a better idea of what to do when issues arise. Remember, you never want to try to handle serious plumbing issues by yourself, as this could only make the issue worse.

{"heading": "Solid Planks Flooring- How Wide", "author": "rashid6802501", "description": "The word 'wide plank flooring' refers to the solid wood flooring sold in planks that are particularly wider than 2 / 1-4-4 inch wide boards, which make up the vast majority of the market for wood flooring.", "word-count": 998, "body": "The word 'wide plank flooring' refers to the  sold in planks that are particularly wider than 2 / 1-4-4 inch wide boards, which make up the vast majority of the market for wood flooring. While all wood flooring now tends to be 4 inches wide with wide planks, true wide flooring, with boards ranging from 6 to 20 inches wide, is a relatively small subset of the hardwood flooring market. The vintage wide slab floorboards were made of hand-scratched solid wood boards, so they typically have a rough surface texture. It is possible to buy wide-plated floorboards as maintenance boards, but many manufacturers offer new boards that aim to reproduce the disturbing, rough vintage structure of the original milling process. With the same hard, smooth texture as found on other , newly made wide plaques can also be removed. Compared to other types of wood flooring, the width of the boards is why wide slab flooring is particularly expensive. Wide boards also require the visual proportionality of longboards. Achieving this wide and longboard means that a limited number of trees are suitable and there is considerable waste in milling such boards from trees. Because they are scarce compared to suitable trees, solid hardwood boards 10 to 20 inches wide are extremely costly. Since the branches are not appropriate, real broad planks are often cut from the trunk of the tree. The relative scarcity and expense of new big planks are why most of the recycled wood boards are committed to this industry acquisition. Because of the existence of the source trees, even for reclaimed timber, planks made from oak, hakurei, and other hardwoods do not exceed 10 inches by 12 inches. Wide-Plank Cost for Flooring: Real large slab floors are particularly more expensive than other forms of wood flooring, both for materials and labor. To pick the parts for the recovered wood to be mounted, to suit the grain of the wood, and to avoid capping and gaping between the boards. There are good skills needed. For single material, the cost of 12 to $ 50 per square foot is common for large plank hardwood floors made of new solid wood. It is a little easier to have large slab flooring, measuring 10 feet per square foot, but the price depends on the wood type. This makes wood flooring more costly than all other flooring materials, relative to the cost of 2 to $ 5 per square foot for solid narrow board hardwood. For wide slab floor installation, intend to add at least $ 2 per square foot. Compared to new planks, installation can cost more than recycled flooring, and flooring with arbitrarily large boards is especially laborious to install. Repair and Maintenance: As for every wooden floor, daily maintenance of a large wooden floor is the same. Sprinklers should be cleaned immediately, and you should never clean the floor with water or steam. With a wet duster and hardwood floor cleaner, the easiest way is to sweep. Broad plank flooring can, like any wood flooring, be coated from time to time with polyurethane varnish. Replace some of the bad boards if possible, if necessary. With a wide plank floor, repairs are not easy and will likely require a professional. Like any wood flooring, it is possible to sand and re-clean wide slab floors torenovate them, but if the boards are attached to the face during installation, this is a bit more complicated. Design: The appearance of vintage floorboards doesn't suit every style of home. It's fine to shape, particularly deep tops and highly textured (or disturbing) surfaces, makes it suitable for home or rustic decor in the traditional style. Smooth and stripped  are slowly making their way into more modern and contemporary style homes in light colors at the same time. On the wide planks, Swedish-style, wooden-centric homes look great. Another benefit of wide flooring, in addition to the style matching, is that it means fewer seams between the boards. Dean McMillan of Carlisle Wide Plank Floor says, 'The lines aren't too much of a barrier, and you can see the vertical grain better,' This is for floors that respect timber only. ' Installing Wide Plank Flooring: Extensive slab flooring, particularly if it is recovered on a vintage floor, is best done by professional staff. In order to deal with the grip and cracking of the boards and to install the boards without gaps, the reclaimed floor needs considerable skill. For most DIYers, the new wide slab floor, while easy to install, is still not recommended. Such floors are often installed with boards of random width, which require special installation skills. Methods for installation depend on how the board is engineered. Typically the edges of the tongue and groove are on the floor of the newly created broad plaque, and the plates are mounted much like the small living and groove boards with finishes that have nails in the tongue on the edges of the boards. They nail the blinds at an angle. Broad plates recovered also do not have tongues and grooves. These are usually the top of the board and the floor joists with nailed faces. The balance has changed over the years from incomplete flooring to prefabricated on-site flooring that is assembled before shipping to the plant. A prefabricated floor is a match made in heaven for self-employed individuals who like dry labor (cutting floorboards and stapling them) but hate jobs based on smelly chemicals. Many factory-made tiles, however, have a hard shell that must be chemically stripped first if you ever want to sand and clean again. A site-prepared floor has another benefit: seam filling. If the floorboards are laid, thin seams between the boards are still available that allow moisture to penetrate. The worst enemy of natural wood flooring is water. The varnish fills in the center of the seam when the wood floor is removed from the site, serving as a buffer between the exterior elements and the fragile floor bottom.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/home-repair/solid-planks-flooring-how-wide.html"},

At Alpha Roofing, our experts have identified some crucial factors from our experience and here they are out for you:", "word-count": 458, "body": "1. Roofing MaterialAsphalt shingles are preferred over other roofing materials because of the balance it provides between durability, beauty, and energy-efficiency. Though asphalt shingle roofing is very long-lasting, they don't last as long as some high-end options like tile and metal roofs.2. Weather ElementsRoofing systems in some areas are more prone to damage from natural elements such as strong winds, rains, hail, and tornadoes. These can damage parts of a roof or even entirely collapse them.3. Roof SlopeA good roofing system is one that does not allow ponding over a certain limit. One factor that determines the amount of ponding is the slope of the roof. In general, flat roofs are better at avoiding ponding issues than low slope ones. 4. Exposure to SunlightRoofs with darker shades tend to absorb more energy that may accelerate their wear and tear. In some cases, it can even cause roof degradation. But, the good news is that modern roofs are designed to resist UV light without compromising on the aesthetic appeal. 5. Poor VentilationIf the ventilation in the attic is poor, asphalt shingles can heat up from the inside and cause damage to the structure of the roof. Moreover, it can also result in condensation that usually results in moisture damage to the wooden roof deck. 6. Poor InsulationBad insulation can make your attic excessively hot that can damage your roof structure over time. This coupled with poor ventilation is a disaster for any roofing system.  7. Bad WorkmanshipPoor quality workmanship is a major cause behind most roof failures. No matter the quality of the roofing material you choose, if there are defects in installation, it can lead to premature failure of the roof. 8. Irregular MaintenanceEven the strongest roofing materials need constant care and a strict maintenance schedule. If you do not follow a good maintenance plan and as a result face a repair, even the roof warranty could be deemed invalid. 9. Age of Your Roofing SystemEvery roof has an age up to which it can serve effectively.

Many leading office furniture manufacturers have introduced multi-purposeful desks, cubicles, chairs, and other furniture sets that immensely enhance the productivity of workplaces.Here I am going to list few office furniture trends that immensely help in escalating the productivity.   The contemporary workplaces are majorly focusing on the altogether office outcomes, so we can see flat and less hierarchy in offices. Accordingly, manufacturers are designing the modular desks that effectively facilitate the casual collaborations in work premises. As modular desks can be grouped or organized in multiple configurations.Starting from CEO to all executive grades, each employee needs a tablet to answer the emails, research, and examine the workflows.  To fulfill these criteria manufacturers are integrating both executive chairs and tuck-away tablets, hence the staff can conveniently work with their smartphones and iPads.Internet browsing, email checking, and answering the call are the casual requirements of each and every employee. Hence offering of comfortable seating choices to the staff in the break rooms, and lobby locations ensure to greatly solace them.    Efficiency is the paramount constraint that any firm demands from an employee. Now many US companies are giving more priority to the intellectual property of workplaces in order to encourage the creative works.  So the present day office furniture sets are designed to be more colorful with numerous artistic options.Many of the today’s companies are smaller, hence each employee is considered as a great asset to the company. Therefore, managers work hard to keep the employees with the company for a long time. To accomplish this goal, offering the comfortable work environment to the staff is certainly required in terms of providing the soft seating, ergonomically designed equipment, , and comfortable chairs.The proliferation of companies across the globe has enabled the employees to work from remote locations and homes. Meanwhile, there is a lot of difference between regular office furniture, and home use office furniture, as the later one has a space limitation than the former one. Eventually, quality, comfort, and appeal are the three major constraints that must be considered before buying home office desks, computer table, and other office furniture items to bring out maximum efficiency from the employee.In the olden days, a worker needs only one , but the technology advancements have changed the office furniture usage as well. Every employee is liable to simultaneously use the computer, smartphone, and tablet.

That's why employing the expertise of a mold removal specialist, who knows how to remove mold safely and correctly, is essential.Mold will survive and grow so long as it has an organic food source and water. Therefore, when water enters a building by a flood or leak, this creates the perfect atmosphere for mold because of the moisture created. Molds also find their organic food sources in the broken down and saturated materials in carpet fibers, drywall and wood. Over time, this mold can destroy a building by causing structural damage; not to mention all of the major health concerns it can create, too.In any area damaged by water, growing right along with mold are what's called 'gram negative' and 'gram positive' bacteria. Just like mold, they require moisture and organic material to thrive, and the synergistic action between mold and bacteria further increase and worsen inflammatory health conditions. The positive gram bacteria consist of several different varieties: bacilli, cocci, streptomyces, and actinomycetes. The actinomycetes contain several different groups of bacteria, including mycobacterium tuberculosis, which can cause very serious lung infection.Mold isn't the only threat from flooding. Raw sewage may have contaminated certain flooded areas, which can cause dangerous gastrointestinal and skin infections. Avoid wading around unprotected in such areas, and do not drink potentially contaminated water. Water damage itself can also spawn pathogenic bacteria unrelated to sewage contamination.If your home was flooded, you'd be well advised to hire a pro.

You have to be aware that various kinds of problems should be managed with different cleaning preparations.During vacuuming, divide the floor into sections to make vacuuming easier. This allows you to concentrate on areas more carefully without repeatedly going over the same spots. If the room you are cleaning is square, you can break it up into four parts.When vacuuming, divide the room into smaller sections to make your job easier. This helps them see what they went over already and helps avoid wasted time. Moving all of the furniture out of the room you are having professionally cleaned can be very helpful.You may think that a carpet cleaning company only cleans your carpets; however, they usually provide other services also. They can also clean furniture, so look into this if it is a service that you need. You may even find a company that is currently running a carpet/upholstery cleaning promotion.Always vacuum any carpet before cleaning it. Use your vacuum to remove any lose dirt from your carpet before using cleaning products or water. Your results won’t be great if the products are applied to a carpet that’s full of loose dirt. After treating a stain, do not vacuum the area until it is fully dry.Always move fragile items yourself before the company arrives to clean. You do not want to entrust your valuables with someone else, even if they have given you their word nothing will go wrong.Test the solution that you are preparing to use on your carpet on a small portion that is not noticeable in your room. This is very important to do because there are acids in some cleaners that may damage a rug permanently.

Some carpet companies might surprise you regarding their level of service. Do some research to get the best results with a cleaning company.For a quick clean-up, apply some white vinegar directly on a stain on your carpet. Since this does not sanitize your carpet, it is best to hire a carpet cleaning company to do the job. This will help remove the surface dirt before the professional cleaners arrive.It is important to be aware that using cleaning solvents and chemicals to clean your carpet means that your family is exposed to the same substances in your home. You should always read the labels of the cleaning products you use and consider using an environment-friendly solution such as vinegar, salt or baking soda or rinsing your carpet thoroughly to get rid of chemicals.If your carpets have deep stains, then you need a  professional. Home cleaning solutions cannot remove everything, but professionals (in most cases) can remove tough stains like red wine, blood and melted wax. This is done in a meticulous way to preserve the integrity of your carpet.If you are looking into having your carpets cleaned, you should understand how the pricing structure works.

{"heading": "Innevoice PC - WHY WE PROCRASTINATE", "author": "Shalvic Kelly", "description": "We all procrastinate – each one of us – so firstly, there is no room for shame or stigma in the", "word-count": 860, "body": "We all procrastinate – each one of us – so firstly, there is no room for shame or stigma in the  although many of us feel shame when we procrastinate. Perhaps we feel shame because our productivity-obsessed culture often labels the behavior of procrastination as ‘lazy’, and it takes almost super-human ego strength not to internalize such strong messages to some degree. For our purposes, let’s first try to set the shame aside in recognizing that universality of the experience or procrastination.We are all unique, with our own experiences of procrastination, but contemporary research suggests that one of the most common correlations with procrastinating is not laziness, but perfectionism. Personally, perfectionism is not the first word that comes to mind when I think of laziness, and I certainly see no shame in wanting things to be done excellently, but sometimes perfectionism leads to paralysis, and can lead others to view perfectionists as lazy.The research that exposes perfectionism at the root of procrastination is congruent with a century-old assumption that Carl Jung, the Swiss founder of analytical psychology, suggests: any symptom (unwanted pattern of thoughts, feelings, or behaviors that negatively impact our quality of life) can be considered a replacement for legitimate suffering. It’s important to note that when he uses the term ‘legitimate’, he means that the pain experienced is close to the core of our problem, not that one form of pain is more valid than another. For some of us, to tackle a task exposes us to the risk of doing something that is below our expectations of ourselves, and to get too close to the negative feelings experienced during the task would be too much for our conscious selves to stand. So instead, we choose to do something else that might scratch our itch of needing to feel productive, or we choose to do something that provides escapism.For example, perhaps you’ve experienced a strong desire to pick up a musical instrument in your adulthood, yet the instrument has sat in the corner of your living room for two years. Though time has passed, the desire to play the instrument hasn’t decreased any, and you still mention to friends in conversations that you’d like to learn to play, you just can’t quite bring yourself to do it. As you kick the can down the road, you may find yourself using replacement behaviors. These behaviors often are productive like laundry, dusting, dishes, or something else that has little to no risk for emotional distress. You also may turn to escapism like substances, sex and masturbation, fantasy, gaming, or social media. These replacement behaviors allow our conscious selves to feel either immediately successful in terms of productivity, or they distract us from the threatening feelings we would experience if we were doing the avoided task. Perhaps not picking up the musical instrument and instead doing something else is allowing your conscious self to avoid the legitimate suffering experiences when you don’t sound as good as you’d like to for months as you work your way through the learning process. Maybe this negative feeling is big enough to be threatening to the ego, so much so that it is unconsciously more desirable to procrastinate.Or perhaps you’re avoiding a difficult conversation with an individual you know would beneficial. When opportunities arise, you may find yourself using the replacement behavior of changing the subject to something more superficial, or maybe overloading your time with the individual with activities to eliminate the opportunity for deep conversation. Perhaps the legitimate suffering you’d experience if you confronted the individual would contain considerable anxiety that the relationship will not be able to survive the confrontation. Maybe you’re afraid of the guilt you may feel if you own your own shortcomings in the relationship. Maybe these feelings that are closer to the core of your problem are large enough that you choose to avoid the suffering and replace it with another more palatable choice – another ‘what’s new’ or ‘how’s the weather’ conversation.Using Jung’s lens to view our procrastination can lead to insight and breakthrough. What would happen if we asked ourselves in moments of procrastination and avoidance, “what painful emotional experience, what suffering, or what big, unpleasant feeling or negative belief will I confront if I dig into the task I’m avoiding”? Might we uncover the expectation of some suffering that has roots that run below the surface of our usual justifications we use for procrastination?If we ask ourselves this question in our moments of kicking the can down the road and identify the legitimate suffering the avoided task contains, we may bring to consciousness the unconscious drives that keep us stuck in our procrastination patterns. If we meet these insights with self-compassion, we can develop the necessary libido to courageously move through the legitimate suffering, leading to transformative change and personal growth. When all else fails, remember these two things: Done is better than perfect, and you’re never going to feel like it!  Want updates from InnerVoice ?

{"heading": "Working on Carpet Cleaning and How to Make It Better", "author": "Ma. Theresa Galan", "description": "Give your carpet's dirtiest spots and spills attention first. Here's the thing about carpeting: the plush, dense fibers we love to feel underfoot are also really great at clinging to dust, dirt, smoke, pet odor, and whatever other grime comes through the door.", "word-count": 490, "body": "Dense fibers we love to feel underfoot are also really great at clinging to dust, dirt, smoke, pet odor, and whatever other grime comes through the door, that is carpet. Though there can be an easy way of maintaining it, you just need to learn the one two three on how to do it right. Theories can help. Regular vacuuming is your carpet's best friend. Dirt is gritty, and actually wears at the fibers.' Vacuum at least once a week, and more often if you have pets, allergies, or lots of dirty-foot traffic. Place mats at doors and institute a no-shoe policy indoors.It is possible to clean carpet reasonably well with a machine you rent. That said, you should also recognize that a good professional probably would do a better job. And if you anticipate tackling the job frequently on your own, you might be better off buying a deep-cleaning machine, which works similarly to the rental machines.With all of these options, the basic cleaning method is the same. Although it's often called steam cleaning, the process doesn't use actual steam. First a solution of detergent and water is spread over the carpet and worked into the fibers. Then it is rinsed out -- along with the grime -- by vacuuming up as much moisture as possible.One factor that dragged down the score for the rental machines: Their quality varied considerably. If you're a novice at carpet cleaning, this is a big issue. If a machine not in good repair dumps too much detergent onto the carpet, for example, you might just keep going, assuming that's what it's supposed to do.Buying a deep-cleaning machine gets around this problem, assuming you take the time to read the directions and take reasonable care of the tool.Carpet manufacturers generally recommend professional cleaning of carpets every 12 to 18 months. But if you have indoor pets, track in oily dirt from a garage floor, or find lots of sticky things spilled on your carpet, renting a machine or buying one for interim cleanings makes sense. If, after several DIY cleanings, the fibers don't seem to be as clean as they once were, you can always call in a pro for a more thorough job.Professionals with truck-mounted equipment have the edge in several ways. Because they clean carpets day after day, they aren't as likely to make mistakes such as using too much detergent or neglecting to rinse away all residue. Also, the trucks deliver hot water, which boosts the detergent's effectiveness. With a rental machine, the best you can do is to pour hot water into the mixing tank and hope it doesn't cool off too much as you clean. Finally, professionals benefit from having more powerful vacuum systems. Because they remove more water, it's possible to rinse more thoroughly.Seek the appropriate PRO's who can help you not only do the thing, but do it effectively.

We've called in the  experts to find out exactly what draws pests to your home, so you can stop an infestation before it happens!Find the list below:MoistureDampness attracts pests of many different types. 'We need water in our everyday lives, but so do the pests,' says Cherie Hartzer, an entomologist for Orkin. 'Even small amounts dripping from an air conditioner unit may attract wasps that are foraging for water. Water that has soaked into wood is attractive to termites. Downspouts and gutters that are holding water can be perfect habitats for mosquitoes. A dripping faucet may attract rodents, especially if it has been dry and there aren't other water sources around.' Spilled FoodSpills happen—but if even a little bit of the mess is left behind, the bugs simply can't resist. 'Spilled food crumbs in your kitchen contain a veritable feast for insects such as cockroaches and ants,' Smith says. Regular cleanups—including moving and vacuuming behind the stove and the refrigerator—can help make your kitchen a whole lot less palatable to pests.Undisposed GarbageThe smell of garbage may be completely unpleasant to your nose, but for bugs like flies, it's like a siren call. You probably already know the secret to stopping this—contain your garbage. 'Make sure when you take out the trash it is bagged and the trash bin is tightly closed,' Hartzer says. That'll also help keep other pests attracted by garbage, such as mice and raccoons, away as well.Left Over FoodsThough it should come as no surprise, pests of all kinds are after your leftovers. That's why, according to Lazarus, you should do your best to curb the amount of food left out in the open in your home. 'Store food in airtight containers and always avoid leaving food out—including in pet bowls, which many people don't think about,' he says.There are more other factors out there but these mentioned factors is of utmost consideration if you want your house to be out of those pests.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/free/how-to-get-easy-on-pest-inside-the-house.html"},

Speed can also prevent a stain from appearing in the first place. Once you notice a blemish, move quickly. While vacuuming on a regular basis will keep your carpet from looking dingy and dirty, tough stains are something that even the new of best vacuum can't handle. Whatever the problem, there's a specific solution or  product to make your area look brand-new.Vacuum slowly enough to get out as much dirt as possible. Make one quick pass over low-traffic areas and two slow passes over high-traffic areas. Two slow passes removes ground-in dirt more effectively than several fast passes.Dirt is like thousands of little blades that cut carpet fibers. When you walk across a dirty carpet, you grind sharp dirt particles against the yarn, making tiny nicks in the fibers. All that fuzz mixed in with the dirt in your vacuum cleaner bags is your beautiful carpet headed out the door one bag at a time. When dirt scratches the fibers, it dulls the sheen, which is why high-traffic areas appear duller than the rest of the carpet. Over time, grinding dirt wears away the fibers too, which mats them down and makes them stain more easily. Most carpet manufacturers recommend professional hot water extraction as the primary cleaning method for synthetic carpets. Although it’s often referred to as “steam” cleaning, there’s no steam involved. The carpet is pretreated with a detergent solution, and then a very hot rinse solution under high pressure is forced into your carpet and vacuumed out. When done correctly, this process cleans deep and doesn’t leave behind a soap residue. Call a professional to rid your carpet of ground-in dirt if you cannot do so yourself.

For many people, the list may include features such as: A double garage.A spare room for guestsA hot tub.An en suite with every bedroom.A playroom.A study.This is your wants list Step twoNow imagine that you are going to be renting somewhere for a while, and write down what you really need. This list might include the following: A bedroom for each child.A living area was big enough for your furniture.A garage or adequate private parking.A private, secure garden where your dog can exercise.A shared bathroom conveniently situated between two or three bedrooms.More storage space.Potential to extend.This is your needs list.  Step threeNow, look at what properties in your price bracket have to offer, and how they could be adapted to meet your needs and maybe a few of your wants. For example, a wooden cabin in the garden could function as a study or playroom. You may be able to fit in a bedroom for each child if some of them are single rather than double rooms. Also, consider the implications of the needs and wants list for the type of property you should look at. Basic type: house, bungalow, flat, mobile home.Kind of house: detached, semi-detached, and terraced.Kind of flat: ground floor, first or top floor, penthouse, converted or purpose-built.Bedrooms: how many you need, and how many must be double.Bathrooms/toilets: how many you need.What other rooms you need: study, lounge, kitchen/diner, separate dining room.Garden: small, medium, large, with lawn, general condition.Parking requirements: off-street, in a garage or carport, for how many cars.Consider different types of propertyWith your list of needs and wants as a brief, you can now consider which type or types of property are best suited to meet your requirements. Keep your mind open to all possibilities at this stage: you may have pictured yourself living in a Victorian cottage when, in fact, a new-build modern home ticks more of the boxes on your list.  New trendsPrivate builders are often obliged to include a wider range of properties, including starter homes in ‘mixed developments,’ in return for receiving planning permission. Since 2005 the Government has announced several initiatives to increase the supply of affordable housing, including support for buying a property first-time and key workers such as nurses and teachers. Their view is based on: ‘A fundamental principle of sustainable communities is that everyone should have the opportunity of a decent home at a price they can afford, in a place in which they want to live and work Buying a new propertyBuying a new property could allow you to meet many of the requirements on your needs and wants lists. First, developers tend to gear their properties to what the market is demanding, and also, if you get involved early enough, you can influence the planning and layout of your new home. There are a number of benefits to buying a new property. If you opt for a new-build property, do not use a legal firm provided by the developer as there could be conflict of interest. Get an independent specialist who is experienced in this area and familiar with issues such as, if the property is correctly built on its plot or not. Since 2007, lenders have been nervous to lend on some new build properties. As a result, you may have to pay up to a 40 percent deposit on such property until lenders have more money for people to borrow and the property market has stabilized. On the other hand, new builds often charge up to 20 percent price premium over other secondhand homes, apart from character properties. While the property market is in the doldrums, this level of premium isn’t always charged, so if you can afford the deposit, new builds can represent increasingly good value for money. Many new builds also have the advantage of offers when buying a property for the first time.  : St. James Investments helps property owners who need to sell in a hurry. We always offer cash.

{"heading": "Contemporary Kitchen Trends from Milan Design Week 2019", "author": "Luxerior Interior Designs", "description": "Welcome to Luxerior Blogs. Let’s talk about the Combinations and Materials that can inspire you to design a contemporary kitchen, especially if your kitchen has an open space concept.", "word-count": 726, "body": "1. Simple + Clean LinesContemporary design is clean and minimal. Contemporary kitchen cabinets generally have minimal ornamentation and simple but stylish hardware and no other decorative accents. In terms of colors, contemporary kitchen cabinets may often have a monochromatic color scheme. These colors give a clean appearance which characterizes a contemporary style. This clean appearance and minimal style are perfect to be used when the kitchen shares the space with other areas like your living or dining room. This way the simplicity of the cabinetry can match better with all the contemporary decor and furniture that confirm the space.It’s important to have multiple storage spaces to maintain the kitchen clean. Open shelving is another favorite at the time of designing a contemporary kitchen for displaying the personality of homeowner.You can include beautiful and stylish pieces of your dining room, your kitchen books or other accessories that you usually use in your kitchen but at the same time they can be used as decorative pieces.2. IslandsIslands are crucial elements when it comes to contemporary kitchens. Islands tend to become a gathering spot in the kitchen and especially if there is seating. It can also serve as a spot where kids can do their homework while parents are cooking. It can help your family engaged and connected so it’s very important to make your island work properly for your needs.Look around and figure out exactly what your kitchen needs. May be you need additional storage space or a place to have breakfast or share with your guest while cooking dinner. Just make your kitchen island complement and complete your kitchen, maintaining functionality and visual harmony with your entire home.The idea of an open concept kitchen is very common in modern and contemporary homes. So we are seeing a tendency of kitchen islands extending into living room spaces in homes. This ensures the kitchen island can be multi-functional and is a part of whole composition of the space.Accessorizing it is important as well. The use of a pendant lights are a must have to define the area and to add character to the open space.If your kitchen shares the space with dining or living room, remember to select pieces that speak to one another across the space. May be color of your stool speaks to the color or your pillow, or wall art in the living room. This will create a visual flow and provide a cohesive atmosphere.3. Bold FixturesThe kitchen fixtures aren’t only a functional element anymore. Now they are artistic pieces and crucial elements to define your kitchen style. Unique accessories add character to the space and are perfect to complement a contemporary color palette in a very chic way. Let’s try some combinations, if you have a white kitchen with a clean and contemporary appearance, try to incorporate black matte fixtures to make a high contrast and accentuate those elements.If you have wooden finishes with concrete tiles and black matte textured combinations, you can add golden matte fixtures and details to make it pop.Be creative and don’t forget to add a bold fixture to complete your contemporary home design.4. TexturesWhen embarking on a contemporary kitchen design, consider the use of textured material in combination with smooth and polished finishes. Textures are applied to cabinets, doors, worktops or floors. By introducing textural finishes to sensory experience, both visual and tactile is enhanced in a contemporary kitchen.Don’t be afraid to mix and match textures. The combination of textures in contemporary kitchens are bold dramatic, for example: wooden floor tiles with a marble counter-top. Concrete, mate cabinets, wood and gold together.Include in your kitchen lots of materials with textures because they are tactile elements that will give any kitchen a bit of warmth and history.5. Matte FinishesMatte finishes are a popular favorite for using in all the area of a contemporary home, and even more in bathrooms, and kitchens. This sleek finish is used in tiles, fixtures, accessories, countertop or backsplash. Since high gloss finishes are the quickest to show stains or scratches, matte finishes became popular because it’s not necessary to clean their surfaces as often.Matte finishes are perfect for natural and rustic looks and are perfect for combining with wooden textures. Matt finishes produce a stunning, sleek and contemporary look that adds a level of sophistication and authenticity to the space.More Picture Reference @ Blogs @ Website:", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/free/contemporary-kitchen-trends-from-milan-design-week-2019.html"},
{"heading": "How to access tenants before accommodating them", "author": "Neil parmer", "description": "If being completely honest, most landlords can probably admit to allowing a tenant to move into a property without undertaking particularly thorough checks. Maybe the tenancy went well, or maybe with hindsight, it was the most foolish thing you ever did!", "word-count": 863, "body": "If being completely honest, most landlords can probably admit to allowing a tenant to move into a property without undertaking particularly thorough checks. Maybe the tenancy went well, or maybe with hindsight, it was the most foolish thing you ever did!Referencing your potential tenant is a vital part of the tenancy process. It is like undertaking a risk assessment for your business; it is not foolproof but will in all likelihood reduce the risks that you may otherwise be exposed to.So if we are in agreement that referencing should take place, what sort of information should we look at?Well, the first step is to find a suitable tenant to put through the referencing process. It sounds obvious but there are lots of things to keep an eye open for on a viewing that may highlight that the viewer is perhaps not the tenant you are looking for.Examples I have had over the years include the 6'6' bodybuilder who asked whether he could putCCTV above the front door. Whilst I couldn't imagine he could be afraid of anyone, I did wonder whether he was expecting some unsavoury visitors! Another classic is the tenant who has to move in immediately. There is always a reason why, and you should try and find that out. Perhaps they are being evicted from their currentproperty, or the house they were due to take has just fallen through because they failed their referencing. Assess your viewer and they’re likely accommodation needs and is on the alert for strange questions that might suggest an ulterior motive.So now you have found someone you think is potentially suitable. My personal view is that you should now start with a credit score and financial profiling. This will show whether the tenant has any adverse credit, bankruptcy or IVA but will also give you an idea of their financial lifestyle. Many credit reports show the number ofbank accounts, the number of credit applications that have been made and the like, giving the landlord an indication of the potential tenant's behaviour.Be aware that you must have their written consent before diving into their credit file!Beyond this, an employment reference is imperative. You should ensure that the tenant earns a salary sufficient to cover the rent; as a broad guide, their salary should be at least 2.5 times the annual rent for the property. Additionally, if the employment is on a contract basis, ensure that the contract is due to outlast the tenancy period that you are about to grant.Most employment referencing enquires whether the post is permanent, whether there is any likelihood of impending redundancy, or indeed whether the job role will change  significantly in the coming 12 months. Landlords should be wary of employer email addresses that are non-business, and/or have the suffix Hotmail, Yahoo and the like. In such circumstances, telephone the company and ask for the contact details of the HR department. An employer's reference created by a friend of the tenant will be far less useful!With these complete, you should then obtain a reference from the current landlord. Questions should include whether the property was well maintained, whether the rent was paid on time and whether the landlord would rent to that tenant again in the future. Whilst I accept that some landlords, desperate to get rid of a troublesome tenant, may give them a growing reference my experience is that such actions form only a small minority.Regardless, the landlord reference in conjunction with the other information that you gather should start to paint a consistent picture of your prospective tenant.For some landlords, the above will be comprehensive enough, and indeed this is broadly what is undertaken by the referencing companies on behalf of letting agents. Should you wish to delve a little deeper then there are a couple of further safeguards that you may wish to consider.Home visits are conducted by some landlords to try and get an idea of how well a tenant maintains the property and their level of cleanliness. Whilst I can see the advantage in doing so it does feel a little intrusive and unless it's a spot visit they are likely to spring clean an hour before you arrive!I am also aware that a number of landlords ask tenants for three months' bank statements. Seeing the state of their account can be very useful. Payments being debited to payday lenders may indicate you have someone who is living beyond their means and who may therefore struggle to pay the rent.You will also be able to confirm their level of salary and the content of the employer's reference. This is particularly useful if the salary includes a commission or bonus element.Notwithstanding the above it is. important to acknowledge that this is a people business and it is therefore not possible to adopt a 'one size fits all' approach. By all means, exercise some discretion and latitude when selecting tenants, but remember that the referencing you have undertaken remains important as it will have highlighted the individuals to whom you may want to offer some latitude!: Having trouble looking for ?

{"heading": "With housing in short supply and house price growth continuing, the pendulum is swinging further tow", "author": "Neil parmer", "description": "As supply lags demand, there will be upward pressure on capital values and rents, which is good news for investors - at least for those landlords less affected by the raft of changes designed to take the heat out of the housing market.", "word-count": 683, "body": "The 3% addition to marginal stamp duty rates for second homes and buy-to-lets will mean having to put in significantly more equity for reduced returns. It would add £15,000 to the tax bill for purchasing a £500,000 residential property. Assuming you put down a 25% deposit, this would mean putting up 19% more cash. However, when holding for decades, this increase becomes less significant.A more significant penalty is the removal of mortgage interest tax allowance. This measure will be fully phased in by 2017. Investments owned by higher rate taxpayers, where mortgage interest exceeds 75% of the rent charged, will become loss-making under these changes. Additional tax relief for 'wear and tear' will also be substantially reduced.It will be interesting to see if this proposed measure will actually stick. Although welcomed by housing charities and tenant groups, it's certainly not popular with smaller landlords. Many argue that it discriminates in favor of corporate investors which would be exempt - particularly at a time when many pension funds and property companies have declared a serious intent to invest significantly in the private rented sector. Cherie Blair has picked up the baton. Omnia Strategy (her law firm) has challenged the tax changes, suggesting a breach of human rights. VIEW FROM THE ROSTRUMAt the moment, interest rates look stable - and current unease across global markets has put off any likelihood of a rate hike this year. Certainly the Bank of England fears that any rate rise would have a more damaging effect on landlords than owner occupiers; the BoE reports that buy-to-let lending was at 14.5% of gross new mortgage lending in Q3 2015, up from 8.8% in Q3 2007.Inevitably 2016 will see some landlords reconsider their investments and potentially disinvest. This would improve the flow of stock to the auction rooms. Only a mass exodus would contribute to a fall in house prices - and that is not going to happen. Cash-rich investors with nil or low loan to value debt requirements - perhaps swelled in number by those taking cash-free lump sums from their pensions - will pick up the slack. With pension reforms also culling the lifetime allowance from £1.2m to Rim, we could certainly see people moving money around in this way. Landlords with portfolios of 15 invest- mints or more are expected to be exempt from the 3% hike and are also likely to remain in the room.Our first catalogue of the year, for our 18 February sale, is now in the market. More than 330 lots will be offered. Compare that with 272 in February 2015 - an uplift of 21% by volume. It is clear from these figures -and also from our discussions with vendors - that a spike in demand is expected as some investors rush to beat the surcharge deadline.As a result, we'll certainly see a post-April lull as the market adjusts. But while these aggressive measures will never be viewed as welcome, it would be wise for the smaller investor to consider the bigger picture. With demand increasing and significant shortage in supply likely to endure, there's no indication that capital value appreciation in residential property is likely to cease in the medium term. Payment of additional SDLT is inconvenient but, at the present rate of house price inflation, is likely to be negated over months, not years.With our auction teams having enjoyed a stellar 2015, raising more than 1b gbp in sales, questions have inevitably been asked around the future for property, and residential in particular, but with so many changes afoot - and more to come - the year ahead is a hard one to call.While it is likely to be both an interesting and uncertain year, the landscape points to a shift in ownerships. And if there's one thing for certain, it's that we in the auction world very much like that. It is clear from the figures-and discussions with vendors - a spike in demand is expected as some investors rush to beat the surcharge Maximise Your Rental Income With  .

Arguably, however, the most important occurrence to emerge from this process is the increase to resale value. Many construction industry professionals maintain engaging in the following eight  can significantly increase the residence’s worth:Finish The Basement Basements that appear to be more than a damp, grimy space where old junk is stored are significant value-boosting assets. Homeowners have many choices when deciding how to transform this often untapped below-ground space. Contracting professionals opine basements often prove suitable locations for kids playrooms, additional bathrooms or media centers. Regardless, real estate officials recommend homeowners make some upgrades and never leave the space dark, dingy and fallow. Build A Home OfficeFor many businesses, telecommuting has become a viable option for a discernible percentage of said establishments staff. In fact, since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, working from home has been the norm in various industries. With such facts in mind, homes with built-in offices could prove extremely attractive. Such locations should be rife with open space to position furniture and electronic equipment, in addition to extra phone lines, data ports and electrical outlets.Perform A Kitchen MakeoverKitchen makeovers are among the most important home renovations for a property owner. Residents usually spend extended periods in this room to cook, eat and relax. Therefore, homes with inviting kitchens stand a far better chance of selling quickly and for top dollar than those that do not possess such attributes. Optimal kitchen upgrades should, at the very least, include the installation of new or renovated cabinets and drawers and modern, energy-efficient appliances.  Address The Bathroom Situation Though occasionally overlooked and undervalued, bathrooms are viewed as pertinent real estate within a home. Too few bathrooms or those appearing old or outdated may very well turn off prospective buyers. Therefore, should the home contain at least two or three washrooms, engaging in upgrades involves paint jobs, new flooring, and modern, water-conserving sinks, baths, and toilets. If the home in question lacks bathrooms, the property owner is strongly encouraged to add such locations.Increase Lighting Few issues prove more off-putting to potential home purchasers than a residence lacking the appropriate lighting. First and foremost, limited light could prove dangerous and precipitate avoidable injuries from falls or bumping into objects that cannot be seen. Furthermore, light provides natural illumination for a home and can accentuate existing positive attributes. Enhancing a home’s lighting capacity could be executed in several ways. First, electric fixtures can be installed.

Ignoring a few intelligent strategies could sometimes result in over-spending on your . In this blog, we share a few money-saving strategies for home buyers for the first time.Plan your BudgetYou should plan how much you are ready to spend on your home before you buy a  with its stylish features and attractive prospects. You must save sufficiently to pay the down payment and you must pay the EMIs well enough on your monthly income. Before taking a home loan, you must carefully analyze your family's income and spending. Also, be ready for the worst economic situations, such as job losses. Remember, your home loan should not become a bad debt for you.Avoid BiddingBuying an auction house is a good idea as most of the time you can find a good deal. But to win a bidding war, you should not act irrationally. Otherwise, you will end up spending more than you want to. Therefore you must decide how much you are prepared to pay for a particular house before you take part in an Auction. You should buy a house that has been in the market for a long time, as it is easy to negotiate its price rather than buy a home at an auction.Always NegotiateNegotiations are often a favorite way to get a discount on the price of your house. But for first-time buyers in the real estate market, negotiations can be difficult, but at least you can try. After all, there is no harm in asking for a discount. But you can do a detailed review of the property before approaching the real estate broker for negotiation. If there are some drawbacks in the property, like an awkward room design, or an old-style bathroom, can be found in this house. You can ask the property owner for a discount based on these factors.Don’t compare yourself to othersMost Indians collapse into contrast and desperation when buying a home. We also try to purchase a house that will boost our social renown among our families, friends, and colleagues. And we end up being overburdened by a heavier loan to win in this race. You should think of ways you can remain within your budget instead of becoming distracted with buying a house better than a friend or family.Buy the house with your spouseYou will save a huge amount of money on your stamp duty by purchasing a house with your wife.

If you don’t know anything about your unit, though, it can be nearly impossible to know for sure what is going on and what needs to be fixed. While you can and should find a trustworthy HVAC technician, not everyone has your best interest at heart. You don't want to be confused or taken advantage of when a technician arrives! Knowledge is power when it comes to hiring someone for a project around the house. With that in mind, let’s break down exactly what your unit is and what to expect from any type of service work. Knowing the Parts of a HVAC UnitTo understand the cost of a repair or replacement part, you need to understand exactly what your unit is made up of.

Your thermostat is where you could turn the system on or off, as well as adjust the exact temperature.Furnace: This part supplies heat and operates on either oil or natural gas sources. The heat exchanger is within the furnace, which is responsible for making the air warm.AC unit: This is the unit placed outside of your house. It uses electricity to operate. A compressor and coolant liquid inside extracts heat from the air. The hot air is dispersed outside and cooled air is contained inside.Ductwork: This is the transit system for hot and cold air. It connects the entire system together. This is responsible for moving temperature controlled air around the house. Think of it this way- your plumbing system has pipes and your HVAC system has ductwork. That's easy to understand! In general, all HVAC units have the above mentioned parts. This mentions the important basics, but it is far from an extensive list. There are still other aspects of the HVAC system, like a breaker and wires. However, these may differ from one system to another. It’s tough to be able to guess any type of cost estimate without a professional knowing the specifics of what your problem is. That is why it is best to pick up the phone and call someone! Reach out and let a HVAC technician know you need help, either just maintenance, a quick repair, or you think you may need a new unit. They’ll ask a few questions and book time to come out and see it in person. If you're able to answer the questions knowledgeably and confidently, it will make the entire process much easier.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/home-business/better-understand-your-air-conditioning-in-richmond-hill-ga.html"},

Make a proper budget for the work and then look for the services of packers and movers. You can also reduce the charges by providing packing material of your own or shifting at a time when there is no hike in the charges.

So always try to look at whether the company has branches all over India or not.Supervise the packers and movers according to yourself:Yes, packers and movers undoubtedly do all the work without taking any help from you but you must not leave all the things upon them. You should check on them very often and supervise them to do the work according to yourself so that you will not have to regret it later on. Ask every doubt you have in your mind to the company to clear everything and if you do not find something satisfying enough then you should not hire them.Check the strength of crew members and vehicles:Many times it happens that you book a company and then on the day of movement they tell you that they do not have enough staff or vehicles to do your work and postpone it which irritates you a lot. You should check the strength of the crew members and vehicles of the company before hiring it to avoid any problem on the day of shifting. Also, know about the experience of the crew members because the more the experience better service they will be doing.Compare quotes:Do not stick to any one company.

{"heading": "Warning - Do The No Sugar Challenge at Your Own Risk", "author": "Mary Melendez", "description": "This article explores the No Sugar Challenge, what it is, what it takes and what precautions to take when doing this challenge. It also outlines the proper way to go totally no sugar and finally kick that sugar addiction.", "word-count": 801, "body": "The No Sugar Challenge is basically to totally stop ingesting any form of added sugar, including sugar substitutes like stevia, for a period ranging from 1 week to 4 weeks. The notion is to kill your craving for sweets after going cold turkey on it. This is primarily working on the same principle of kicking the smoking, drug or even gambling habit. As we know, there are mixed views on how effective this method is in kicking off any of the above habits and we know how bad it can get when the withdrawal symptoms sets in.Sugar dependence can be or even more addictive than smoking, drug or gambling habits combined. That is, why, kicking off the sugar habit is one that is the most challenging and can cause many to fail. This leads to a spiral of feelings of hopelessness, despair and eventually caving in and give up. That is why I am issuing this warning to all those who are thinking of taking up this challenge. As it stands, The No Sugar Challenge is in a word simply too simplistic and mechanical. Cut out the sugar for a period of time, the craving stops and everything is happily ever after. This is not so. I know, for I have been through it. About 5-6 years ago, I was gorging on 3litres of sodas and 4 cups of coffee a day. You read it right, 2 bottles of 1.5litres of 100plus or sodas a day, potatoe chips every other day. I was stressed and these relieve me of them. I only started to really face up to it and make a determined decision to be free of this addiction when told by my doctor that i am on a borderline to get diabetes and may have to take medication for the rest of my life. He gave me 3 months to see whether I can bring the sugar levels down before deciding to prescribe medication. That really woke me up and I started on this journey as I don't want to have to take medication for the rest of my life. I am glad that I did and after struggling for 2 years, I am finally sugar free and now have a flat belly which was unthinkable previously.Do you know why sugar is so addictive ? It is because it is an energy booster and it works extremely fast. Taking even a little of it really picks you up and you feel you can tackle everything. It doesn't help when our brain is bombarded constantly with messages to take them. Think about the advertisements of the soda industry and even advertisements of the fast food industry invariable has a soft drink featured somewhere.How this reinforcement works to your detriment is this. You are having your meal and a advertisement pops up about a meal with a soft drink, your brain registers this and mentally you want a soft drink to go with your food. You ordered the soft drink and before long, you must have a soft drink at every meal. This cycle goes on until eventually, you want that soft drink even when you are not having a meal and you will have it at anytime the sugar effects wear off and you need the next sugar pick me up.Don't misunderstand me. I support going totally sugarless. I only caution taking a too simplistic approach because it will be counter-productive and may make your situation worse than before.I would suggest that before you do this challenge, do these first to prepare yourself for the challengeNow that you are mentally prepared yourself, take the item from the list that contributes the most sugar to cut from your diet, in my case it was the sodas. I would not suggest abstaining totally from all sugar all at once. In this instance, your objective is to first kick the biggest culprit out first, even though you may have to continue with the rest. In my case, when i decided to totally cut the sodas, I ended taking more coffee to offset the the drop of energy, albeit ones with lower sugar.Once you have successfully kicked the item with the most sugar off your food list, go for the next item, in my case, i cut back my coffee consumption to maximum 2 per day. Now, I only drink coffee black with no added sugar.Withdrawal symptons will surely hit hard and the chia fresca and guava are good substitutes to restore your energy, keep you hydrated and satiated so that you won't overeat, especially sugar laden food.Go slowly down the list until you have kicked every item off your list and you will be finally free from your sugar addiction.So now that you have the facts, go Do the No Sugar Challenge now", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/weight-loss/warning-do-the-no-sugar-challenge-at-your-own-risk.html"},

About that time I had received a newsletter from Sean Burns, search engine expert and the author of Rankings Revealed - How to Get Your Site to the Top of Search Engines. The information provided was just what I needed to get back on the first page of Google for the keyword phrase 'Beanie Babies.'I learned from Sean that there are basically two options to get a high rank on Google for your web site keyword phrases. Option #1Do free link exchanges with other web sites that have the same theme as your web site. You can target any keyword phrase you want to improve your rank with. This is important—the title text link you exchange with other web sites should be the keyword phrase you want to target. What I also like about the free link exchanges is that you can target one web page for many different keyword phrases. So once you get the rank you want for one keyword phrase then you choose another keyword phrase to target and use this new keyword phrase in the title text link that you now exchange with other web sites.It is also important to try and do all your free link exchanges with web sites that have a high Google Page Rank (PR). Go for link exchanges with sites with a PR3 or higher. Web sites with a higher Page Rank are viewed by Google as being more important and links to your web site from these high PR sites will help you more than doing link exchanges with a site with a PR1 or PR2.Here is a copy of the e-mail I send to other web site owners to request free link exchanges with.----------------------------------------------------------------Hi,I wanted to see if you'd do a free link exchange with me.Many of the top search engines use reciprocal linking to rank your web pages. In order to have high ranking web pages you need links back to your web site.Here is my information:Title: Beanie BabiesDescription: You'll find over 500 different styles of Beanie Babies at BarrysBeanies.com. Many at up to 59% off retail. We also wholesale Ty Beanie Babies.URL: http://www.BarrysBeanies.comPlease send e-mail to BarrysBeanies@aol.com after you place my link on your web site with the URL address of where it is located along with the information for your listing on my web site.Your information:Title:Description:URL:Once I receive your information I will place it on my Links Page and I'll e-mail the URL address where you'll be able to view your link.Thanks,Barry SteinBarrysBeanies.com----------------------------------------------------------------Option #2Optimize your web pages for keyword phrases. You'll want to target one keyword phrase per web page. If you have great content and have targeted a keyword phrase then eventually Google will index your web page and rank it higher.You should really use both these options, but of the two I like the free link exchanges best because I can quickly see theprogress I'm making. Do free link exchanges work? Well, as I stated above, my web site www.BarrysBeanies.comwas ranked number 33 for my most important keyword phrase, 'Beanie Babies.' I then started doing free link exchanges. Prior to that time I only had about 10 link exchanges on my web site with other web sites. Now I have about 100 links and my rank on Google for 'Beanie Babies' is number 5.So free link exchanges do work!Search engine ranking is one of the most important parts toyour overall Internet success if you have a web site.

He was falsely accused of rape and thus imprisoned, but God took care of him and rewarded him for his faithfulness and righteousness. In Joseph, we find a great model of sexual purity.Compared that to King David, who did not fare well in his battle with lust, as told in 2 Samuel 11, when he saw Bathsheba, the beautiful wife of Uriah the Hittite, bathing on a nearby roof. He allowed his sin of lust to turn into an active pursuit – the sin of adultery. This sin then led to another sin, which is the sin of murder. To cover up his sin of adultery, David had Uriah killed in battle. Thus, David did not only become an adulterer but also a murderer. Even though forgiven by God, he paid a horrible price for his sin.In an X-rated world where sex has been cheapened and evil things (such as pornography, sex gadgets, group sex, prostitution, same-sex relationships, and others as mentioned by author  in her book A Law From Eden), pervade society, what can you do to keep yourself pure in body and mind?", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/self-help/7-keys-to-maintaining-sexual-purity.html"},

Unfortunately, billions of people worldwide still lack this basic need. In 2017 only 71% of the global population or 5.3 billion people had access to safely managed drinking water services to bring clean water on premises that can be used whenever needed. The remaining 29% or 2.2 billion people had limited or no access to clean water. This includes people who collect water from unprotected wells, springs, lakes, rivers, and streams.Water that does not come from safely managed water services (like springs and streams) are at a high risk of contamination from: agricultural, industrial, and urban wastewater, that contain chemicals which might pollute these sources of water. Contaminated water is linked to many diseases such as cholera, diarrhea, polio, typhoid, and hepatitis A which cause death to many people especially to children. In addition, insects like mosquitos can live and breed in contaminated water sources which can transmit diseases such as dengue fever such as malaria.  Clean and safe water is important to be readily available to every person whether it’s for domestic use, food production, or drinking as it can highly affect society especially its public health. Now that we are facing the COVID-19 pandemic, the United Nations (UN) and World Health Organization (WHO) are making efforts to provide clean and safe water to communities to help prevent spread of the disease. The UN has partnered with national and local governments in building emergency safe drinking water and handwashing facilities in informal settlements and high-density public places. The WHO supports countries by advising governments on how to manage a contaminated water supply and providing water quality guidelines.Clean water should be accessible to everyone especially now that we are all at risk of a deadly disease which can easily be transmitted through droplets that cannot be seen by our naked eyes.

In the past some websites have been secretly hijacked with new info added to them without their knowledge.The reason can be for another website to track your users or to monitor what you’re doing to aide a competing business. Check your pages for any unusual content additions as well as any new plugins you didn’t add yourself.If you notice anything then you have a problem. Without backups of your website that problem can be very difficult to solve.Try this free malware and security scanner from Sucuri to see if you currently have a problem: https://sitecheck.sucuri.netWith backups you can fix things in a few clicks!Backing up your website could be something already in place without you even knowing it. Check with your webhost and see if you have automated backups already enabled and make sure you understand how to do a “roll back” where you can restore a previous version of your website that was backed up before you encountered an error.By doing this you can literally restore your website with a few clicks and save yourself a lot of stress.If you don’t have backups, see if your CMS (such as Wordpress) has a backup tool/plugin you can employ. There are many free options to choose from depending on how your website was built such as UpdraftPlus for Wordpress.If your website is 100% custom the easiest thing to do is to use a File Transfer Protocol tool such as Filezilla and manually download your website to your PC.

So it’s a really good idea to do periodic backups of your computer data.This process is easy and can become a routine habit once you’ve done it a few times.The first step will actually help with something mentioned in the website backup portion above and that’s to use Winzip or Winrar.These programs compress the files into one file so you have everything in one place. Some emails restrict sending these file types for security reasons so for these files you’re likely going to want to back up the data using a free cloud storage system like GDrive or Dropbox.After installing Winzip or Winrar you’ll be able to right click on the folder on your desktop with all your business info and simply select to add to archive. This will create the crunched copy of everything in that folder for easy storage.Then just head over to your preferred storage point and add the archive file! You can drag in onto an external drive or add it to a cloud. Either way you’ll have all that information available at your fingertips whenever you need it.Avoid Disaster and Implement!These might seem like trivial things to you or a big hassle to deal with… until you need them.Anyone who has experienced a hacked website or a compromised hard drive knows that hindsight is 20/20 and the words ‘if only I had…” suddenly become regrettably normal.Backups are like oil changes and should be done periodically to ensure your business keeps running without devastating interruptions.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/site-security/avoiding-disaster-make-website-and-business-asset-backups-mandatory.html"},

Some even argue that it is women’s biological role to nurture the family by providing warm home cooked meals on the table. The society seems to see women as the nurturing gender and expect them to cook more than men.In the 18th and 19th centuries, women’s role was confined to that of home-maker in which they stayed at home to take care of the house, children, and prepare meals while men went out to earn an income for the family. It was in the second half of the 20th century when women joined the work force which started to equalize the household chores between men and women.However, women still feel social pressure to be the primary care giver at home which includes providing nourishment to the family by cooking healthy and delicious meals. This causes many mothers to seek for part time job instead of full time so that they can take care of their kids and cook for the family. Mothers who do not conform in this way of parenting can face social stigma. On the other hand, although men are helping with household chores they do not feel this pressure to the same extent as women.Historically, and even up to today, women were the primary cook at home which makes it logical to assume that their dominance in the home kitchen would be reflected in professional kitchens like restaurants but the numbers suggest otherwise. In fact, professional kitchens are largely dominated by male chefs. For instance, in the US there is only 1 female executive chef to every 10 male executive chefs.There is a machismo atmosphere in the professional kitchen. This is probably because traditionally men were the ones who have careers and salaries. Women may be the primary cook at home but they were not doing it to earn a living unlike men. It was in the 1980’s and 1990’s when women began to make their name in the cooking industry. They have proven their capability and able to run restaurants as head chefs but this does not make a difference to gender inequality in the professional kitchens. Women are still not advancing to top positions in the culinary field as much as men.Women may not excel equally as men in professional kitchens but this does not mean that men are better cooks or more capable of being professional chefs than women.

It was originally created to help cure people of addiction to morphine. Upon crossing the blood-brain barrier, which occurs soon after introduction of the drug into the bloodstream, heroin is converted into morphine, which mimics the action of endorphins, creating a sense of well-being; the characteristic euphoria has been described as an “orgasm” centered in the gut. One of the most common methods of heroin use is via intravenous injection.Cocaine is a crystalline tropane alkaloid that is obtained from the leaves of the coca plant. It is both a stimulant of the central nervous system and an appetite suppressant, giving rise to what has been described as a euphoric sense of happiness and increased energy. It is most often used recreationally for this effect. Cocaine is a potent central nervous system stimulant. Its effects can last from 20 minutes to several hours, depending upon the dosage of cocaine taken, purity, and method of administration. The initial signs of stimulation are hyperactivity, restlessness, increased blood pressure, increased heart rate and euphoria. The euphoria is sometimes followed by feelings of discomfort and depression and a craving to experience the drug again. Sexual interest and pleasure can be amplified. Side effects can include twitching, paranoia, and impotence, which usually increases with frequent usage. Methamphetamime, popularly shortened to meth or ice, is a psychostimulant and sympathomimetic drug. Methamphetamine enters the brain and triggers a cascading release of norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin. Since it stimulates the mesolimbic reward pathway, causing euphoria and excitement, it is prone to abuse and addiction. Users may become obsessed or perform repetitive tasks such as cleaning, hand-washing, or assembling and disassembling objects. Withdrawal is characterized by excessive sleeping, eating and depression-like symptoms, often accompanied by anxiety and drug-craving.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/social-issues/top-drugs-and-their-effects.html"},

According to the manufacturing process, they are divided into 3 main categories.Functions of GeotextilesAs mentioned earlier, geotextiles are used to improve the soil characteristics before building embankments, pipelines, roads and earth-retaining structures. Let’s take a look at the main functions of geotextiles.SeparationThis is the main reason why geotextiles are used in civil construction projects. To prevent intermixing of two different soil when water gets into soil strata, geotextile is installed between them. This ensures that the soil characteristics are conserved. In the case of roads, separating the fine subgrade soil from the aggregates preserves the strength of base materials and drainage properties.One of the main functions of geotextiles is to prevent soil contamination and enable water flow without compromising the structural integrity. Some application areas are:FiltrationFiltration property is useful when there is a need for water to move in both directions in the drainage system. Filtration geotextiles can be woven or non-woven, and are used to prevent movement of fine aggregates between the soil layers.The 2 main properties involving filtration are porosity and permeability. Based on these properties, geotextiles can promote lateral flow of water for dissipating kinetic energy from capillary groundwater rise. Filtration applications can be both horizontal and vertical for solving drainage problems along roads and other structures.ReinforcementThe role of reinforcement is similar to the role of steels bars in . By implementing the design parameter provided by the geotechnical engineers, geotextiles are used for embankments and roads that are built on poorly graded soils.The soil strength in introduced in the following 3 mechanisms:SealingGeotextile fabrics can be filled with asphalt, which makes them impermeable and capable of stopping the vertical flow of water. For this, non-woven geotextiles are preferred. Impermeability can prevent the contamination of soil or groundwater from the pollutant above. This in turn, will help in preventing the loss of water due to evaporation.Applications of Geotextiles in Civil Engineering The scope of geotextiles in  is very vast. Below are some of the more common applications of Geotextiles:Roads – Used for reinforcing the additional tensile strength of soil for road construction. Also, can be used for rapid dewatering in the roadbed.Railways – Used for separating the individual soil layers without hampering the groundwater circulation where the ground is unstable. This is useful to keep the ground layers stable during constant shocks and vibrations from a passing train.Agriculture – Used for mud control to improve cattle paths by using non-woven fabrics.Coastal Work – Used for preventing erosion in river banks, canals and other water bodies.Some other applications are landfills, sidewalks, parking lots, green areas, duct banks, recreational facilities, etc. Geotextiles also have a positive environmental impact.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/social-issues/geotextiles-in-civil-construction-projects.html"},
{"heading": "Water Scarcity and COVID-19", "author": "Isabella Whitmore US", "description": "COVID-19 is a global pandemic that continues to cause hundreds of thousands of deaths, health threats, and economic issues. It instills fear in people and economic threats to governments as the disease is transmitted rapidly and kills thousands of people daily. Community lockdowns and quarantines has been implemented to control the spread of the disease, causing hunger in households and catastrophic effects to economies.", "word-count": 429, "body": "Frequent handwashing and social distancing are strongly advised by the World Health Organization (WHO) and governments to prevent the spread of the disease. However, these actions are difficult or impossible in some areas as they have limited access to clean water and handwashing facilities. For instance in Ghana and Kenya in Africa, where water scarcity remains a major problem, people struggle to comply with the advices as they likely to queue to access or buy water. Residents who spend hours each day waiting in crowded queues for access to water increase their risk of exposure to virus. The lack of water supply deprives people of the most basic protection needed against the life threatening COVID-19. Improving access to clean and safe water is a key factor in controlling and preventing the disease. It not only allows them to comply with the frequent handwashing advice but also lowers their vulnerability against the disease as they don’t necessarily have to go out and line up in a crowd to have access to water. Water is essential in controlling and preventing infectious diseases like COVID-19. Therefore, inadequate access to water makes it difficult to stop the transmission of the disease. Moreover, water is essential for hydration, sanitation, hygiene, and food production. Easy access to water will not only aid in the fight against the pandemic but will also resolve other community issues such waterborne illnesses like cholera and diarrhea that kill millions of people, cause hunger and dehydration, a lack of proper toilet facilities,  and poor sewage disposal. Access to water will even give economic benefits as people will have more time to work instead of spending hours to have access to water. Governments should work to provide sufficient water supply for people. Investing in easy access to water is necessary to promote proper hygiene and sanitation which not only protect communities against life threatening diseases but also builds resilience in the health and economic wellbeing of the whole community. In addition, access to water allows communities to have better protection from future pandemics. Improving water access is a great challenge especially now that we are facing climate change and droughts. Proper management of our natural water resources and water treatment should be done to ensure continued provision of essential water supplies to communities. However, providing easy access to clean and safe water is a big and long-term investment. As of now, government provides temporary but immediate solutions to the insufficient water supply problems of communities by placing water tanks and installing portable handwashing facilities to help control the spread of COVID-19.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/social-issues/water-scarcity-and-covid-19.html"},
{"heading": "The Difference Of Sexes", "author": "William West I Manuel", "description": "For time immemorial there has been a conflict between genders. Is there really a conflict or a genetic misunderstanding.", "word-count": 1518, "body": "Germaine Greer the Australian Feminist Writer stated that “After centuries of conditioning of the female into the condition of perpetual girlishness called femininity, we cannot remember what femaleness is. Though feminists have been arguing for years that there is a self-defining female energy, and a female libido that is not expressed merely in response to demands by the male, and a female way of being and of experiencing the world, we are still not close to understanding what it might be. Yet every mother who has held a girl child in her arms has known that she was different from a boy child and that she would approach the reality around her in a different way. She is a female, and she will die female.     Though many centuries should pass; archaeologists would identify her skeleton as the remains of a female creature.” Why is there a problem with sexes, and who gives value to male, and female? I say that men have glory in what they do in life, but women have glory in what they do also. There is conflict among the male, and female sex; even though neither are completely different. The differences of sexes are predominately biological rather than mostly environmental.     I will discuss the pros, and cons of this issue; also this article will explore great depths of studying the conflict of sexes between the male, and female of the human species. I chose this issue, because I have first-hand experience in the rhetoric of expressing conflict between sexes.     The research of the women health society by scientist like Larry Cahill, Ph.D., an associate professor in the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior at the University of California, Irvine. Through scientific research that the differences of sexes are biological from brain structure, and chemical function. The differences of the male, and female brains are beyond social interactions.     According to Deborah Blum a professor of journalism at the University of Wisconsin, she states that there are biological differences, and also cultural environmental influences. She states that men are more aggressive than women; therefore, every crime of 10 out of 15 robberies by men one was by a woman. She states that sex doesn’t matter at the early stages of pregnancy. Humans are unisex at the time of conception, but testosterone may create the difference. She states that children recognize they are a boy or girl between the ages of 2, and 3. The early differences of childhood shape the adults we become. Actually scientific research by the research professionals at the women health society found that the development of the brain in males, and females are different. Males decrease in grey brain matter which allows us to think, but increase in white matter this transfers information to different parts of the brain this is different with females. There are different affects, because of the estrogen, and testosterone on the brain.     According to Charley Reese a syndicated columnist stated that a male, and female differences are biological not environmental. Men have greater strength, and women have a greater capacity for endurance. Men are mentally better at math, and logic.  Women are better at verbal, and social skills. He states that the women movement or feminism is nonsense, and that this is causing mania in the United States. He states that feminists beat up on women for being a woman, and we are fighting nature while hurting ourselves. The characteristic of nature is profusion not uniformity, and we must adapt to reality. It will not be the other way around. Feminism should be done away with they are crackpot ideas. He states that real people do not need the ideas of the feminist; it causes people to be miserable, and have guilt trips. The feminist theories, and ideologies are cockamamie also ridiculous.     Genes play an important role in the differences of male, and female roles. There are male hormones, and also female hormones that help in developing what a male as well as a female become. Through research by the women health society this is absolutely not clear that women have better verbal skills than men. But while listening women use both sides of their brain, and men have one side activated. so women are better listeners. As far as processing spatial information males use both sides of their brain while females use one side. So yet again I say that the differences of sexes are more biological than environmental.     According to the researchers from Kings College London, and City University in London; they stated that boys prefer to play with trucks instead of dolls. The cause is family environment rather than genetic makeup. Genetic involvement plays a more major role in little girl’s choice of dolls over trucks. Also when twins share an environment it makes a major contribution to gender behavior roles. The scientific trials of the behaviors of children through the women research society has founded that male or female behavior effects are mediated directly by the brain, and indirectly through the social environment.      Ohle, Allison from the college UC Santa Cruz stated that gender is learned through a process of socialization, and through the culture of a particular society. Children learn between male, and female at birth; their behavior is perceived to determine them to be masculine or feminine. But each culture has variations with gender roles. As societies become more complex the roles of male as well as female are not just determined by culture, but by socio-political, and economic factors. Issues of gender differ from culture to culture. Many projects, and programs are designed to make women tasks easier. Every society uses biological sex to describe gender, but no culture will agree on what distinguishes one gender from another. Women roles are traditionally given no matter what culture. To determine gender; however, social and cultural perceptions of masculine or feminine traits, and roles must be taken into account. Now scientists have done research, and determined that gender relations are beyond social analysis as well as historical roots. The roles of women are contributed to them naturally thus common from culture to culture. But women development is negatively affected than men tend to be in gender roles.     The differences of the sexes are predominately biological as major studies have come to this conclusion. The differences of sexes are a world conflict between male, and female about who is superior to the other. The female cell is older than the male. The male chromosome is xy, but that y is a mutation of the female X chromosome. The X chromosome is the genetic design of the female, but the male is a hybrid of the female. The male body has what the female body has except the penis is longer than the female penis called the clitoris. This difference is the female hormone estrogen, and the male hormone testosterone. The estrogen levels in men are lower, and the testosterone levels are higher. Men use the differences of sex as an excuse to rule over women, but they are supposed to protect them.     I’m proud to be a man, but I also give praise to the mother; the women are connected to mother Earth. The male role in life is to protect his family, populate the planet, and make peace in the world.     In Deborah Tannen’s essay,” Cross Talk” she states that, “Women are in a double bind: If we talk like women, we are not respected. If we talk like men we are not liked.” (Tannen 393)     In conclusion, there are many views of how gender roles of male, and female are developed. But science has proven that the difference of the sexes is predominately biological, and not environmental. But the bottom line is that God made male design to do exactly what they are naturally able to do. The female are also made to do exactly what they are able to do; in the eyes of God male, and female are equal. We are all God’s children. God existed before sexes or gender. So why are we as a human family continually having a conflict about sexes. When we are born there is no meaning of gender to a child; the conflict is learned throughout the child’s life. So in order to change the conflict; we would have to change ourselves first.     In the words of Michael Jackson, “change the man or woman in the mirror.”Germaine, Greer. “Gender.” Book of Famous Quotes: .

Our DNA generate our unique design. Identify your indentity!", "word-count": 692, "body": "The dictionary states that identity is the set of characteristics that somebody recognizes asbelonging uniquely to himself or herself, and constituting his or her individual personality forlife. To me it also means information that is used to show what a person is. There are threeclassifications that characterize some people’s identities: race, gender, and religion.Race is what makes a person who they are down to the very bones of the body. Manypeople don’t know their nationality, and hate their race. I’m a Kemetian American Moor of the Igbo tribe, but many African Americans don’t like their creed. What they don’t know is life started in Africa! Blacks are indigenous to the planet Earth according to the National Geographic, and many archeologists. The other races came later from biological genetic mutations in the DNA of black Africans who migrated to cooler areas. Racism exists, because people who are alike don’t get along. Humans are all somewhat genetically connected; scientifically opposites attract, and things that are alike repel. Magnetically this is the rule of attraction. The human body has a magnetic North, and South Pole just like the planet Earth. Race is very important to me in a positive way not like the woman in the essay “Hypocrisy” who used race as a way to hurt people.This discrimination is still practiced to this very day.Gender is a world conflict between male, and female about who is superior to the other.The female cell is older than the male. The male chromosome is xy, but that y is a mutation ofthe female X chromosome. The X chromosome is the genetic design of the female, but the male is a hybrid of the female. The male body has what the female body has except the penis is longer than the female penis called the clitoris. This difference is also, because of the female hormone estrogen, and the male hormone testosterone. The estrogen levels in men are lower, and the testosterone levels are higher. Men use gender as an excuse to rule over women, but they are supposed to protect them. I’m proud to be a man but I also give praise to the mother; the women are connected to mother Earth. The male role in life is to protect his family, populate the planet, and make peace in the world.Religion is a tool used to connect oneself to a higher power. The Martin Luther conflictstarted with the Anglican Church of England, which was Catholic. Denominations of differentfaiths started with Martin Luther a priest of the Catholic Church, but he had a conflict of what the church preached. He believed that the Bible was the superior holy recording, and the men had a direct connection to God. Religion is what fuels war because of conflict of interest. I myself believe that all religions stem from one source Egypt, but the words of men, our language, make war or conflict. The highest universal creator is ruler no matter what religion. I was raised at the beginning as a Hebrew Israelite; my main studies started out to be Bible related. We practiced all the Old Testament’s traditions, and laws that were required in the Israelite faith. As time progressed we began to learn more in detail about Biblical doctrine by translating from the original language that the Bible was recorded in. I have studied all three of the monotheistic religions, which helped me understand why the information was hidden from the average person. I progressed further, and began to educate myself in the higher mysteries, which lead me tomysteries of God. By my experience, and education. I learned the value of my race, gender, and religion. These great identities should bring grace, and importance to men and women. Instead they bring wars, indifference, and hate. I promise myself to teach my son the importance of these identities, and I hope the world will be a better place to live in when he becomes an adult. No matter what the agony, pain, or embarrassment. I fight to be what I’am today: a better man. The children are the future, and we are the developers of the present.

{"heading": "Cultural Indifference Literary Analysis of the Graphic Novel American Born Chinese", "author": "William West I Manuel", "description": "We as a planetary family are suffering from cultural indifference. We all inhabit this planet as a whole. We can coinhabit peacefully.", "word-count": 2167, "body": "Chinese are Mongolian people that live in Asia. The country that the Chinese people inhabit is China. China has over 2 billion people living in its borders and many Chinese are relocating to the United States to live because of the overcrowding issues of China. This novel is based on this relocation of Chinese men or women, and children to the United States. This novel also focuses on spiritual practices of the Chinese, and lessons of everyday living. This novel focuses on many experiences of indifference; also how people, as well as different species are treated, because of indifference. I will analyze this novel using the theory of cultural studies; and will prove that cultural literature affects every day living.       What is culture? According to the Webster’s dictionary it means “The beliefs, customs, and arts of a particular group, society, place or time.” The Chinese have a rich culture, and their culture is different in many ways comparison to the American way of life. For example in the novel the boy called Jin spoke of a statement that his mother had told him about their culture he said,” My mother once explained to me why she chose to marry my father. Of all the Ph.D. students at the university, he had the thickest glasses. The thick glasses meant long hours of studying. Long hours of studying meant a strong work ethic. A strong work ethic meant a high salary. A high salary meant a good husband.”       We in America mostly marry for love not high salary. Many Americans treat Chinese immigrants badly, because of their culture; so therefore, the Chinese that relocate to America try to introduce some of their culture by starting businesses, and starting teaching careers as well as martial art schools. But a child growing up in the American environment that treats them unfairly, because of indifference is very dramatic.       According to Publisher’s Weekly,” The book American Born Chinese is a fable for every kid born into a body, and a life they wished they could escape.”        At the early stage of child development the brain function is in heavy activity. This is the time a child starts to read. The child reads often as well as learn from what is read, and applies this to his or her life.       According to Live Science the amount of mentally stimulating materials around the home such as the number of books that are in the home may predict the structure of the brain later in life.        According to researcher Brian Avant an associate professor of radiology at the University of Pennsylvania the time a child spends at home with their parents before they reach the age to attend school will affect the child for the rest of their lives.       So a child learns the bad behavior of treating people unfairly, because of indifference at an early age by the actions of their parents. These are some examples of children in school treating other children unfairly, because of indifference in this novel. These are the following: The child Jin Wang is being introduced to the class by the teacher, and one of the male students says,” My momma says Chinese people eat dogs.” Another incident in the book is a guard at the entrance to a party says to a king,” You may be a king, you may even be a deity, but you are still a monkey. Have a good day sir.”        According to Gill Grozer who wrote the book “Youth in Education: The Necessity of Valuing Ethno-cultural Diversity” he states that a predominately all white school will cause a child of a different race, and culture to experience indifference on an everyday basis.        So the environment that we surround our children with cause some of the bad experiences that the child lives with every day until these acts of indifference is remedied. The parents have to acknowledge the child circumstances at school in order to remedy the problem.        Mike Cadden is a professor of English, and director of childhood studies at Missouri Western State University. Mike teaches children literature. He wrote an article in 2014 writing criticism about the graphic novel 'American Born Chinese'. He states that Ramón Saldívar says that this novel is speculative realism. The author is trying to express revisions of realism and fantasy into speculative forms that intend to shape new narrative modes in contemporary fiction. Cadden states “That American Born Chinese graphic novel is an experiment in discussing minority racial identity through metaphor made possible through genre blending.” He states” That this novel intentional transformation for change is never a real option. It is a self- delusion.”       A critic by the name of Jonathan Doughty says,” That the novel reminds us of a paradox. Is identity one’s possession or one’s possessor? How do we possess are identities, and how do they possess us.” Mr. Cadden concludes by saying,” Yang’s book provides a vague sense of resolution for which the reader is simultaneously grateful, and unsure about how it actually works as a resolution. It does not bear up to scrutiny. While the narrative implies that racial denial is simply unacceptable, and makes a case to move forward. It does not show us what moving forward looks like.”       Philip Smith of Lough Borough University writes a paper that critiques this graphic novel. He states, “That the character of the novel called Chan-Kee is a monstrously exaggerated concatenation of every popular cultural stereo-type of Asian, and Asian Americans over the last two centuries.” (Gardner, 2010, 139) Smith expresses the use of Asians in comics to inform the world about the Asian culture has been going on for the last two centuries. But the comics introduced always show the Asians in a bad light or bad persona.The book American Born Chinese is just one of the books that display the Asian people in a negative way. Smith concludes by saying,” That Yang offers a postmodern critique of Asian, and Asian American stereotypes. He involves the reader with subtle forms of racism at work in the American society. He challenges concepts of monolithic Asian culture, and invites readers to consider the various cultural forces which create, and proliferate stereotypes. In doing so, he joins with other voices working in American comics which seek to reinvent Asian American identities in American media.”       The most likely reader of this type of children literature is children from the age of 6 up to the young adult readers. Many of the children that read this book will think that it is funny to treat Chinese unfairly. The Chinese children that read this book will feel violated, and not welcomed in the American society. In the book the character Chin-Kee is the ultimate negative stereotype of Asians. In the story he is viewed as someone that eat cats, spit, is loud, and out spoken. He cannot speak English well, and he wears non-American attire. For a Chinese child to view this character in this book would be disastrous to his or her mentality. Yang’s idea of teaching racial identity for Asians through this book failed the Asian culture, because it’s more negative aspects of the story than it is positive. 'It's easy to become anything you wish... so long as you are willing to forfeit your soul.' (Gene Yang, American Born Chinese)Many Chinese come to American, and does just that sell their soul. This is done by giving up their Chinese culture and adapt to the American culture. They wear American clothes, learn English, and eat American foods. They become Americanized, but children chose this way in order to fit in with their peers. School children can be very troublesome, and harsh to others outside of their culture as well as race.       Jin Wang dislikes himself so much he transforms himself into a white boy. He feels that is the only way he will be accepted. He evens disassociates his self from anything Chinese; therefore, his cousin Chin-Kee that comes to visit him every year is a thorn in Jim Wang’s foot. Jim Wang changes his name to Danny, and does not accept Chin-Kee as his cousin.       According to James Baumann of the University of Georgia the cognitive structure created when a child reads a story, and comprehends it is called story schema. The test that the first graders was involved in resulted in an interactive intervention by using story mapping was effective immediately than enhancing students comprehension of story elements. ( Baumann)       So Baumann concludes by saying his research has proved that children literature can affect a child in the later years if the child can comprehend the book, and if not the teacher has to explain the book to the child by instruction layering.       The monkey king’s story in the book adds some fantasy to the book. This addition draws the reader attraction to the book so that the reader will want to read further into the story. The Monkey King is a story about a monkey born from a rock that considers his self to be a god as well as a king. He rules a place called Flower Fruit Mountain, and has many subjects or monkeys that serve him. He wants to be accepted in heaven by the gods, and so he travels by cloud to heaven for a party. The monkey king is not accepted, because even though he is a god king he still is a monkey. He gets violent, and thrown out of heaven. The monkey king is very arrogant, and feels if he becomes more powerful in Kung Fu he can overcome the incident in heaven, and be accepted as a god king. He thinks this will allow him to visit the heaven to dwell among the gods. But there is a decree from heaven that the monkey king must die. The monkey by pass this decree by using his Kung Fu, and eventually has to be tested by god in order to become an emissary.      This portion of the book gives the reader the chance to begin his or her development of imagination. Imagination for a child usually starts at the age of seven. So children literature does affect children in everyday life, but adults it does not because adult’s brains have already fully developed by the age of adulthood. Children literature helps grow the child’s brain, and stimulate brain activity. So more books that are positive needs to be written for children; therefore, the graphic novel The American Born Chinese is not a good choice for early child hood readers. This book has to many negative aspects that a child would consider accurate cultural Asian behavior, customs, and beliefs.       In conclusion all books can be used in a positive way, but there should be only certain books allowed to be read by early child hood readers. The brain of an early child hood reader is delicate, and too many negative ideas can cause the child to express his or her self in bad behavior as the child grows up in a diverse society. Yang’s idea of introducing Asian culture in an American format should have been more about the good things that America offers Chinese. Being that the book called American Born Chinese is for children it has the wrong target market, and should have a target for older teens that have already learned the right from wrong, and can determine how to treat other racial groups that have different cultures. More importantly the child should be focusing on fun facts, and not adult ideologies about racial identities as well as other cultures that are expressed in a negative way.We all have to live in a world of indifference, but the children should not have to be a part of that world until they are ready mentally. If only mankind can accept what is different, and move pass petty inconstancies. The children can have a better future, and can change the world we live in.        Acknowledge the youth before writing a National Book Award Finalist like the American Born Chinese. Children literature does affect our children in their lives and beyond; therefore, we have to inform authors like Gene Yang to tone it down for are early readers.   Baumann, James.

The author has discussed the change of north Korean migrants into Christianity. Two different migrant activities have been discussed which include, leaflet campaigns and music concerts. It details the performance rituals of peace and violence which explain the religious and political steps taken in terms of the cold war of Seoul.The religious-political is discussed that took place in Seoul. The rivalry of Pyongyang and Seoul is discussed, the nature of both cities towards their religious and political beliefs are also taken into consideration. The impact of their religion due to this approach. This rivalry not only has swayed the physical developments of the cities, but also the ideology of both the cities. Where both cities are considered to be the best, in terms of armed forces, each of the cities has been hyper in controlling the lack of ideology, opinions, and political influences. Pyongyang was considered as the “Jerusalem of Asia” by the American school of thought. But, now it has been to the Juche ideology. While, Seoul is known for its idol worship thoughts, in the present day.More Read: The study also focuses on the spiritual beliefs, each of the city follows. In the past years, Seoul has stuck itself in the military rise and ideological issues in society. The North has defended its anti-communist approach and declined any thoughts to come from the south. The south is more concerned about any bombing from the North, instead of any shopping malls being closed. However, this mismatch of the national defense, the high protestant churches have made rituals to protect their salvation against any communist activities. The north migrants have also converted themselves, and become the leaders to protect their warfare, in terms of human rights and of national beliefs.In the study, the author tells about a migrant who converts and is known as David. He is as old as fifty years, who has been a leader in controversial ritual activities in North Korea. He left his home from the west and came to the North, to carry out missionary activities. He used to send ballons, containing leaflets and items, on to the Korean border. David was a scientist, but now he is known for the Christian activities he performs. Unlike other migrants, he fled to the South in the search of finding the truth. But, there he found a leaflet, near the northern border, from which he was involved in the Juche ideology.More Read: These leaflets might be one of the propaganda, made by South Korean intelligence to make psychological warfare. These drills have been in process for decades when the ceasefire between north and south was already in progress. The balloon leaflets often contained images of naked women, which was believed to be disturbing, by the intelligence agents in the north.However, the author in this study analyzed deeply about the differences the south and north of any region can have, and how it impacts the vast majority of the society. A belief of one individual can have a huge impact. Practices did by the north and south Korean regions, tend to have developed different ideologies and make assumptions about the other side. With-U and leaflet campaigns described in detail can also tell about the war amongst the two sides, which was developed in the name of religious and political affairs.ReferencesJung, J. H. (2016).

{"heading": "Fatherhood- A Life Long Responsibility", "author": "William West I Manuel", "description": "A father's duty is to groom, protect, and provide for his family. Many men fail in those duties. Be more than a gender. Be a father!", "word-count": 721, "body": "According to the dictionary, a father is a man who is a parent of a human being, but to me a father is supposed to be a guardian who protects, cares, and provides for a child. There are three things children are supposed to receive from a father: to be taught about a man’s divine purpose, to be taught how to become a protector, and to be taught how to survive in the world.According to God’s principle of life, the beginning of a father’s duties starts as soon as the egg is fertilized by the sperm. As the child grows there should be lessons taught on how to behave correctly, eat properly, dress appropriately, and to begin to know right from wrong. To be moral a child must learn by example; this would allow a child to make the right decisions. Children may instinctively know right from wrong, but the parents must teach the child further. If learning how to make right decisions is not taught, then the child won’t know how to make proper decisions. For example, in the Adam, and Eve story; they didn’t know right from wrong until they were kicked out of the garden. This must be taught by example, but my father only showed me the wrong things to do. I learned to do right or wrong by reading the Bible stories, and by wanting to do the opposite of what my father did. To combine values, and morals makes children ethically sound. It’s easy to do the wrong things; however, it's hard to do the right thing, but people have to choose. For instance, my father made me paint the entire house. When I complained he took out a loan in my name for $100.00, and then said I had to pay it back. Also like the poem “My Papa’s Waltz,” one day my father came home drunk. He started smacking us around, and poured beer all over my stepmom.A father is also responsible to provide for his family; this is his Godly purpose. It’s a father’s duty to respond to his family’s needs. My father did this very well; I did not have to worry about food, shelter, or clothing. He was a carpenter. He also worked as a dish washer, managed properties, and did side jobs. A father also must provide the child with guidance; to be guided properly by a father is to be taught the family trade. This is what I practiced for 16 years. I chose not to pursue it further, but I did have the skills to do basic residential building maintenance. My father did not teach me about the skills of surviving the world; I learned when I was on my own. I ran away when I was 16. I learned how to survive, because I had no choice. It was a time that I was hungry, and I had no food nor a job. I did not have the guidance to handle this situation; so I had to adapt. I had to use my animal instincts to search, find, ask, and not be ungrateful or picky about what I received.Presently, because of my experiences; I’m a better father than my father. I took his wrong examples, and changed them into right ones. I also became affiliated with the world of Freemasonry where a man’s character is molded into a well-mannered Godly man. People are only what the environment makes them, and what the society shapes them. The child sees the father as a protector. If the father fails to do so; the child begins to reject the father. I began to reject my father at the age of nine. He did nothing I expected of him except give me a home to live in, and the beginnings of a trade. He gave me no love. If a father does not give or show love; then the father will not receive any in return when the child becomes an adult. I’m a self- made man, and father with no regrets. I’m disappointed in my father whom I do not consider my father anymore. I learned I shouldn’t hate people no matter what they have done to me; I know I should just let them go or erase them out of my life in order to get some peace.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/social-issues/fatherhood-a-life-long-responsibility.html"},

From routine work to business operations, anything could be affected due to unexpected fluctuation in voltage supply. This is why more and more people are turning to a transformer manufacturer in India to get a stable solution to their problems. If you are one of them, you might want to know everything about the transformer, its uses, and types. Well, this guide is meant for you.What is a Transformer?A transformer is an electrical device that is applied to control the voltage supply between two circuits. It can increase or decrease the voltage levels between two circuits. The process of increasing the voltage level is called Step Up and that of decreasing the voltage level is called Step Down.How transformers are important in the electrical system?Before we go ahead to understand how a transformer works, let first look at its structure. A transformer is made by two coils wound around an iron core. These two coils are not connected. The coil that receives A.C. input is called the Primary Coil and the one that gives the A.C. output is called Secondary Coil.The transformer works on the concept of mutual induction. It is a very important part of electrical circuits used in transmitting electric energy to long distances. Transformers help in modifying the Voltage and current ratio to keep the power constant and also help in minimizing the loss of power in long-distance transmissions.While transmitting electrical energy to long distances it is found that energy loss is minimum when it is transmitted with high voltage. So, a Step-up transformer is used. This transformer has a power supply from the power station as input. And output generated by this transformer has a very high voltage as required for long-distance transmission. Therefore, the electrical utilities such as wires, used in long-distance transmission, are built to withstand the high voltage. However, such a high voltage is not safe for domestic use and domestic electrical appliances. So, it is required to lower down the voltage just before it reaches our houses. So here comes the use of a step-down transformer. This transformer converts high voltage input to a much lower voltage output that is safe for domestic use and suitable for domestic appliances. So, this is how transformers help in transmitting power too long distances with minimum energy loss.Power station -&gt; Step up transformer (to increase the output voltage) -&gt; Step-down transformer (to decrease the output voltage) -&gt; Domestic supplyHave a Glance at Different Types of TransformersThere are majorly five types of transformers based on their usage.ConclusionTransformers play a very important role in enhancing efficiency and safety. So, if you are looking for  you should look for the trusted manufacturers that offer good quality transformers.

At the point when it works, it's unfathomably quick – we effortlessly oversaw 200Mpbs in a hurry – however, there are still such a large number of spots, even in huge urban communities, where it's difficult to get full inclusion.All things considered, given that many are clutching their telephones for three or four years these days, this is an element that will just turn out to be more helpful after some time – the iPhone 12 can interface with a gigantic scope of 5G frequencies as well, implying that if there's a 5G sign where you will be you should have the option to associate with it.The new (to iPhones) MagSafe connector on the back of the iPhone 12 is a truly fascinating recommendation – this attractive association tech not just empowers you to join things to your telephone, for example, a charger or a case, however, can likewise determine what's been associated through an extraordinary chip.MagSafe empowers quicker and more exact charging and carries with it another scope of adornments (like a wallet cut on) at the same time, similarly as 5G will turn out to be more helpful over the long run, we're pretty sure that the MagSafe extra reach will improve greatly as outsider makers get their hands on the innovation.That implies we could see some cool clasp on adornments like games regulators, photograph printers and gigantic additional batteries not far off.The presentation of the iPhone 12 has been overhauled indeed: the A14 Bionic chipset is the most remarkable in any cell phone, and the benchmarks bear that out as it obliterates the opposition - and unusually, doesn't get beaten by the hypothetically more impressive iPhone 12 Pro.The choice to begin with 64GB inside is miserly, however, and you may begin knocking into that boundary not long from now in the event that you like taking photographs and recordings at full goal.The iPhone 12 plan has been changed, with made right edges that are exceptionally suggestive of the iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 from days gone by, and another Ceramic Shield front that is clearly multiple times harder to break than the iPhone 11 (not that we were happy to drop-test our initial survey test).The presentation has been redesigned as well: it's currently an OLED screen, the very tech that is utilized on the iPhone 12 Pro and offers rich tones and profound blacks, just as bringing genuine HDR to the blend for viable substance. It seems like something little, yet maybe the smooth 120Hz presentation tech would have been a help here as well; be that as it may, you are as yet getting a sharp and bright review insight on the iPhone 12.Cameras-wise, you're again getting the 12MP couple of the wide and super-wide cameras here.

One is little while the other is tremendous, however, I figure the small might be great.", "word-count": 612, "body": "To recap: there are presently five 2020 iPhone decisions with various value focuses. There's the iPhone SE ($399 for 64GB); the 12 small scale ($699 for 64GB); the 12 ($799 for 64GB); the 12 Pro ($999 for 128GB) and the 12 Pro Max ($1099 for 128GB.) The iPhone 11 is additionally as yet staying nearby, at $599 for 64GB, just like the iPhone XR, which I don't prescribe to anybody. That is a great deal of finely reviewed iPhone decisions.iPhone 12 Mini: Petite Power I've been hanging tight for the iPhone 12 smaller than usual for quite a long time, it seems like.Telephones are too large. They are harming our minds, our pockets, and our general public by turning out to be monster vortexes that suck up the entirety within recent memory and consideration. It's deteriorated in 2020, the Corona Year. The previous evening, I sat on the sofa for two hours, enigmatically doom scrolling on my goliath telephone.A more modest telephone addresses a daily existence that exists outside your telephone, and it's the sort of life we need. More modest telephones are intended to be utilized in one hand while you're clutching a kid or a pack with the other hand — you know, strolling outside, not crouched under the covers with a major gleaming screen attempting to fight off the world.There aren't some high-caliber, more modest telephone decisions. The iPhone SE, which is a similar size as the more seasoned iPhone 6, has truly been the leader there. (There's likewise the Unihertz Jelly 2 and Palm telephones, which are much smaller, yet they don't have premium processors and highlights.)At 5.18 by 2.53 by 0.29 inches and 4.76 ounces, the  is significantly more modest than the iPhone SE. Its hard-edged body feels new and present-day, not produced using reused parts. Indeed, there's a tad of the iPhone 4 (and along these lines the first SE) in the sharp right point of its edges, yet the unibody structure is far smoother and more amazing than it was in the iPhone 4 time.The 5.4-inch, 2,340-by-1,080 screen has an incredibly close 477ppi pitch, making text little yet a lot more honed than on the iPhone SE's 4.7-inch, 326ppi screen. This telephone isn't for individuals with tired eyes who need enormous sort; it's for individuals who are all over town, who have different activities than gaze at their telephones. Without the SE's goliath top and base bezels, it has fundamentally more screen land than the SE (or the iPhone 8, 7, or 6) did. On the NYTimes.com site, for example, that are three additional lines of a little kind feature.As per Apple, it additionally has the entirety of the highlights found on the —similar radio groups, similar cameras, a similar rapid A14 processor. It's simple, you know, more modest and $100 more affordable. I'll need to check those highlights, obviously.Early surveys of the scaled-down are out as of now, so I'm not imagining the wheel here. Battery life has all the earmarks of being the top worry in a large number of those audits. I did one short-term video web-based test, and the scaled-down got more than 10 hours — like the iPhone 12 and far superior than I jumped on the iPhone SE. The grievances seem to come from more blended-use situations, so I'll watch out for that.My pandemic cerebrum is letting me know: sink once more into the lounge chair. Try not to head outside. Get sucked in by a big screen. What do you need a free hand for, in any case? Be that as it may, with the current week's immunization news, perhaps it's an ideal opportunity to hope against hope.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/technology/big-or-small-hands-on-with-the-iphone-12-mini.html"},

Then I am sorry to say this, but you probably haven’t understood the complete concept. If you truly want to make money at something, you must also understand it completely.", "word-count": 932, "body": "If the main source of your crypto knowledge is the news or just casual conversations with your friends. Then I am sorry to say this, but you probably haven’t understood the complete concept. If you truly want to make money at something, you must also understand it completely.These days cryptocurrency has a lot of hype. Since it has solely created many millionaires in the last decade. Today, I will tell you 7 things you need to know, before you begin your crypto journey. You should also check out the beast hardware wallet in the market.The basicsThe first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is a type of digital currency invented by an anonymous creator using the Satoshi Nakamoto pseudonym in 2009. A bank or public agency does not manage Cryptos. Cryptocurrency token transactions are instead registered on a public blockchain, consisting of digital information stored on a database. Their future remains doubtful. Michael Anderson, co-founder of Framework Projects, says, 'Tokens or coins used in a decentralised network are not the same as shares in a business.'Digital currency is risky businessIt is very speculative to invest in crypto-currencies. Many crypto assets would fail, like the majority of start-up businesses, and therefore become useless. Beginners that are investing should only invest an amount they don’t mind losing. Investing at an inopportune moment, amid reports of investors making millions, will result in rapid and serious losses. One unit of bitcoin (BTC) sold for approximately $1,500 as late as May 2017. Bitcoin went as high as $19,800 at its peak in December 2017. BTC has recently ranged in price from $6,600 on 15 April to $10,000 on 7 May. Although it is tempting to hit it rich by investing in cryptos, this market is highly risky and there is a real risk of major losses.There are many uses for cryptoCryptocurrency is known for the funding some questionable deals. And yet legal businesses are now accepting crypto payments. Cryptos offer fast, low-cost money transfers. This makes it prevalent to use them for transfers of foreign currency. In fact it took only two and a half minutes for a $99 million Litecoin (LTC) transaction to cost the sender less than one dollar in transaction fees. Cryptos are free from the government and can't be frozen. That's because only a person with a private key to the wallet has access to the asset. Investors can also speculate when listing cryptocurrencies, betting on which ones will succeed and which ones will fail.Investors have many strategiesOne solution to cryptocurrency investments is easy speculation. Yet there are unique strategies for crypto-currency investors, much like investing in the stock market. Marcus Swanepoel, CEO of Luno, a global cryptocurrency firm, says with fundamental and technical research, you can day-trade cryptos, buy and hold and analyse the money. Despite the difficulty of forecasting digital currency lows and highs, Swanepoel claims there are market analysis methods that can inform investors when to buy and sell. Cryptocurrency assessment techniques include principles such as asset availability, demand, and future applications. For example, the supply of bitcoin is set at 21 million units, meaning that because of the fixed supply, demand will boost prices.The IRS does not recognize crypto as currencyCryptocurrency is considered property by the Internal Revenue Service in the U.S. Cryptocurrency investments is also subject to the tax laws regulating investment in land. 'This ruling imposes extensive record-keeping requirements, and with steep penalties, the IRS makes tax enforcement of cryptocurrencies a high priority,' says Robert Elwood, partner at Practus, a law firm in Philadelphia. 'Only when the record-keeping burden is worthwhile should transactions be carried out in taxable accounts.' If enacted, the 2020 Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act could encourage more use of cryptocurrencies because taxes would only be implemented on digital currency if a transaction's profit is greater than $200. This will allow people to pay with digital currency for smaller transactions easily. That said, like all assets owned within these accounts, cryptos kept in retirement accounts are shielded from tax.Many crypto coins are likely to failAs for any market, the cryptocurrency's future is not assured. 'I believe that in a few years, cryptocurrencies will implode and no longer exist in any meaningful sense, and that the entire market for cryptocurrencies is a bubble,' says Robert R. Johnson, Creighton University's professor of finance. Johnson argues that the 'greater fool theory' drives the cryptocurrency market, as investors rely on new buyers to bid up the price. If Johnson is incorrect and the demand for crypto-currencies does not crash, the issue of whether digital currencies can survive remains. Not all will last with thousands of entrants in the industry and new offerings emerging. The most well-known brands, such as bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin, should probably stick to investors who want to speculate in this market. Before investing, it is also wise to learn a bit about the market for each person.You can lose all your cryptoIt is probable for an account balance to be wiped out since cryptocurrencies are virtual and lack a central storehouse. For example, a crash of a computer without a backup might kill a crypto-currency stash. The cryptocurrency they hold is unrecoverable if a user loses the private key to their wallet. By impersonating an account holder, scammers may even hijack someone's mobile account. Thieves contact the carrier and order the transfer of the user's SIM card to a new device. This gives cryptocurrency accounts access to scammers. Investors are responsible for keeping track of their private key and using the . Professionals also recommend that you back up and use secure passwords for your cryptocurrency private keys.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/technology/7-things-to-know-before-becoming-a-cryptocurrency-trader-or-user.html"},

{"heading": "Cricket fielding or baseball fielding which one is harder?", "author": "adamwiliams", "description": "is often referred to as fielding in baseball or football. Fielding at the game of cricket is just the action of fielding the ball, after which the player collects the ball or to stop the ball hitting the bat, after it has been hit by the other team's batsman. There are a few different cricket fielding positions, depending on which type of cricket you are playing. However, one common position is known as the off stump.", "word-count": 674, "body": "The off stump position is a common position for bowlers who are out on the boundary line. These players normally have a good batting stance, but are not in their best form, and as such may be out of form batsmen, or have had bad shots. For example, an off stump batsman is out on the boundary because he has had a couple of poor shots, but is at least still in good form. Bowling from the off  is another way to bat in cricket. You are allowed to bowl if you are out on the boundary. However, this will cause the fielding side to have a difficult time catching up. This is because the off stump position, as well as the batting position, have the team batting third, with the outfield players in front of the stumps as in other cricket playing positions. The batting position can be changed at any time when you are out on the boundary line. This means that if you are out of form, you can switch from off stump to batting in the other batting position. There are many different cricket batting positions, depending on how the other batting side is batting. For example, if you have the other team batting first, then batting at the other end of the field is often a safer position, where you are not in front of your stumps, but behind the wicketkeeper. However, there are some cases where you may be required to bat in front of your stumps, especially if the other batting team is batting with a fast bowler, who may put you under pressure. Batting is a simple position in cricket. You simply stand at the same point of the ground that you would in most positions. You may need a support runner to help you reach the other end of the field if you are not in your best form, though. Batting is usually played in the middle of the field, though this depends on the batting order. The off stump batsmen are typically the lowest-ranked batsmen, the middle-order batsmen are the highest batsmen and the top batsmen are the highest-ranking batsmen. They are the most important batsmen, in terms of scoring runs and batting numbers. Batting positions are important in cricket and the importance of the batting positions is more important than it used to be in earlier days when bowlers were required to bat in front of their stumps. When bowlers were required to bat out at the other end of the ground they had to take a risk, and when they were out at the other end of the ground they had to bat on the boundary, leaving them with no option but to hit the stumps. It has become easier for batsmen to bat in front of the stumps now. This has led to many more bowlers being able to bat in front of the stumps, which has increased the importance of batting positions. Bowling is a little bit different than batting since the bowlers are not required to bat out at the other end of the ground. There are two ways to position a bowler on the boundary line - bowling across the field of play or bowling to the boundary line. In bowling across the field of play, the bowler must know the location of the wicketkeeper and the bowling balls and must make sure that he has it covered while bowling. Bowling to the boundary line requires that the bowler has good control over the ball while bowling across the field of play. Bowling to the wicketkeeper's end of the field requires that the bowler knows the location of both the wicketkeeper and the batsman and must make sure that he has covered all these two people. While bowling on the boundary line, it is not necessary to have complete control over the ball while bowling. Catching is important in cricket, as well as bowling. This is why some cricket players spend many hours working on their fielding skills.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/sports/cricket-fielding-or-baseball-fielding-which-one-is-harder.html"},

{"heading": "Strategy Advice for NBA Prop Betting", "author": "Bruce Markey", "description": "Before placing any prop betting, check out the different bookmaker’s prices and lines as sometimes they keep on fluctuating a lot. You may get a better line at a good price somewhere else.", "word-count": 489, "body": "Most Australian and US betting websites provide different NBA betting markets for every game. One of the most interesting and sometimes lucrative is the basketball players' performance betting markets. Apart from the game's superstars, most of the player's statistics fluctuate a significant amount every night. So, if you can determine when it is or isn't going to be a player's night, you can take advantage of the player's performance in the NBA prop markets. Here are a few tips for making your own decision regarding prop betting on player performance markets. In general, a few selected players are given an under/over on a different statistic, whether it be rebounds, points, assists, or a combination of two or more of them. Usually, the line is set around their season average for that specific star; for example, Luka Doncic's season average for points 28.8, so bookmakers may set his points line at 28.5. Moreover, some key factors can swing a player into having a bad or good performance on any night. The bookmakers are experienced enough at adjusting their lines if something significant happens. Still, sometimes, they go unseen, and, on a few occasions, you get a small window to jump on before they get updated. InjuryThe primary factor is injury. When a leading player in the team suffers from an injury, the bookmakers think that their replacement in the starting line-up must get most of their production. Although the replacement will indeed increase the stats, at least two other players in the starting line-up will get an additional boost in production that sees them reach the over and vice-versa if an injured player returns to the line-up. An excellent case is when point guard Chris Paul left with an injury and Austin Rivers, his replacement in the starting line-up, receive a remarkable increase but also the likes of J.J. Reddick and Jamal Crawford improve their points and assist numbers in Chris's absence. These guys often go unnoticed by the bookmakers. MatchupsAnother essential factor in prop betting is matchups. Few teams defend some positions extremely well while giving production to other positions in spades. Usually, it is a safe bet in steering clear of the overs when your player is playing against teams like the Grizzlies or Spurs. They can able to defend every position well and rarely allow a single player to dominate the game. A team to look out for is the Boston Celtics. They can defend the guard positions very well with Avery Bradley and Marcus Smart, but on the other hand, they are the worst rebounding team. We saw Andre Drummond, the leading rebounder whose rebounding line is usually set around 14.5, claims 22 against the Celtics, which can be an easy win for the overs. The best thing to do when involving in such betting is to study the team stats and defense vs positions. There are various sites where you can get all the information.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/sports/strategy-advice-for-nba-prop-betting.html"},

After winning the Ashes at home early in January, the Aussies toured South Africa in March. The tour turned out to be the downfall of the Australian team as they not only lost the series 3-1 but lost three of their key players - Steve Smith, David Warner, and Cameroon Bancroft, for one year in the 'sandpaper gate' controversy. It shook and completely changed Australian cricket.India, though, coming from a heavy defeat in England, looked favorites as they landed down under against an under-confident Australian side. It seemed as if the places have been switched as the Indian team resembled more confident, Aggressive, bold - generally considered as a typically Australian way.First Test(Adelaide), 6-10 Dec 2018 - The first test match began on 6th December with Indian captain Virat Kohli winning the toss and electing to bat first. India lost four wickets in the first session, including Kohli's, and it looked like the same old story of the Indian team in Australia. However, one man stood tall as the wickets tumbled from the other end and made sure the team reached a respectable total of 250 in the first innings. Cheteshwar Pujara made 123 of those runs. It was time for India's lethal fast bowling attack to bounce out Australians in their fashion. India, with a lead of 15 runs, got 307 runs on the bank of Pujara and Rahane's contribution. The Aussies, though having a lost a bit of their confidence, never forgot the fighting spirit as they came close to snatching a famous win from India. Nathan Lyon tried hard but the Aussies fell short of 31 runs.

Australian captain Tim Paine won the toss and elected to bat first. The Aussie openers got off to a good start as they reached a century run stand in the opening session of the test match. Indian bowlers, led by Ishant Sharma, came back into the match as Australia got bowled out for 326. Captain Virat Kohli led from the front and scored his 25th test century in the second innings. India, however, got bowled out for 283 and gave a healthy lead to Australians. The hosts once again batted positively and gave India a target of 287 runs to chase in the fourth innings. Nathan Lyon, who already picked up a fifer in the first innings, made sure the visitors didn't stand a chance as Aussies won the match by a margin of 146 runs. The series got leveled by 1-1 as the two teams drove to Melbourne for the Boxing day test match.Brief Score: Australia - 326 &amp; 243; India - 283 &amp; 140Player of the match - Nathan Lyon (5/67, 3/39)Also Read: Third Test (Melbourne), 26-30 Dec 2018 - The heat was on between the two captains Virat Kohli and Tim Paine since the second test of the series. Indian team made some big changes in the batting as two new openers, Mayank Agarwal and Hanuma Vihari, stepped on to the field in the opening session of the test match. Debutant Agarwal gave India a strong start and was supported well by Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli's innings. Pujara scored his second century of the series as India declared on 443/7. Another young face in the Indian test squad - Jasprit Bumrah, took six wickets to bowl the Australians out for a score of 151. The never back down spirit of Aussies was then led by Pat Cummins as he bowled one of the finest spells to reduce India for 44/5. India struggled their way to get past 100 run mark and declared at 106/8, giving hosts a target of 399 to chase in the fourth innings. It was a difficult total to chase and the Indian bowlers never gave Australia a chance despite a fightback from Pat Cummins.

India declared on 622/7 and presented an equally dominating bowling performance. Kuldeep Yadav, playing his first test in Australia, picked up five wickets. The Australians were asked to follow-on.

{"heading": "The Most Wicket Accepting Bowler - Tendulkar", "author": "adamwiliams", "description": "So, which bowler had the most wicket taking spells in a match? It appears a simple question with a simple response. Unbeatable, if you ask me. A bowler has to play for over 10 to 15 days a year, almost every single day, to even come close to breaking the record of the majority of wicket taking spells in a match. If talk about the present bowling slot of bowlers, just a couple of bowlers who've ever taken 7+ wickets in a game, and who are at the end of the career, have taken over 800 or 900 wickets in complete.", "word-count": 520, "body": "Now then, let's talk about another record breaker. Billington's claim to fame was more bowlers than any other bowler ever. His tally of 1347  charms was beaten only by Kumar Dhawan and Sunil Grover. However, it does not matter, Billington is gone, and just how good was he? Now , what about this man? What was his album after coming into the bowling department? Well he bowled about 1000 runs, which can be quite an accomplishment, although some state that runs do not add up to wins anyway. But he'd win the County Championship twice, which can be quite an accomplishment too. There are many different documents for this man, but I want to keep things simple here. What was this guy's most unbeatable cricketing characteristic? It appeared to be his ability to bowl will. This means that no matter how many runs were run within an over, he would figure out how to knock out the runs that went past himwith an unbeaten bowling actions. Now then, among those questions I always get asked is that. How do somebody happen to be so many runs and be unbeatable? The answer lies in his ability to control the speed of the match. And I am not talking about a wildcat bowling action, I mean bowling 100 centuries. Now I have already noted that Kumar Dravid was once quoted as stating that Sachin Tendulkar is not a match winner. Nonetheless, this isn't entirely true, since Sachin managed to win the game by almost defeating Prince Fielder in a game played in the Caribbean Islands in the West Indies in the year 1986. However, no cricket lovers can watch the match that happened between both of these greats due to the monsoon rains and a flood. In fact, nobody was aware that this type of match was occurring until Tendulkar came out with his bat and ball for violin in the area after completing his century! Now let us look at the way that Kumar has held his conducts. One of his biggest strengths is his economical nature of bowling. He doesn't chase the ball down as harshly as some other bowlers do, making it more beatable. He keeps his wicket taking abilities under control and isn't overly aggressive on the area, unlike various other batsmen who tend to choose big hits. When he bites, he does not rely on his arms to complete the task, but he chooses timely wickets with his legs and becomes quite beatable. There are times when he bowls excessively hard, but he makes the mistake of overusing his arms and legs. Well, if we've understood that Tendulkar is not any ordinary bowler, then we need to also understand he is no standard batsman either. This Indian all-time bowler has taken to Sri Lanka by storm and he's been the talk of the nation. There are a number of different batsmen who have become amazing cricketing stars immediately, but none has been as quick as this young batsman. It was due to his great level of skill, allowing him to develop into asbeatable as he has been.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/sports/the-most-wicket-accepting-bowler-tendulkar.html"},

Early adopters will see that some applications should be refreshed for this new screen size — Instagram is somewhat broken, not surprisingly — yet the iPhone biological system for the most part adjusts rapidly, so I'd expect a whirlwind of application updates to come.", "word-count": 1164, "body": "It's a major year for the iPhone: Apple's iPhone 12 line is completely upgraded and includes four models — the iPhone 12 smaller than expected, the iPhone 12, the , and the iPhone 12 Pro Max — at a scope of screen sizes and value focuses. In all cases, Apple's additional new video includes another MagSafe charging framework, the new A14 processor, and the entirety of the promotion it can assemble for 5G.It's undeniable what separates the smaller than expected and Max iPhone 12s, however, the two 6.1-inch models in the line are strikingly comparable. The iPhone 12 and the iPhone 12 Pro have a similar fundamental plan, very much like OLED shows, and similar processors and 5G capacities. The Pro adds an additional fax camera focal point, a LIDAR sensor, somewhat more RAM, double the base stockpiling, and a gleaming tempered steel outline. All that will cost you $999, around $200 in excess of a base iPhone 12 at the transporter financed cost of $799.Presently, there are some of you who will go through the additional cash since this is the sparkling one. As a rule, I would settle on a similar decision since I have come to acknowledge my shortcomings. Yet, it merits jumping in to check whether the additional cash is justified, despite any trouble, particularly since the iPhone 12 presently has an OLED show, which implies the contrasts between the standard iPhone and the Pro are essentially a lot more modest than a year ago when the normal model had a lower-goal LCD.So the genuine inquiry for the iPhone 12 Pro is whether the little rundown of additional highlights legitimizes a generally $200 value knock from the standard iPhone 12. What's more, in case you're spending considerably more, it very well may be justified, despite any trouble to stand by a short time longer and spend another $100 on the iPhone 12 Pro Max, which will add a greater presentation and a bigger principle camera sensor with an exceptionally fascinating new sensor-move adjustment framework that could offer a colossal hop in picture quality.That leaves the 12 Pro in a peculiar spot, and truly, I think it boils down to the amount you may utilize the zooming focal point or shoot representation photographs around evening time.IPHONE 12 PRO DESIGNthe iPhone 12 and 12 Pro offer a similar major new plan, which is exceptionally gotten down to business and level — incredibly level. Virtually every other telephone has a bent edge and an undeniable fringe between the showcase and the edge, yet the iPhone 12s feels substantially more like a solitary piece. It helps me a little to remember the iPhone 5, yet more critically, it looks and feels totally different than some other present-day telephone, in the manner in which Apple is verifiably acceptable at causing more established plans to appear to be immediately obsolete.Strangely, the made right plan additionally causes the  to appear to be more significant than it really is. It doesn't look it, yet it's more slender than an iPhone 11 Pro.As I referenced, the 12 Pro is the sparkly one, and the lustrous hardened steel outline in a flash got fingerprints. This is a telephone you will be attempting to keep clean frequently on the off chance that you don't place it for a situation. Indeed, even still, this is the main iPhone in quite a while that I've been dismal about covering. It's only ideal to take a gander at.The front of the telephone is shrouded in what Apple calls 'Artistic Shield,' a mixture of glass and clay. Between the new material — you can't call it 'glass' since it's in fact not glass — and the new plan, Apple guarantees the iPhone 12 line has multiple times preferred drop execution over the past models, with a similar scratch opposition. (I drop my telephone a great deal, so I'm eager to perceive how this goes.) On the back, you'll locate a similar kind of glass as a year ago, yet the new plan ought to improve its drop execution also, Apple says. One thing Apple would not let me know is the means by which safe this tempered steel outline is to scratches constantly… and we've just placed a little scratch in the casing of our audit unit, despite the fact that all it's truly done is make a trip from the video shoot to the video shoot.The iPhone 12 Pro's OLED show is bigger than the iPhone 11 Pro, at 6.1 inches, and the telephone is marginally taller thus. The presentation is generally essentially equivalent to a year ago regarding splendor and pixel thickness, which implies it looks magnificent, despite the fact that it's as yet a 60Hz invigorate rate, which now is behind practically every Android telephone at $700 and up.There are reasons to be made about Apple's business volumes and accessible showcase board supply, yet eventually, a 60Hz presentation is essentially not… star. Undoubtedly, Apple's own iPad Pro has a ProMotion high revive rate show. In the event that you've just ever had iPhones, you won't generally see this since it is equivalent to ever. Yet, in the event that you have utilized a 120Hz showcase, the distinction in perfection when looking over is positively perceptible.On the sides of the telephone, you'll discover four standard radio wire holes, and US shows have a millimeter-wave (mmWave) receiving wire window for ultrawideband (UWB) 5G on Verizon. Apple disclosed to us that holding the telephone with your hand over this window shouldn't influence remote execution and that there's no specific direction on the best way to hold the telephone. I have huge hands and fundamentally can't hold the telephone without covering the reception apparatus window except if I attempt, and I didn't have any issues during my concise UWB tests.The rear of the telephone includes Apple's new MagSafe attractive remote charging and mount framework, which feels like what might be compared to the late spring before school unexpectedly: what's to come is splendid and energizing, and you will reexamine your entire circumstance without any preparation. Yet, the times of the Lightning connector are clearly finding some conclusion, and it's alright to be pitiful about it.MagSafe is amazingly astute as an idea and extremely fine actually. I am amped up for attractive vehicle mounts and stabilizer gimbals and different embellishments that don't need playing to append. I likewise think there will be flawless employments of the extra arrangement magnet just beneath the charging curl; that is the one that keeps Apple's simply alright wallet case joined effectively. Mac appears to be certain that a genuine MagSafe extra-biological system will create, not at all like the iPad Smart Connector. There are now outsider chargers and vehicle mounts and things being reported. (Apple claims taking its more standard cases on and off the telephone is simpler in view of the magnets, and I have no clue about the thing they're discussing. It appears to be only equivalent to ever.)", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/technology/apple-iphone-12-pro-review-ahead-of-its-time.html"},

In 2016/17, the ICC approved the player replacements in all formats of men and women’s international cricket and for first-class cricket worldwide. The rule was adopted by England and Wales Cricket Board in 2018. The rule, after a successful outcome in the domestic matches, was implemented for the international matches as well.During the Ashes 2019, Steve Smith became was struck by a Jofra Archer delivery in the first innings after which Marnus Labuschagne was named as the first concussion substitute. Smith got ruled out for the remainder of the game, and Labuschagne batted in the third innings. What Does The Rule Say? Teams will have the option of replacing a player who has sustained a head or neck injury during an international match and has subsequently been diagnosed with a concussion or suspected concussion.How Will ICC Approve An In-game Replacement? When the player is hit on the head or neck, he will need to be formally diagnosed by the team medical representative. Then an official request should be sent to the ICC match referee by the team manager or the medical representative. In the form, the representative should specify the incident and the proposed like for like replacement.What is a 'like for like' replacement? Like for like replacement is a player who was earlier not part of the playing XI of the team during the match, and offers the same duties as the player concussed. The match referee needs to make sure that a practical 'like for like' replacement is given without providing the team an excessive advantage.If a fast bowler is to be replaced, but his team only has a batting innings left in the Test match, it would be acceptable to replace that player with a spin bowler of similar batting ability. If a fast bowler is to be replaced, but his team only has a bowling innings left in the Test match on a deteriorating pitch, it should not be acceptable to replace that player with a spin bowler, rather he should be replaced by another fast bowler also check here.Case Study - How did Yuzvendra Chahal become the 'like for like' replacement for Ravindra Jadeja? In the first T20I between , Ravindra Jadeja was hit on the head by a rising Mitchell Starc's delivery. Jadeja after a brief pause faced the final four balls of the first innings before getting the medical attention. In the second innings, Yuzvendra Chahal came into the field after being named as Concussion Substitute for Jadeja - an all-rounder.This is due to the fact that India now had to bowl in the second innings, and since they lost a spinning option, Chahal was the only practical like for like replacement. They could not have replaced Jadeja with any of the fast bowlers sitting on the bench, nor any batsman could have helped in bowling innings for India.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/sports/how-did-chahal-ended-up-as-jadejas-concussion-substitute-all-questions-answered.html"},

Both Imran Khan and Kumar Sangakkara have gone from being a nobody to playing for Pakistan and India respectively. This is because these bowlers have the skills to bowl the ball over long distances and they know how to use these skills effectively. They have both been playing the sport for a long time and are already some of the best in the world.The main thing that separates a world-class cricket bowler from a regular player is that the bowling is not only accurate, but it is also very powerful. This means that if a bowler bowls over long distances, then he should be able to hit the ball hard, and often over the fence.It is important to realise that the bowler should be able to bowl with accuracy, but the average speed of the ball should be good enough to beat most batsmen. To be a world-class bowler, a bowler needs to have an excellent arm action and accuracy, and he needs to be able to keep the ball within range of most batsmen. In order for him to do this, he will need to have a good delivery pace.Bowling actions have to be precise, and when it comes to bowling, there are many different types of bowling actions to consider. A good example of this is when the ball is thrown over short distances.This means that the bowler must aim the ball at the batsman when the ball is being thrown. This is done by keeping the ball in line with the batsman as the ball is released.One of the main things that a good bowler has to master is throwing the ball over long distances, as the ball must be thrown over long distances at a constant speed. The speed of the ball needs to be high, and should be thrown over long distances at a very high angle.These stats show us a few of the different bowling techniques that bowlers use, and how they can help a batsman to hit the ball.

If you bowl a slow ball and hit a batsman outside off stump, then you will lose that match, and you will lose the match as well.This is because your opponent will get another chance, and your bowling techniques will have been used. In order to become the best bowler, you will have to learn new techniques every single time, and it is very important that you practice a lot, as bowling is important to a person's success.

But it’s not as simple as buying junior cycles in India and making them sit on them. You need to keep a few things in mind when teaching them.", "word-count": 648, "body": "Learning to ride a cycle from one’s parents is one of the fondest memories many of us have of our childhood. It’s only natural to want to teach your children the same. It’s a huge milestone that adds to a child’s self-confidence, making them feel closer to riding a motorcycle. It also helps that they learn fast. But teaching cycling isn’t as simple as buying .  Children tend to be stubborn about what they want and what they don’t. Forcing them to learn something will only sour them. So here are some tips to teach them cycling in a fun and effective way: See If They’re InterestedThere’s no point in buying junior bicycles in India if kids won’t ride them. Pushing them to do it will make teaching harder. Give them a reason to want to learn like their friends, older siblings or cousins riding it. They hate being left out. You should also keep their maturity level in mind. They must learn and follow safety rules when riding. Start EarlyMost experts agree that it’s best to start after four years or before six years of age. A child’s legs are strong enough to pedal after four. They tend to forget about falls quickly until they reach six. Waiting to teach after six might make learning how to cycle more difficult. It also helps that children tend to learn by watching others at this phase. So don’t delay teaching them for too long. Shop For The Right BikesWhen searching for the , make sure that they’re of the right size. The tire height should match the child’s height so that they can touch the ground with ease. The frame should be light so that they can pedal it effortlessly. A small child will need small wheels while a tall child will need tall wheels. Do not buy large bikes to save money. It will make cycling uncomfortable for them and delay the learning process. Teach How To Brake FirstBrakes are the most important safety mechanism of any cycle. Learning how to use it properly will help children prevent crashes. You should also get them a fixed wheel cycle so that they can stop by backpedaling. It’s useful for fidgety children who might need time to learn how to use brakes. Teach BalanceYou might want to start with bikes without pedals instead of training wheels to teach your child how to balance. You don’t have to buy separate junior bicycles in India. Remove the pedals from the one you buy and attach it when they learn to balance. You can use training wheels but your child will become dependent on them if you take longer than 4 weeks. So remove them once your child gets the basics of pedaling. Set Time LimitDragging a cycling lesson for too long will tire the child and make them feel bored. You should set a learning time for daily lessons based on their temperament. But don’t set a deadline for them to learn cycling. Different children learn at different paces. Let your child learn at their pace. Get Safety GearWhen looking for the best cycles and bikes in India, also look for safety gear. It should include a helmet, knee pads and elbow pads. The helmet should fit the child snugly. It shouldn’t fall over their eyes. You should be able to fit no more than two fingers between their chin and chin guard. Stay PositiveMany children worry about letting their parents down. Do not discourage them with phrases like ‘it’s easy, why are you taking so much time?’ Set realistic expectations about the learning process and congratulate them on their progress. Acknowledge your child’s concerns and encourage them to overcome them. Choose A Nice Place To LearnAvoid streets because the traffic might make them anxious. Go to a safe open space like a paved playground, empty parking lot or a flat field.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/sports/some-tips-to-teach-your-children-how-to-ride-bicycles.html"},

Most often people do not take Tpoxa.com seriously, considering it a useful program, or simply not paying attention to its actions. However, recent events have shown us that advertising programs need to be considered as a serious threat. A few days ago, the world was shaken by news of the largest botnet called Methbot. Group of Russian hackers created a huge network that allowed them to earn $3- $5 million dollars per day on advertising. Programs like Tpoxa.com were part of this criminal scheme. These programs, though, do not affect the financial interests of ordinary users, but cause great damage to the large advertising companies.Now on the Internet there are several standard ways of recognizing bot programs that allow to distinguish user from the robot, such as CAPTCHA, tracking mouse movements, and so on. However, if the situation with advertising programs won’t improve, the major search engines and advertising companies will introduce other standards to catch sophisticated bot software, and they will affect the convenience of using the Internet for everyone, including each user. As you can see, even if hackers do not deceive you personally, you should still prevent them, and protect your computer from advertising programs, such as Tpoxa.com.Although cheating advertisers and is the main purpose of browser hijackers, many of them perform other functions such as collecting statistics of visits or searches.

{"heading": "How to get rid of Untabs adware", "author": "John Stephens", "description": "This is a brief article about an unwanted program that is called UnTabs. We'll review its functions and after that. Except that we will explain what is UnTabs and what purpose it serves.", "word-count": 512, "body": "UnTabs is one of the many applications that you can see in the lists of applications in all browsers. We use one or two tools from this list, but the list itself consists of tens of thousands of applications. Each of them was created by someone, and, obviously, is in demand. However, if you do not accidentally stumble upon such a program, you will never hear about it, because it is absolutely useless. Let's look at the main function of the UnTabs application. The function is simple: this application allows you to collapse all open tabs in the browser in one list, and then deploy them to their original state. Frankly, hardly anyone will download this application, because it does not help you in the web surfing. Nevertheless, tens of thousands of computers around the world are already infected with the UnTabs program, and their users complain about the slowdown of the PC and the abundance of advertising.First, you need to determine how UnTabs penetrates users' computers. Since this program does not have useful functions, and the probability of direct download is extremely small, there must be another way. This method is called bundling and this is the most convenient and effective way to distribute advertising programs. Scammers are especially fond of bundling because this method requires minimal time and effort, and also removes all responsibility from scammers, because users independently install adware and confirm compliance with all conditions and additional functions. Let’s describe this method briefly: scammers create a package of free programs in which only one program is useful, and all the rest are adware or viruses. The package has the name of a single useful program, and during the installation of it user is forced to install all the programs contained in the package, while he thinks he installs only one.Now we come to another problem, namely to the fact that UnTabs does not act alone. Bundled installation implies that several viruses penetrate the computer, which means that you should worry not only about UnTabs but also about several other programs. In addition, any advertising program by its actions pushes the user to visit unreliable websites that distribute malware, from which more viruses enter the computer and so on. This circle does not break itself, and the user can break it only by removing all unwanted programs from his computer.There are two main ways to remove any virus - automatic and manual. Unfortunately in the case of UnTabs, we can not advise you to manually remove it because the abundance of viruses on the computer makes it too slow, and reduces the efficiency of manual removal. It may take many hours to completely clean the computer in the manual mode, because all adware conflicts with each other and work in the background, slowing down the system and reducing performance. In addition, many viruses are equipped with security mechanisms, such as the ability to reinstall after removal, etc. If you want to know the only reliable and effective way to completely uninstall UnTabs - read our full article on .", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/spam/how-to-get-rid-of-untabs-adware.html"},

You would most certainly be, isn’t it? You’d be surprised to know that more than 50% of the mails exchanged everyday all over the world is spam. Constantly receiving spam messages on your work email can be more frustrating as business organizations mostly use emails for all their communication.Spam is a major issue in business organizations as they flood inboxes with useless messages bringing the overall productivity of employees. Spam messages also consume a lot of resources from email servers and contribute to server outage, memory shortage and power outages. On top of that spam mails even pose security threats as few of them are not junk mails but malicious mails with infiltrate your computer systems for malicious intent. Spam filtering is the most effective counter to these unwanted messages and in this article we will discuss everything you need to know about spam filters.What is Spam Filtering? How Does it Work?Email filtering is the most effective way to keep spam at bay and the filtering is quite literally done with the help of many filters. Before sending/receiving mails from a mail server, all the mails are sent through a mail exchange record which is equipped with multiple filters designed to detect spam messages and blacklist the source of the message. These filters are technically advanced, constantly updated and have a specific way of identifying and filtering spam messages. The mail exchange record includes all of these different filters to offer a comprehensive spam filtering service.Types of Spam FiltersFew of the most commonly used email filter types are discussed below:1.  List Based FiltersThese spam filters identify and block spam messages by tracing the source of these mails and maintaining a blacklist of these sources. This way, all the messages coming from the blacklisted sources will always be blocked. Blacklist filters, real-time blackhole lists, whitelist and gray lists are the most popular list based spam filtering techniques. Similar to blacklist filters, whitelist filters maintain a list of the credible sources and only allow mails from these sources. Real-time blackhole filters are similar to blacklist filters but operate without much human intervention.2.  Content Based FiltersWhile the above mentioned spam filtering technique blocks spam by tracing the message source, this technique analyzes the message content to classify a mail as spam or otherwise. There are different types of content based spam filters namely word-based filters, heuristic filters and Bayesian filters. While word based filters look for specific spam words to filters, heuristic filters take multiple words/terms before classifying something as spam.3.  Other FiltersApart from content based and list based filters, there are many other effective spam filtering methods. A challenge response system is one of them where the message sender has to perform a task before the mail is delivered. Collaborative filter is another effective technique where inputs from millions of email users are collected to design the particular spam filter.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/spam/how-does-spam-filtering-work-and-how-does-it-help.html"},

At the initial stages, shared exchange hosting might look like a sensible choice to cut down expenses. As your business grows and volumes of mail increase, you need to shift to dedicated exchange hosting. Here are a few reasons that show why you need a dedicated exchange server hosting.1.  Lower CostsManaging exchange server in-house is not easy. You need a strong technical support team to address technical issues that may arise anytime. This can increase the cost of IT operations, and your organization would be required to spend heavily on the setup and maintenance of an exchange server.With dedicated exchange server hosting, there are no infrastructure costs involved nor your organization is required to maintain a technical support team. This reduces costs for your organization.2.  Peace of mindWhen you opt for dedicated exchange server , the vendor manages the server for you while you have granular control over the Exchange server configuration and functionality. The added features and functionality provided by Exchange server does not mean extra work for your IT team. For example, if your exchange server develops some fault at 2 am, it will be the vendor’s technical team who will fix the issue, and your IT team would not be required to wake up at odd hours.The service provider configures all components of Exchange server for you and also provides 24x7 monitoring and uptime guarantee. This ensures you have access to important business communication and data all the time.3.   Enhanced Hosting CapacityIn shared exchange hosting, the server storage space is shared between users and your organization is offered limited storage space. If you need additional storage space, you need to buy it. In dedicated exchange hosting, the entire server and its storage space are available to your organization.This allows your employees to have larger email boxes and you are less likely to face storage space crunch. Dedicated Exchange Server also comes with data storage support that allows users to share files quickly without additional software.4.  ScalabilityScalability is an important factor for organizations to meet their growing business needs. Dedicated Exchange server offers excellent scalability options. It is possible to have customized exchange servers with more storage capacity and powerful hardware.5.  Excellent PerformanceIn shared exchange hosting, the server’s processing power, bandwidth, and storage space are distributed between users. Sometimes the scarcity of the resources might lead to performance issues. In dedicated exchange server hosting, the processing power of the server, the storage space, and the bandwidth is completely available to your organization. This ensures you never face performance issues due to other users.These are some of the reasons that show why your organization needs dedicated exchange hosting. Not to mention a dedicated Exchange server also allows robust integration of additional functionalities that enhance the productivity of your workforce.Do you know any other reasons to choose a dedicated exchange server?

This will save you some hard earned cash and wasted time looking for legitimate ways to make money online. Please keep in mind, these are not facts, just my personal opinion from my past experiences. With that said, here are some tell tale signs of online money making scams that should raise your red flag.Big MoneyThis is the biggest sign that should raise your red flag. I mean if a site is promising you $5 for a click on a link, or a program promising you make thousands of dollars in a week or while you sleep, of course its a scam. If that was the case, why aren't they doing it themselves, instead of trying to make money selling you this information?...Who Are YouIf you cant find any information as to how and who to contact, or who is responsible for the site, turn around and don't look back. An established business, always have its contact info up to date and easy to find, because they are not afraid of people knowing who they are and/or authorities coming after them.Response TimeBefore signing up, contact the site/company, and ask a question or two. Usually scammers don't even bother to answer or respond to any email. Even if they do, it takes them a very long time to respond. Ask yourself if they take that long to respond to a question, how long is going take them to pay you (if they are even going to pay)?Over DecoratedScam sites for some reason tend to use a lot of flashy signs and big bold text (i know i make many internet marketers angry by saying this since they all have those flashy sites, but i believe if you have real information that will help someone make money or what have you, you don't need to pull people in with over sized and colorful text. If there is big and colorful text about the amount of money you will make, rather than detailed explanation about how you will make that money, there is a good chance its a scam. Legitimate companies usually use a simple but elegant design for their site.Fake TestimonialMost businesses use testimonial which is a good way to promote. But, if you pay close attention, you can easily spot the fake ones. For example, a testimonial about a product that helps you make more money with your site says '...with the help of the x program i have made that much money on my site. Regards, bill billy  www.bill.com ...'. If you check the mentioned site, 9 out of 10 times, either it doesn't exist or if it does, no body by that name is responsible or have anything to do with the site. Although many scammers try to have everything in place, most scam artistes (if you can call them artists) don't even take the time to at least make sure the testimonial information is right.Too EasyIf its telling you 'Make $2000 A Week, No experience Required, No Work Involved', ask your self, what kind of job you can make that much money without any experience or putting any time and effort into it? While there are legitimate ways to make that much money in short amount of time, most of them require some experience and hard work, unless you have millions of dollars to put in bank and make money with its interest.Email OffersIf you receive an email from someone you don't know and its start with 'dear friend' or something like that, and starts telling you how he/she knows this is the perfect opportunity for you to make money.... Do i need to say anything about this?.. Most people always look for ways to make more money, but i mean how could a stranger know you are looking for a way to make more money at this time, and how would he even know you? Sometimes email comes from Nigeria and other places as well.Pay A Fee And Keep It A SecretWhat legitimate company that you have worked for before, required you to pay a fee in order for them to give you more detailed information on how to make money? And why would they be afraid if you told someone about this transaction?...Gut InstinctThe best way to recognize an online money making scam is your 'gut instinct'. 99% of the time, what your instinct tells you is the truth. Most of us tend to ignore our instinct, but i have found in my experience that most of the time, my initial instinct was right.TipRemember you can always use search engines, and specially related forums to find out about legitimacy of a money making program. There are many great forums about different methods of making money online, that you can use to ask people about a specific program.There are many ways to make money online, and many great programs and methods, but always make sure you find out about ins and outs of it, before you get into it. A little time spent in researching and finding more detail in the beginning, will save a lot of money, time and frustration in the end.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/spam/9-signs-of-online-money-making-scams.html"},

Here are the most spectacular sightings to check up on when you are in the area.", "word-count": 865, "body": "Scotland has so much to offer and sometimes the best way to enjoy its beauty is on a taxi ride. One of the richest and most diverse experiences you can have is on a  ride. There are so many gems nature has to offer and so many sites that are worth visiting. Both Glasgow and Aberdeen are destinations that one should visit in a lifetime.Scotland’s largest city and one of Europe’s cultural capitals, Glasgow is a brilliant travel destination during any season. On the other hand, Aberdeen or The Granite City is famous for its local granite stone which was once used to create London’s Houses of Parliament, Trafalgar Square, Waterloo Bridge, Thames Embankment, and other eminent sites. There’s so much to see in these two cities but the best part is that there are more hidden treasures on the road between.Let’s hop on a taxi and dive into the beauties that you can see while travelling between Glasgow and Aberdeen.Stirling Castle - One of Scotland’s Greatest CastlesStirling Castle is just 22 miles away from Glasgow and is among the best-preserved castles that you can find in Europe. Apart from being the home of Mary Queen of Scots and James VI, the castle was once the key to the Scottish kingdom. It’s positioned on a volcanic rock and is considered a national monument that is certainly worth the visit. You can still feel the life that was left behind since the 12th century when visiting the castle. Explore its Chapel Royal, the Great hall, the Royal Palace.Experience StonehavenLocated just 13 miles off Aberdeen, Stonehaven is another beautiful place to explore while you’re travelling from Glasgow to Aberdeen in a taxi. The destination is famous for its breathtaking views and offers both historic attractions and mesmerizing scenery. One of its most eminent tourist attractions is the Dunnottar Castle which you can find on top of a cliff-edge. You can indulge in delicious food in a range of restaurants on the sandy and stunning harbour. Some of the most popular places to eat include The Bay Fish and Chips and Aunty Betty’s ice cream parlour.Forth Road Bridge - Modern EngineeringYou don’t have to be an engineering enthusiast to be awed by the modern and brilliant Forth Road Bridge. In case you’re wondering, Forth Road Bridge is a suspension bridge created in 1964 and connects Edinburgh to Fife. You’ll probably need to diverge slightly from the road to visit this beauty but you won’t regret it. There are a total of three Forth Bridges and they’re a major landmark. Forth Bridge is even one of UNESCO’s World Heritage Sites. What better way to take a break from the road and enjoy a quick takeaway lunch at this gorgeous site. Visit Scone Palace For a Walk Through HistoryLocated in Perth and positioned pretty much right at the centre between Aberdeen and Glasgow, Scone Palace is full of history. It’s where Scottish kings like Macbeth, Robert the Bruce, and Charles II were once crowned. Apart from the brilliant historic experience that you can get from this place, you can also enjoy its beautiful gardens. The palace holds a variety of antiques, paintings, and rare artefacts. You can also go down to the River Tay and spend some time connecting with nature in the fine woodlands on the grounds of Scone Palace.The Falkirk WheelInterested in a much more rare attraction that you can see on your way to Aberdeen from Glasgow? The Falkirk Wheel is a perfect choice. It’s the first created rotating boat lift and to date the only one you could find. Its purpose for creation was to connect the Forth and Cycle Canal and the Union Canal, enabling coast to coast navigation through central Scotland. You can enjoy a boat trip, a refreshing coffee, explore through the gift shops, or stop for a woodland walk. There are so many activities to choose from that you may be tempted to stay for longer.Enjoy the Beauty of Glamis CastleAnother site nearly located in the middle between Glasgow and Aberdeen is Scotland's most beautiful castle - Glamis Castle. Famous for being the home of the Earls of Strathmore and a royal residence since 1372, the castle is an attraction you don’t want to miss while in Scotland.

{"heading": "Sleeping in the Moroccan desert: all you need to know", "author": "Aziz Achabou", "description": "Travelling to Morocco? Here, we give you all the tips about sleeping or spending the night in the Moroccan desert. Also, we give you the characteristics of each desert.", "word-count": 1078, "body": "One of the dreams of the many tourists who come to Marrakech is to sleep in the desert and enjoy the hollow and resonant calm of the silence that invades it. As said, 'One can sit down on a sand dune and not see or hear anything, but there is always something shining in the silence'.Is it possible to sleep in the Zagora desert?It is more than possible! In fact, Zagora is the closest desert to Marrakech. This desert is the most suitable for those who have a limited time in Morocco and do not want to miss this experience. Sleeping in Zagora will ensure you a dream night under the desert sky, an opportunity you can not miss if you visit Marrakech.Which desert is better: Zagora or Merzouga?Zagora, as a desert, is much more arid and rocky than Merzouga. Because of its character as an area of reflection and rest, you will find yourself in a desert that is doomed to peace, disconnection and tranquility. A place where you can enjoy the pressing sun and the few points of vegetation, which are concentrated in isolated palm trees.Merzouga is everything you imagine when you think of walking through the desert-like Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia, besides being well known internationally for the endless dunes of Erg Chebbi that, reaching up to 150 meters high, can be as imposing as mountains.You can choose to sleep in the Zagora or Merzouga desert, but what is clear is that you will enjoy this unique experience regardless of your choice.Where do you sleep in the Marrakech desert?That will depend a bit on the type of experience and excursion to the Marrakech desert that you want to have. We don't want you to think that sleeping in the desert has to be, necessarily, an uncomfortable practice, as it is quite the opposite.Beyond the Haimas, you can find some hotels in both the Merzouga and Zagora Deserts, although, as you can imagine, there is not a great variety of options. If you allow us a tip, we recommend you to spend the night in one of the Berber camps, because that way you will feel that your experience is more real and more complete and you will be able to enjoy in a more direct way the meadow of stars that will spread in the sky of the Sahara. After all, sleeping in the Moroccan desert is something you will not do countless times in your life, so try to get the best out of this experience.What are the tents of the Moroccan desert?In the past, caravans of merchants and Berbers had to spend the night in the desert. In order to withstand the extreme temperatures and not to lose much time during their journeys, they used tents.How are the tents built in the desert?These are small tents made of animal skin, mainly camel or goat. Some large masts held the structure as well as giving enough space to the cabin. On the outside, some ropes nailed to the ground held the mast and gave stability to the construction.Inside, a small mattress and some blankets and pillows were placed to spend the night. Depending on the size, one or several people could spend the night inside. The ones we will use to sleep in the desert, although they keep their essence, are a little more modern. We can even find some with air conditioning. Nothing bad will come to alleviate the harsh temperatures of the desert.Is it advisable to spend the night in the Moroccan desert in a tent?If you want a total experience, undoubtedly YES. Usually, this is what people who make a trip to sleep in the desert of Marrakech choose and it is that sleeping in a tent as the Bedouins did is the best way to feel like one of them. In addition to being the most authentic way to spend the night in the desert, one must admit that it has quite a lot of charm.With the excursions, you will be able to sleep in a private or semi-private tent or Haima of a desert Berber camp. In addition, these types of camps are equipped with amenities that you may think are unsuitable for the desert, such as bathrooms and showers.Can I choose the type of tent to sleep in the desert?Depending on the number of people who are going to make the excursion you can choose the number of tents or the number of people in each one. If you don't mind, you can share the tent with other people, but of course, you can request one for yourself or for your partner.You can also request tents with private bathrooms or with air conditioning or showers. Everything depends on the comfort we want to have in our nights in the desert and everything we want to pay.What do you do on a tour to sleep in the desert of Marrakech?There are many hours of travel from Marrakech to the desert of Zagora (360 kilometers away) or to the desert of Merzouga (550 kilometers away), but even the transfer from one point to another is an exciting journey, as you can travel the scenic route to the camp of Haimas, a tour full of Berber villages, crossing the Anti Atlas, the Draa Valley and even take you to visit the Kasbah Ait Ben Haddou, the spectacular town of clay and stone best preserved in all of Morocco, which has served to make the declaration of World Heritage by UNESCO.You can also reach Ouarzazate, known worldwide as the Gateway to the Desert or the African Hollywood, because of the number of film studios in the city, the largest and most important of which are the Atlas Studios, and you can even ride a camel in the Marrakech desert!After visiting some of the most important and beautiful sights that are scattered along the way, you will reach the key point of the tour: sleeping in the desert of Marrakech.Whether you decide to sleep in the desert of Zagora or you choose the spectacular dunes on which to sleep in the desert of Merzouga, we recommend that you choose a Berber camp.But do not tow too much in the Haima in the morning or you'll miss the best gift that can make you sleep in the desert of Morocco: the sunrise from the top of one of its majestic dunes. soon? we can offer the best  at cheap rates.Source:  from ArticlesFactory.com", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/travel/sleeping-in-the-moroccan-desert-all-you-need-to-know.html"},

It certainly seems to be associated with the image of gentlemen's clubs of bygone days. People from ancient times have enjoyed the pleasant taste and smell of smoking pipes. Native Americans introduced pipe tobacco to European settlers in the 1600's but Asian and Middle Eastern cultures enjoyed pipes long before the custom spread to Europeans. Not only do pipe smokers value the tastes of different tobacco blends, they also enjoy the use of pipes made from a variety of materials. Meerschaum pipes are one of the most highly valued types.Meerschaum is a mineral called hydrated magnesium silicate that is found mainly in central Turkey. The name meerschaum is a German word meaning 'sea foam'. This is an apt description because the mineral is white and surprising lightweight. Meerschaum pipes absorb elements of pipe tobacco during smoking because they are very porous. Their color then gradually becomes deeper until it changes into a golden brown. Beautiful old meerschaum pipes are much sought after by collectors for this unique coloring. For those who wish to purchase their first meerschaum pipe, be sure it is actually carved out of one mineral block and not composed of meerschaum dust mixed with a binder. These pipes will not acquire that special coloration.When shopping for pipe tobacco, note that it is identified by blend names as well as brand names. The tobacco blends contain special pairings of different tobacco leaves to achieve various flavors. The Oriental leaves of Drama and Yenidje and Syrian latakia tobacco have spicy tastes and aromas. Virginia, Burley and Cavendish leaves are grown chiefly in the United States and United Kingdom. Other tobacco types are Turkish and Cigar leaf. The unique Perique leaves are cultivated only in St. James Parish in Louisiana. When harvested after the growing season the tobacco leaves are cured by air or sun. They may also be fire and flue cured. Sometimes flavors are added to the blends of leaved for additional enjoyment. Some add rum or whisky. Others add the fruit flavors of cherry and raspberry. Caramel, cocoa, vanilla or chocolate may be added for a sweeter blend.As with cigar smoking, pipe smoke is not inhaled. Rather, it held in the mouth to savor its flavors and sensations while the nicotine is absorbed through the nasal cavities. Pipes are lit with a match or a special pipe light. The match is struck and the sulphur on the tip allowed to burn off before lighting the tobacco. Lit pipes are usually held by the stem but sometimes by the bowl. Meerschaum pipes are gripped with a patch of chamois leather or held by the stem to prevent its color change from becoming uneven.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/traffic-analysis/the-pleasurable-hobby-of-pipe-smoking.html"},

{"heading": "Paddleboarding Holiday Tips", "author": "Lisa Jeeves", "description": "Paddleboarding can be a child friendly activity with a little thought and preparation. Our team at Summit & Blue offer some tips on what to pack.", "word-count": 464, "body": "What to Pack When Taking Your Kids PaddleboardingPaddleboarding, or stand-up paddling (SUP) is becoming an increasingly popular child friendly activity for families looking to try something a little different. Stand-up paddling is a child friendly activity because children of any fitness level can benefit from its emphasis on coordination, balance and building confidence. With these positives in mind, why not give paddleboarding a go? It’s easy enough to get into and your family will love having fun out on the water.Paddleboarding EquipmentThere are three different types of paddleboard, each suitable for various skill levels. These are stock, 14 foot and unlimited, with the stock board starting at 12 ft. For your children though, a board at around the 8-9 ft range is ideal and wouldn’t require the effort needed to paddle the larger models.One of the advantages of the longer boards is that you have room for your children to perch on the board while the adult paddles. SUP boards are specific to a number of other things, including ability, type of paddleboarding and budget. Generally speaking, SUP boards are pretty expensive to buy outright and hiring is usually the best option, unless of course your family is serious about turning paddleboarding into a hobby. You’ll need a paddle as well, but a suitable hire point should provide for you and the family.Keeping SafeObviously safety is paramount to turning paddleboarding into a child friendly activity. Some things to consider are where you and your family intend to paddleboard; is it going to be in a tranquil lake with perfectly calm waters, or are you heading out into the ocean where things like the current can be a factor. Going on an organised SUP activity across a lake is probably the safest introduction to the sport, but a well prepared voyage into the ocean can be a rewarding experience. Regardless of where you choose, you’ll need a life jackets or buoyancy aids for each family member. These start from £30 and up but as with the board and paddle, hire points should provide one for each family member. For added safety, make sure any SUP board you buy or hire comes with a leash so that in the event of someone falling they don’t lose their board.You should also take into account the climate of the destination for your paddleboarding adventure. If it’s hot then pack rash vests for the children and if it’s cold then it’s imperative that you invest in wetsuits for them.ConclusionPaddleboarding is a child friendly activity that will bring out the best in young and old. You’ll learn on the calmer waters of the lakes and there will be plenty of opportunities for videoing dad as he tries to keep his dignity and his balance on the paddleboard he is mastering.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/traffic-analysis/paddleboarding-holiday-tips.html"},

{"heading": "Basic Steps to Help Save Money when Visiting Geneva", "author": "Lisa Jeeves", "description": "It’s possible to experience the beautiful city of Geneva without spending large sums of money. Here are some top tips.", "word-count": 478, "body": "Geneva is a very beautiful city and it regularly attracts large numbers of visitors.It’s perfectly possible to wax lyrical about its many attractions but few would claim that Switzerland is one of the cheapest countries in Europe to visit. Many visitors are, naturally, operating on a limited budget and they’re also therefore keen to identify ways they can cut costs.Here are a few tips that you may find useful:• Look for consolidated tourism tickets. For example, if you love art and museums, then search out what’s called the “Museum Passport”. It offers good discounts based upon visits to several different museums.  • Economic rail travel can be found through deals with SBB/CFF. • Budget dining is possible through “Allons Manger!” This is a French site offering discount vouchers for restaurants and some Geneva restaurants join in too.• Switzerland is famous for its leisure, and sites such as “Groupon” as well as “Deindeal” make available some good discounts.• “Geneve Roule” is a good site for hiring bikes. They’re modestly priced, green and healthy!• REKA is an interesting site for budget hotels and cheap holiday deals. Accommodation in Switzerland isn’t the cheapest in Europe, so think ahead and look for special deals advertised through the “Swiss Hotel Portal”. If you can, be flexible on your travel dates too. That helps find those special offers hotels are proposing in order to fill rooms during their quieter periods.• Check out the local bric-a-brac and antique stores. Geneva is famous for them and there are some surprising bargains to be found. Granted, they’re not there every single day and there is some ‘tat’ to wade through but even so, you’ll be able to find good quality items and at a fraction of the new retail cost - if you’re patient.• Swiss supermarkets often discount their food after 5pm in the evening and Saturday afternoons – that’s usually to clear stocks and short shelf-life items. You can save substantial sums if you shop then. If you’re staying any length of time, look also for the loyalty card schemes.• Dine out at lunch as opposed to the evenings. Geneva has been very influenced by French culture over time and therefore special lunchtime deals are very popular and often offer huge savings over evening time set menus and particularly ‘à la carte’.• Buy things in France! Geneva actually sits partly in French territory and some things in France, notably supermarkets, clothing and perhaps day-to-day household goods, will all typically be cheaper there. There is a theoretical 300 Swiss Franc limit to how much you can bring back over into Switzerland but it’s worth looking into.Getting to GenevaNumerous scheduled and some budget airlines fly into Geneva. Airport transfers into the city centre are frequent and reasonably priced. However, you can also reach the city by train, and there are good road connections to other parts of Europe.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/traffic-analysis/basic-steps-to-help-save-money-when-visiting-geneva.html"},

What are the pros and cons of doing it yourself or hiring a professional? Do you know the difference between paid and organic traffic? If you are unsure of any of your answers, please enjoy the following article.", "word-count": 834, "body": "Part Two: You Have a Website; How Do You Attract New Clients?In last week’s article, we talked about setting up the tools you’ll need to evaluate your website traffic in response to your online marketing efforts. And now it’s time to come up with an online marketing plan.There are two broad categories to look at for your online marketing: Paid and OrganicPaid Website TrafficThis term refers to all instances of purchasing ads for buying ‘reach’ and/or by paying to promote a post on social media. There are many different ways to buy visibility with an audience that it has become a massive industry unto itself. Google, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and all others are worth what they are because of the paid component.It’s an essential part of any marketing strategy and not something you should attempt yourself unless you want to study this fast-paced industry and essentially become an expert in this field. Otherwise, you will spend a lot of time, money and energy with no guaranteed results.Instead, hire an online marketing professional for help with this.Organic Website TrafficOrganic traffic means visitors finding your website in a variety of ways that didn’t require you paying for that traffic to find you.There are several ways to reach an audience through organic means. Before you begin any of the tactics described below, it’s important to first define who your target market is, what your brand positioning should be and also understand what your competitive advantage is.Once those key planning strategies are in place, it’s time to implement the following to help drive qualified traffic to your website. Here are three online tactics to pursue:1. Content MarketingContent marketing is strategically creating website content that will appeal to your ideal target market so they can then get to know, like and trust you more and ultimately convert into a paying customer. Essentially, you’re looking to establish yourself as an authority, entertain your users, and educate them.Aside from creating compelling content, you also want to make sure that content is sending proper rank signals to Google by ensuring it is of value to the visitor as well as being unique. Content marketing is everywhere and nobody wants to read the same article for the hundredth time with a different voice saying the same thing.When content is great, it gets linked to by other websites. These links are a major part of how Google evaluates your website for rank so great content not only drives traffic back, it also sends a positive message to Google that your website is worth ranking higher for the terms you’re targeting with your content.Content marketing has been such a booming part of SEO it’s now harder than ever to be a voice in your industry so make your content count. 1 good piece of content is worth more than 1,000 bad ones.2. Local Business ListingsLocal business listings are easy to find and can be added by yourself via these local SEO tools listed here or your SEO marketer can also help with this. Some are paid but most are free. Of any of the DIY methods for SEO this is the advisable one since it’s an easy process and many SEO agencies will charge monthly fees for simply running the software.3. Social Media Marketing This is the seemingly simplest method of driving traffic to your website and the one most done wrong. Many business owners don’t realize the purpose of using social media for business marketing is to drive traffic back to their website. This disconnect often causes a lot of wasted time and effort.Social media management without SEO strategy is simply a PR campaign. All social platform links are what’s called ‘nofollow’ links so they never factor into your rank without a strategy in place that makes use of them in spite of the links being nofollow.When you pay for a social media marketing expert, you are getting the know-how to make your social media efforts count. Simply posting a lot is not going to do it. And hashtag spamming is a sure sign you’ve hired someone who doesn’t know how social media marketing or even hashtags work.Your social media is your way of connecting to your audience and Google observes that when traffic is sent through from a disconnected service. Your audience can grow much faster by reaching the right people but your content has to be unique and enjoyable to have an impact.Feeling overwhelmed at the volume of effort needed to market your business? Find an online marketing agency who can work with you and your expertise so your input and knowledge of your industry is the guide when creating content that is presented as being from your company.Both users and Google will respond better to something of substance than anyone simply pumping out content for the sake of having something online.Also remember the point from earlier about the value of social media and make sure you’re leveraging the paid component or you’re missing out on a lot of your reach opportunity.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/traffic-analysis/online-marketing-plan-essentials-3-ways-to-drive-qualified-traffic-to-your-website-in-droves.html"},

It’s one word that speaks a thousand words for the brand and makes a groove in the minds of the customers or people casually coming across the said logo. Therefore, its importance can’t be over emphasised. It definitely calls for immense amount of application of thought and formulation of branding strategy before it’s readied and presented to the world.", "word-count": 574, "body": "People are of the belief that preparing logo is a small feat. Whereas it actually takes immense skill and artwork to prepare a logo of a brand that actually is a face of the brand and forms image in public that they can associate with.Although there are no set rules in logo designing, its best crafted through experience. It’s based on the past designs by the best designers and the methods they used to craft a logo. This will give the insight into what works best for them and the brands and what does not.However, theoretically the guidelines can be summed up as follows in the mnemonic- SMART—SIMPLE- Simple designs convey the right message to the right audience. It gives clarity of message, is memorable and has ease in giving quick brand recall. It has an aesthetic appeal that provides industry relevance at the same time and evokes emotional reaction. The major advantageous feature of a simple logo is that it gives recognisability in a glance to the target audience.MEMORABLE- it’s a component of branding and brand strategy that grabs attention and gives the needed brand identification. Recently in the year 2020, studies have shown that attention span of people at large has reduced from earlier 12 seconds to now 8 seconds only. So the need to have a catchy and a memorable logo was never felt so strongly before. It also differentiates our brand from the competitors’ as it creates first impression in the minds of the target audience and evokes brand loyalty.APPROPRIATE- A logo needs to be proper and appropriate and by being appropriate implies knowing your audience and recognising what will go down well with them and accordingly striking the right cord with them. An appropriate logo delivers the true essence of the client’s brand, establishing brand identity and creative branding includes devising branding strategies and design strategies in alignment with what the brand stands for and what it wants to convey. All that reflects in the designing style and branding guidelines as to the kind of style a brand decides to use. For example, Windows, Virgin Mobiles, Oreo biscuits etc are the perfect examples to demonstrate fitting colours, and fonts are so crucial and integral to forming their logo.RESIZABLE- Another important aspect that logo designers factor into is the resizeability. Many clients want to look effective. Brands that use emblems incorporate text, icon or symbol of any sort like a seal or a badge then it should be ensured that the logo is equally visible. It should look as clear from a distance of 10 metres as it would look from a distance of 10 millimetres. Like HP or GE logos, when used for smaller uses, still yield same size and shape. TIMELESS- A logo has to have the quality of timelessness instead of falling for the fads that come and go in the industry for a short period of time. A timeless logo is one that does not use complicated graphics or gradients but use limited colours. A logo that does not overwhelm other components of the logo is a timeless one. A simple and uncluttered logo with minimalistic designs and layouts will look equally good on a billboard as it will look on facebook page like gelato ice cream, noodle bar etc. Therefore, a brand logo is to be designed keeping in mind all the pointers. A brand must therefore empanel an ad agency that adds immense value.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/web-design/creative-agency-for-logo-designing.html"},

The direct benefit is simply more people finding your profile and connecting with you and visiting your website. The indirect benefit is from an extra link pointing to your website from your profile. Here are some quick tips on how to make the most of your SMO efforts.  Social sharing tools should be integrated into your site architecture. Include direct web links to your social media channels from your website and from your social profiles back to your website. You can also add social media sharing buttons to individual blog posts.Links on social media are often considered higher-quality links because social sites have a high web authority. Even if your Facebook page is brand new, it’s likely to rank well in the SERP’s because of Facebook’s overall high authority.  Creating your social profile seems like a simple task, yet it’s one of the first areas where businesses tend to fall short. Fill out the profile information 100%. Search engines tend to favor profiles with complete information available. It also creates a more professional cohesive experience for others in your network, so all the contact information in your social profiles should be exactly the same as they are on your website.  If you want to keywords play a very strong role. In fact, if you’re not optimizing your profiles correctly, you’re leaving money on the table for your competitors. Structure your keywords and target key phrases into your social profiles in a natural, non-spammy way. If you can effectively use your keyword or phrase in your profile or page name, it will help it rank better in keyword searches on Google and within the social network search itself.  Keywords are important for your website, blog content, and ad campaigns, so it should come as no surprise that keywords matter with your social content, too. This also helps keep your content relevant to your target audience.  It’s called SOCIAL media for reason, duh! Social signals are an important factor in SEO because search engines look at social signals and factor in how often you’re posting, how many people interact with you, and if there are social sharing elements available to website visitors. Brands often forget that  is to build relationships. It’s not a set and forget type of medium. Get out there and participate in conversations, follow your customer base, and share helpful content from both your website and other relevant sites.  I can’t stress the importance of always putting your best foot forward and staying on brand. The cover image is typically the first thing a user sees when he or she visits your page, and you want to give them a good impression. Use this opportunity to convey your brand messaging to your current and prospective followers/customers. Use recommended size guides for each platform to ensure that your cover image is formatted and displayed correctly, and always use professional images that are relevant and memorable.  Lastly, never allow employees to use a personal e-mail address to create or manage your brand social media accounts. Always use a company controlled e-mail account. You can’t optimize an account you no longer have access to due to employee turnover.Social media can be one of your greatest assets for improving your site’s organic search results if properly utilized. Following these 7 steps will help you make the most of your optimization efforts.Need additional help? Get a free Digital Marketing Analysis.

You must have seen the lines of emojis expressing different emotions: crying, laughing, heart, flower, Christmas tree, etc. This looks really poor. Each emoji Carrie's a single idea so it's really inappropriate to use various emojis at the end of a text just to make it look funny. Nothing can be worse than using emojis incorrectly in media marketing. Below we are going to review several common mistakes in using emojis and help you not to repeat the same mistake. Emojis are not just little smiles, gloomy faces, hearts, etc. They express emotions so when you add them to your post on social media, they must make sense.

Emojis tend to oversimplify things, so if you are talking about serious issues like loans or disease, it's best to avoid using emojis because it seems like there is no appropriate face that would comply with serious matters. One of the most popular examples of the wrong use of emojis was Hillary Clinton's post on Twitter: 'How does your student loan debt make you feel? Tell us in three emojis or less.' This was certainly not the best tactic since the topic of the post is serious and could have been painful for someone. Another common problem with using emojis is using them too much. A nice way to use emojis is when you use one winking when you post teasing content, smiling one when you share happiness, and a heart when you love/like something/someone. Emojis should be a natural continuation of your thought. If you add emojis just to make your post on social media attractive, don't do it. Some people are very good with emojis; they automatically add an appropriate 'face' that seems just perfect for ending up a thought. If you sell flowers, cakes, and clothes, adding a heart at the end of a message is fine. However, if you are having a chat with a customer of your computer repair company. However, using emojis is down to you. If you want to have friendly and warm relationships with your customers regarding the business you have, then you can choose to use any emojis. However, it's not considered professional and can push some people away.You can even create your own emojis and draw the attention of the audience with your unique content. Think of a little picture that would comply with your brand. Of course, it will take some time and efforts but drawing attention will be so easy once it's ready and posted. Such an awareness-boosting technique does work: political organizations, as well as non-governmental organizations, have already created unique emojis that help they capture attention and differ from so many other person social media.Emojis are simply great. People often underestimate them thinking sarcastically about those yellow faces expressing different emotions. Adding a smiley face or a thumb up at the end of a message can make a good impression. If receiving a message with an emoji from someone who you have never met in person made you smile, then you know that it works. It's not that difficult to learn how to use emojis in your posts, messages, and comments on social media. Learn the definition of each and add them to text to make it more lively.It's time to forget about old concepts and learn trends. You may think that using symbols is not serious. However, symbolic language as important as writing. The best way to start using emojis is by imagining with what facial expression you are saying something. Review the list of emojis and choose one that has the same expression as you. Also, read posts of other people and see how others react to them. Using emojis is a lot of fun just remember that a smiley face or a heart is not appropriate in any situation. We also believe that our goal was achieved: you know what emojis are for, when you should and shouldn't use them and how these little cute faces can help you grow the audience and make them like you through the screen of their devices.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/viral-marketing/using-emojis-in-your-social-media-posts.html"},

If the price is economical and 100% guaranteed results are promised then go for it. When it comes to SEO, you should have proper on-page SEO, well written content, good usability, excellent content marketing strategy, and a winning social media strategy.Search engine optimization, is a term that is actually a conglomeration of many small to big factors and tactics. It is not mere inserting the keywords in the content. But, we know that the aim of SEO is to lift our page or site to get good ranking. It is almost very clear that the use of keywords is for searching the relevant content on the search engines. They are used to rank the pages in the search engines. Though writing relevant content without keywords help your page rank well, it still matters to choose the appropriate keywords and using them in right way is important part of small business SEO services. Simply choosing the appropriate keywords is not mere thing of a functional SEO program, but ambitious choices of keywords can be bolstered by guest blogging, linking, and strong branding. Why would the use of keywords as an anchor text will hurt the linking strategy? If that is all you do, then it looks like spam. Matt Cutts said on using keywords as anchor text for links as, “The objective is not to make your links appear natural; the objective is that your links are natural.” This myth was perpetuated by some sites providing domain space, so it is easy for them to sell .com and .org domains at higher ranking than domains, which are less popular. Searchers will trust on your site if it has a recognizable domain level for example, .com, the extension will not affect where you show up in the page rankings. Practically, if you run a burger restaurant, having a .burger domain might be of good sense and will actually draw public’s attention to your site as compared to the .com domain. It is probably perpetuated by low-quality SEO professionals in small business SEO services those are happy to just slap the keywords into their content that their client thinks best and they do not want to take the time to either test those keywords for competition and for traffic or find new keywords that would be better for their client.Keyword research is not only finding keywords with high search volume or low competition, though it is a big part of the whole process. It is about making sure you have the keywords to let you get your link in front of the interested and engaged people possible. The myth arises as guest blogging is no longer important and it was when it comes to the ranking factor. This led many expert SEO services to declare the practice and cut it out of their services, although guest blogging is very much popular. It is still one of the best option to build high-authority links. Guest blogging is so much alive and it is still a great way to draw organic and new traffic to your site. For More Information, Visit Website:", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/viral-marketing/you-should-know-these-myths-on-small-business-seo-services.html"},

It is so important that many consider it the gateway to the internet. Unfortunately, Google uses its dominant position to determine what we (and its workers) can see, say, do or publish.", "word-count": 316, "body": "Until a few years ago, Google had an instant search feature where it showed you real-time search results as you entered your search term into the search bar. Users soon noticed the feature stopped working when they typed certain words. They later discovered the feature tripped off because Google had censored those words.While many of the words were vulgar, some were innocuous with no sexual undertone. This includes words like Latina, ectasy, amateur, ball kicking, Asian babe, fantasies, fetal, girl on, incest, licked, lovers, mature, submissive, teen and Google is evil.[9]A spokesperson said the search giant had a problem with its algorithm. The algorithm censored a word if previous users used it as part of a sexual term. However, this affected searchers seeking nonsexual results. The spokesperson said Google was working on removing inoffensive words from its list of censored words.[Google has mailing lists and forums where employees debate, share information or just discuss random topics of interest. Everyone could discuss anything on the forums and mailing lists until 2019, when executives banned political discussions.Executives also forbade employees from making statements that “insulted, demeaned or humiliated” other employees or the company’s business partners. The meaning of “business partner” is vague. However, judging by Google’s recent antics (including the firing of two conservative programmers), your guess is as good as mine.[Google censors any website it suspects of spamming its users. However, it once took things to the extreme when it blocked every website under the .co.cc subdomain.The subdomain had over 11 million websites, making it one of the largest domains in the world. It belonged to a South Korean company that allowed users create free websites and up to 15,000 websites for just $1,000.Google said it blocked the subdomain for hosting many spam websites. While that sounds reasonable, it does not change the fact that Google had taken things too far. That subdomain contained many legitimate websites.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/viral-marketing/top-10-ways-google-is-censoring-free-speech-22.html"},
{"heading": "Top 10 Ways Google Is Censoring Free Speech 1/2", "author": "Saif RashidEtc", "description": "Google is the foremost search engine in the world. It is so important that many consider it the gateway to the internet. Unfortunately, Google uses its dominant position to determine what we (and its workers) can see, say, do or publish.", "word-count": 995, "body": "Google AdSense is the largest ad network on the internet. It is also one of the most censored. Google forces partner websites to censor their content to its taste. By censor, we mean it forces them to either edit or delete anything it does not like.Website owners have only one choice and that is to comply, if they still want to remain on the AdSense network.Google says it only tells website owners to remove content that are not “family-friendly”. However, website owners have pointed out that the meaning of “family-friendly” is at the discretion of Google.Website owners only receive emails asking them to remove ads from certain content for violating Google’s “Terms and Conditions”. This is the best a website owner will receive from Google. Requests for more information will always hit a brick wall.[1]You may recall that Listverse recently published a list of articles that Google had compelled it to suppress in the very manner described here. You can discover (and read) the lists Google wanted us to remove here:Google was a major force in the Chinese search engine market until it exited the country in 2010. Google said it left because it could not cope with China’s censorship laws. It appears, however, that Google had a change of heart few years later.In 2017, The Intercept revealed Google was planning to return to China and was willing obey the Chinese government this time. It was developing a search engine that censored results on democracy, human rights, religion and protests. Google called the search engine Dragonfly.Google only canceled the project after series of protests. It appears, however, that we have not heard the last of it. While appearing before the US Senate, Karan Bhatia, Google’s vice president of public policy, said he could not confirm that Google will not build another censored search engine for China.Many governments, including those of the so-called free world, often direct Google to censor certain contents on blogger, search and YouTube. Governments (and political parties and billionaires) tell Google to remove content for a variety of reasons. Defamation, privacy, hate speech, national security and copyright infringement are some well-grounded reasons we know. Winning elections and swaying public opinion in political matters is another (that is most definitely not well-grounded).There are many illogical reasons a government will ask Google to remove something from the internet. Governments can (and do) ask Google to remove anything they find offensive. It doesn’t need to break any law. The government just needs to hate it.Argentina made Google remove content exposing a government official for sexual harassment. Brazil made Google remove blog posts and search results that criticized court judges and exposed fraud.Germany asked Google to delete a Google Maps review involving two government officials working with the child protective service. The officials had allegedly sexually abused two children. However, the district administration transferred one of the affected personnel from the region instead of sending them to court.There are many more and this is just a tip of the iceberg. Google says it doesn’t always comply with these requests, but we do not how true this is.In 2019, Google’s CEO, Sundar Pichai, canceled the weekly Thank God Its Friday (TGIF) meetings. Going forward, the meeting will hold once a month and discussions are restricted to Google’s business.The weekly TGIF meeting was a Google tradition that dates back to 1999. Google was a small company at the time and the meetings were what you will expect from a close-knit community.The meetings got tensed as Google grew larger. Discussions often revolved round workplace issues. Employees complained about Google’s censorship, close relationship with the US government, sexual harassment and so on.The meetings strained the relationship between employees and management. Even Page and Brin stopped attending because they just couldn’t deal with it. The memos of the meetings also leaked to the press, which was embarrassing for Google.In 2012, the Language Council of Sweden added a new word to the Swedish language. That word was “ogooglebar”, which it described as “[Something] you can’t find on the web with the use of a search engine”.Google took interest in the word and asked the council to replace “a search engine” with “Google”. The council refused, saying Swedes already used it for anything they could not find using any search engine. Google, however, insisted it wanted the word to refer to anything that is not on Google.The council refused and removed the word from its official list of Swedish words. A spokeswoman said the word remained a Swedish word, even if it was not going to be official. Google may stop the council from using the word, but it cannot stop regular Swedes from using it in their day-to-day conversations.[In 2019, YouTube took down over 300 of Trump’s reelection ads for no reason. Actually, it said it took the ads down for breaching “company policy”.YouTube refused to provide more information about how the ads breached “company policy” or what company policy it breached. It however denied removing the ads for political reasons. Its CEO, Susan Wojcicki, said the ads were unapproved. This is even though the ads had been running for a few days.In November 2018, 20,000 employees and contractors walked out of Google’s offices in 50 cities across the world. They were protesting several issues including worker’s rights, sexual harassment and Google’s poor treatment of contractors.The protest was a success. Google made some changes to appease the protesters and praised Claire Stapleton and six others for their role in the protest. That was just on the surface. Underground, it declared war on Stapleton and other protest leaders.Stapleton left Google the following year. She said her career took a downward turn after the protest. Her supervisors shunned and put her under so much stress that she just had to resign.[7]They threatened to demote her and only backtracked after she involved her lawyers. However, they got more hostile towards her, gave her work to other people and advised her to go on medical leave.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/viral-marketing/top-10-ways-google-is-censoring-free-speech-12.html"},

Your customers will be taken aback when they'll scan a printed QR code and see a 3D message popping up.", "word-count": 1218, "body": "QR codes and Augmented Reality (AR) are two distant technologies with many differences. QR codes are two dimensional, whereas AR is three dimensional. QR codes link to web pages and multimedia, whereas AR is used to deliver augmented experiences. But amid these differences, there's one similarity that makes the collaboration of QR codes and AR a possibility. In this post, we'll discuss how AR and QR codes can be used together for better customer engagement.  Quick Response (QR) codes and Augmented Reality (AR) are two emerging technologies taking the world by storm. Well, QR codes aren't technically 'emerging' because they've been out there for about two decades. AR, however, is a relatively new concept. A QR code is an evolved, 2D barcode that users can scan with their smartphones. You can link the code to a wide range of web content, such as a website, video, image, document, form, coupon, and more. The codes are easy and inexpensive to generate. You can easily create a QR code with a QR code generator app. On the other hand, AR provides an enhanced 2D or 3D view of something. Think of Pokemon Go, a game that disrupted the mobile gaming world when it was launched in 2016. But the applications of AR aren't restricted to gaming or entertainment. Businesses can use AR to provide augmented, real-world experiences to their customers. When a consumer scans an AR marker, the information in the form of a 3D model appears. At its core, AR markers are similar to QR codes. The user scans them and accesses content. Besides, AR markers may also contain QR codes. So, despite differences, the purpose of QR codes and AR markers is the same. This results in an opportunity for amalgamation. Businesses can use QR codes and AR together to provide a superior quality experience to their customers.  QR codes allow you to share web and multimedia content with ease. Users can scan the code and get access to information from their smartphone. Since almost all modern-day smartphones come with QR-code-scanning capabilities, you can make your marketing campaign accessible to anyone. Here's how a typical QR code interaction works. You generate a QR code and link the desired information with it. It could be a website link, landing page, social media profile, etc. When a user scans the code, he'll be redirected to that content. Since the type of information that can be integrated with QR codes is diverse, you can diversify your marketing and advertising efforts. AR experiences have recently become popular among brands. Companies are utilizing AR to provide real-world, enticing experiences to their customers. But here's the problem. AR codes aren't easily accessible to users. While all modern phone cameras support QR code scanning capabilities, This leads to a usability gap, which could be overcome by QR codes. You can include AR markers in the center of the QR code and define a specific 3D scene for the marker. This way, a phone camera with QR-scanning capabilities would be able to access AR markers and access AR-based content.  Augmented reality QR codes are a new concept. Your customers will be taken aback when they'll scan a printed QR code and see a 3D message popping up. Let's say you want to use AR for customer support, so you put up an AR-enabled QR code on your product package. When a customer scans the code, a 3D-form of a customer executive appears.All of this is possible with the help of an AR-based QR code. Let's look at some of its features. AR is awesome, but what if you want to deliver a simple message, say a notice or form? A big advantage of AR-based QR codes is trans-media capability. You can use them to provide a wide range of experiences, ranging from simple text to AR content. Augmented reality QR codes work just like normal QR codes. You can print them on paper and put them up on a wall or any flat surface. They don't require any electricity to be functional, making them fully passive. Even if your business is temporarily closed, the codes will remain active. Users can scan them and get information about your business. Creating AR-enabled QR codes is cost-effective. You can easily get a  and start making professional augmented reality QR codes. Not many ways exist to deliver high-quality AR experiences, and the ones that exist aren't economical or easy to implement. Augmented reality QR codes are different. QR codes are known to function even if they're 30% damaged. So practically, you can put up an AR-based QR code and forget about it. It would continue to work as a passive marketing strategy and help you generate leads and conversions.  To understand this concept, we'll need to delve into AR.js. It's a JavaScript library that enables developers to add AR capabilities and functionality to any website. In a nutshell, AR.js allows you to implement cross-browser AR on the web. And it all starts with a marker for AR.js. When the marker is scanned, the AR.js gets triggered, and the users get redirected to the AR web app. Here's a quick process to create an AR-enabled QR code. Your augmented reality QR code is ready. Your consumers can now scan the code and enjoy a seamless AR experience on their smartphones.  Now, where can you use AR-based QR codes? The opportunities are endless. You can put these codes in your store along with a packaged product. Your customers can scan the code and see the AR model of the product. This would give them more insights into the products and help them make informed purchase decisions. But that's just one example. There are several other ways to use augmented reality QR codes. Let's take a look at them. Let's say your target customer was waiting for a bus at the bus station when he notices your billboard ad. But at the same time, he also sees the bus coming. In general, the customer would have to ignore the ad and board his bus. But if your ad has an AR-enabled QR code, the customer can scan the code and see the advertisement on his mobile. AR is becoming increasingly popular in the education industry. Let's say you're teaching physics, and you want to explain the working of a rectifier to your customers. But the working of a rectifier is a complex process, something which can't be explained properly on the whiteboard or through textbooks. To resolve this issue, schools can include augmented reality QR codes in their textbooks. Students can scan the code and check out the 3D model of the rectifier. Are you selling a product that's difficult to install and use? Maybe an AR guide could help. You can include an augmented reality code on the product packaging and link it to an AR product tutorial. The customer can simply scan the code and watch the real-world tutorial to understand the product's installation and working.  This isn't the first time two different technologies with unique applications and capabilities are forged together to make something exciting and useful. With augmented reality QR codes, you can provide AR experiences to your customers through QR codes. With a simple scan with the smartphone, your customers will be able to access high-quality AR content.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/viral-marketing/augmented-reality-and-qr-codes-are-they-the-next-big-thing.html"},

Modern cost accounting originated during the  when the complexities of running a large scale business led to the development of systems for recording and tracking costs to help business owners and managers make decisions.In the early industrial age, most of the costs incurred by a business were what modern accountants call '' because they varied directly with the amount of production. Money was spent on labour, raw materials, the power to run a factory, etc. in direct proportion to production. Managers could simply total the variable costs for a product and use this as a rough guide for decision-making processes.Some costs tend to remain the same even during busy periods, unlike variable costs, which rise and fall with volume of work. Over time, these '' have become more important to managers. Examples of fixed costs include the depreciation of plant and equipment, and the cost of departments such as maintenance, tooling, production control, purchasing, quality control, storage and handling, plant supervision and engineering.In the early nineteenth century, these costs were of little importance to most businesses. However, with the growth of railroads, steel and large scale manufacturing, by the late nineteenth century these costs were often more important than the variable cost of a product, and allocating them to a broad range of products led to bad decision making. Managers must understand fixed costs in order to make decisions about products and pricing.For Example: A company produced railway coaches and had only one product. To make each coach, the company needed to purchase $60 of raw materials and components and pay 6 labourers $40 each. Therefore, the total variable cost for each coach was $300. Knowing that making a coach required spending $300, managers knew they couldn't sell below that price without losing money on each coach. Any price above $300 became a contribution to the fixed costs of the company. If the fixed costs were, say, $1000 per month for rent, insurance and owner's salary, the company could therefore sell 5 coaches per month for a total of $3000 (priced at $600 each), or 10 coaches for a total of $4500 (priced at $450 each), and make a profit of $500 in both cases.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/web-hosting/dbskjbdjksdbkasjdbjsdbdsjsdb.html"},

It is not hosted on any physical hardware (that only used by you) instead it is hosted on virtual servers that are managed by the cloud service hosters. A virtual server can be created in seconds and also can be dismissed when no longer needed. Like any other hosting where you can save your data offline in hardware cloud computing stores the data online from where you can access it any time. It is cost-effective as you only have to pay for the virtual server space used by you and you can access it anytime you want without paying anything extra for it.With cloud computing, businesses can keep their focus on the core business without the huge cost incurred on expanding computer infrastructure and also minimize IT infrastructure cost. It is more reliable as rather being hosted a single server it is hosted on multiple virtual servers which computer power from the underlying network of web servers. If one server is not working then it continues to draw power from remaining servers having no effect on the website. It is useful for a large and small business with workload and data to be stored online to minimize costs.What is Dedicated Hosting? is a type of Internet hosting, where you can own have the entire web server to yourself. Here clients can rent an entire web server to themselves. It is a contrast to shared hosting where you have to share hosting with other website owners. As having a server solely to yourself you can set up host for the specific needs of the business. It also provides you with high performance and server stability so you can run your business website smoothly without having to worry about server down problem. Dedicated Server Hosting Australia is basically used by large businesses as it provides fast performance and a high level of security.ConclusionThere are many companies that provide you free and premium hosting services that offer various plans at different prices.

It is important to buy a VPS in a location from where your major chunk of traffic comes from.Reliability &amp; PerformanceThe hardware that a VPS is built on is very important to deliver a reliable performance and service.

So, during this time website hosting will be down and it will be live once all activities done.Some companies claim that they will provide 99.9% uptime for your website. This UPTIME is achievable and your website will not be down for much time.If your website is generating good amount of traffic or you have high budget then don’t go for shared hosting plans and should choose VPS or other high value plans. There are some companies such as , and many more. Who provide 99.9% UPTIME Guarantee.Many companies sometime host there servers to those locations which are not much secure but by hosting here will reduce their working and maintaining cost.There is also one more reason to check the server location because few companies having server on few countries then it would be a challenge for your website to rank high in Google search results. I am not saying that your website will not work but you will need to work hard to rank your website. Even if the server is too far then it could affect your website loading speed as well.Let’s understand this with an example like if your hosted server in low income country which is not too secure and also it is too far from your website targeted location. So, your website time could increase and you can lose your traffic.So, always check your hosting server location before buying any web host for your website.If your website having a complex design and having many widgets and other animation then this factor play a very important role while choosing any plan.Because if your webpage is full of widgets and animations then it will results in your high loading time. To overcome this issue your hosting plan should be powerful enough to handle all these things.You can choose dedicated servers for these kind of heavy websites.Bandwidth is basically data transfer rate. It will also help in web page speed like if your data transfer rate is good then page will also open fast.There are few companies which provide limitation on the bandwidth data. So, before buying any hosting deal. You should check Bandwidth data limit.Before choosing any  you should look at their testimonials and customer review. This will help you checking the reputation and quality of that web host.If customers are complaining about that host then it would be helpful for you to take a decision against less reputed host.There are many web hosting companies, which are open and having great reputation in the market. If you don’t give attention to this point then this would cost you in the future.If your web host is trusted, reliable and fast then Google will also trust your website (in my opinion).", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/web-hosting/5-important-factors-before-choosing-any-web-hosting-deal.html"},

The first one, Base Metabolic Rate (BMR) is the amount of calories that your body will burn irregardless what you do, even if you just sleep through without doing anything at all. The second value is the amount of calories you will need daily to go about your daily activities. The difference between these 2 values will be greater the more active your lifestyle is and smallest when only a normal sedentary lifestyle is assumed.Once you know these figures, you know how to target to plan your diet and exercises.Calculate your caloric value at  Now2. Cut out all sugar products.No sugary drinks and fruit juices. Take coffee or tea black. A diet high in sugar will cause insulin resistance, which will then retard your body's ability to burn fat3. Eat freshAvoid high fat high salt processed foods like ham, bacon and hotdogs. Whenever possible, eat food fresh especially lots of green vegetables. My favourite is the lettuce with cherry tomatoes and japanese cucumbers.4. Eat more proteins and carbohydrates from vegetables and less starchy carbs like pastaEat more proteins from chicken breast and salmon. Reduce intake of pasta, rice and starchy sauces.Another good sauce is from nuts, about a handful a day of unsalted nuts like hazelnuts, almonds, cashews would be good.5. 1 hour of cardio workout dailyBe on your exercise bike or threadmill for at least an hour a day. An hour a day will help you burn off 500 calories thereabouts.6. Curb your appetite. Eat only 80% full.A lot of people fall at this hurdle. In the modern world, portions are invariable larger than what our bodies need and we end up eating more than what our body needs and therefore the excess ends up being stored as fat. Over time, our body got used to the larger and larger portions and even when we have eaten more calories than our body needed, we still feel hungry and continue eating. So, starting with eating only 80% full can help to adjust our appetite downwards. This is why point 1 is so important. It is knowing how much our body needed so that we can stop eating even though we have hunger pangs.In the initial stages, you can fill in with fruits like guava which have high dietary fiber and can help you stave off the hunger pangs. After a while, you won't even feel the hunger anymore on the reduced intake. I always make a guava snack which is sliced guava in apple cider vinegar so that i can snack whenever I feel like gorging myself on food.Just make sure that proteins are not sacrificed. Women need a daily dose of 45 grams of protein and Men need 55 grams.7. Pick a high intensity sport to play at least once a weekPick up an interest in sports which you can participate at least once a week. This can help to burn up another few hundred calories per week.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/weight-loss/7-ways-to-lose-weight.html"},
{"heading": "The Mediterranean Diet For Losing Weight", "author": "Mary Melendez", "description": "This article explores the effectiveness of the mediterranean diet for losing weight. It looks into what are the foods eaten and how it promotes weight loss and fat burning. It also highlights how to make it the super effective weight loss program by just making a few minor adjustments to it.", "word-count": 767, "body": "There is a recent interest in the Mediterranean Diet for weight loss. Strictly speaking, it is not so much a diet but a lifestyle of the people of Greece and southern Italy or the coastal areas along the Mediterranean Sea. However, the eating habits of this region was recently recognised as a diet good for heart health and was also noted that it may be beneficial for weight loss. I have therefore doing a review of it here with regards to its effectiveness in weight loss.The lifestyle of the Greeks and Italians is to gather around and dining is more of a social gathering rather than just eating. They consume high amounts of legumes like lentils and broad beans, tubers like radishes, turnips and carrots, green leafy vegetables like lettuce and root vegetable like potatoe, tomatoes and eggplants, nuts and seeds. They also partake a lot of fruits like apricots, peaches, nectarines and cherries, olives and in season figs and grapes too. Oil used is olive oilFishes like fresh sardines and anchovy are also eaten a lot with moderate diary products mainly of cheese and yogurt. The fish are usually grilled and drizzled with lemon juice. Wine consumption is moderate with a very low intake of non-fish meat products like pork, chicken, lamb and beef. Also rarely seen in cuisines of this region are processed foods high in salt and sugar.For staples, pita, either white or whole grain and barley bread is consumed. Now let's see how this eating habit does for your weight loss effortsFirstly, Olive oil is high in healthy monounsaturated fats instead of the unhealthy polyunsaturated and trans fats found in other types of oil.Secondly, studies1 have shown that eating a serving a day (about 130grams) of lentils and broad beans help study subjects lose 0.34 kg over a 6 week period. The Mediterranean cuisines also uses plenty of tomatoes and eggplants. Tomatoes are known to reduce inflammation and water retention and reversing leptin resistance. Leptin is the protein that signals to our brain that we are full and stop eating. Therefore, tomatoes are great to prevent us from overeating and lower our calorie intake. Eggplants are high fiber and low calorie. Its high fiber can lower blood sugar by slowing rate of digestion and absorption of sugar in body. Slower absorption keep blood sugar levels steady.It is also known to increase production of insulin which can lower blood sugar. The high fiber content also helps to keep you full longer resulting in lower calorie consumption.Thirdly, their diet also consist of fresh sardines and anchovy. Each 100g of serving of sardines contains 125 calories, 7g of fat, 20g protein and 0 carbohydrates. Each 1 oz serving of anchovy contributes 37 calories, 1.4g fat and 5.8g protein. Both are rich in omega 3 fatty acids.White pita bread has a Glycemic index of 57, with the whole grain option being lower while the barley bread is even lower at 34.As for the fruits eaten, all are highly beneficial for weight loss. Apricots is low in calories of roughly 48 calories per 100 grams and high fiber. Peaches are also low in calories and boost metabolism as tthey contain flavanoids like catechins and they also have high fiber content. A medium nectarine has 60 calories, 15 g fat and 2g fiber. Sweet and juicy, it provide a source of natural sugar without the need for added sugar. Cherries contain a hormone called melatonin which is what is produced when we are in  that sets our body fat burning into overdrive mode. They are also low in calories and contains vitamins that boost metabolism. Cherries are believed to be one of the most energy boosting fruits.Based on the above observation, all the components seem to be tailored for weight loss. No wonder the recent craze on this diet. Although it was not originally meant as a diet plan, with just a few minor adjustments, it can be turned into a super effective weight loss diet. Some of the changes are for example to skip the pita and just take the barley bread instead, and skip the potatoes. In addition, non-fish meat products should be limited to skinless chicken breast and skip the other meats altogether. With these changes, what your eating plan would bea. Carbohydrates from green leafy vegetables and low to non existent starchy carbohydratesb. Low fat diet mainly from cheese and yogurtc. High protein from the nuts, seeds, sardines and anchovyd. low calorie, high fiber and metabolism boosting fruitse. Moderated consumption of wine which also helpsI would say, you can't go much wrong following the above.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/weight-loss/the-mediterranean-diet-for-losing-weight.html"},

There are many studies that shows that sleeping early burn fat fast.At that time, I was keeping late nights, feeling stressed and downing coffee after coffee. I was also gorging on carbonated soda and potatoe chips. These led me be be listless in the day, drained of energy and always hungry.The wakeup call came, when at the grand old age of 30, I was panting hard after just climbing a short flight of stairs. I was weighing at 75 kg or 165 lbs then. It didn't help that, right around this time, my doctor told me that I am at high risk of getting diabetes. He told me to ease down on the sugar and re-test again in 3 months. He would have to put me on long term medication if there is no improvement.The Simplest Change to my diet and lifestyle that resulted in losing weight and feeling healhierThe first thing I decided to change was to ease down on the late nights and start going to bed early. This reduces my lethargy in the day and I felt less stressed..Once I started sleeping early, I was able to give up all the sugary drinks and high salt snacks that I was consuming.I also started eating less starchy carbohydrates, which actually make me feel less hungry and more energetic. This was when I began exercising more regularly. I went on the treadmill and exercise bike for 30 minutes daily now.Gradually, I began to get back in shape and becoming more energetic. As my body begins to lighten, I found it easier to to reduce my food intake and exercise longer. My endurance began to improve and I don't pant as much going up stairs. I continue pressing in, trying many diets and at the end of 6 months, I felt like a new person.Looking back, I come to recognise that critical to my success was the decision to stop the late nights and going to bed by 10pm. This forms the basis on which all the other initiatives was built upon.Backed by scientific after scientific study, was the fact that sleeping early burn fat fast in the following waysBy Reducing Insulin ResistanceA lack of sleep causes insulin resistance. This causes our inability to break down the sugars and it gets absorbed into our system.By Cutting Cortisol ProductionYour body also produces the stress hormone Cortisol in abundance, which causes us to feel hungry indefinitely. It also induces cravingss for high sugar, high salt food. Your body will also slow down the fat burning process as the brain signals that it is in crisis and need to preserve fat store. This also lead to slowing down of all other bodily function, which explains why we will feel slow and lethargic when we have insufficient sleep.By Producing MelatoninMelatonin production starts to ramp up from 10pm and peaks around 12 midnight, slowly trailing off until 2am. It is our body mechanism to repair all our body systems that was impaired during the day. During this repair process, the body burns up tremendous amount of our fat store.Therefore, if we are not in a deep sleep by 10pm, this natural repair process and hence the tremendous fat burning would be disrupted. to get started and see a brand new you in 2020", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/weight-loss/simplest-change-to-diet-and-lifestyle-that-resulted-in-losing-weight-and-feeling-healthier.html"},

Due to the fact that every human being will face the afterlife one day, this article admnishes everybody to pursue spirituality.", "word-count": 600, "body": "If we take a look at life from God’s position and perspective, we might be pushed to ask ourselves this big question — why are we here on Earth? What was God’s reason for placing us on Earth? Did we get here accidentally? Or, were we intentionally designed with a specific purpose which is different from what we think? Many people and many religions agree that our reason for being here has a unique purpose. One of the major purposes for being here (on Earth), is to locate your own destiny by consistently striving to find out what you were born to do; and then — go all out to fulfill it. By achieving fulfillment and greatness, we’ll certainly be able to contribute our own quota to the welfare and destiny of mankind; and the world at large. Another major purpose for being here — is to continuously develop spiritually as we travel on our everlasting journey of spirituality.Unfortunately, the minds of most people tend to lead them astray, and into a direction which doesn’t come from the bowels of their hearts: this distracts them from finding the true purpose of their lives. Most people often think that money, power, success, fame and popularity will create an eternally happy lifestyle for them, and so they vigorously pursue these desires. Other types of people chase these dreams while simultaneously seeking spiritual development: this is the best option because you’ll be using one stone (life on earth) to kill two birds (your dreams, and spiritual development). The pursuit of spiritual development along with enlightenment about our destiny, would give us a peaceful state of mind, and make us feel more relaxed and calm. Our purpose in life is related to a considerable extent — with seeking spiritual enlightenment about God, his ethics and his kingdom. If our spirits are not sufficiently inspired and motivated, we’ll find it difficult to awaken the perception about our life’s purpose. A major key towards realizing spiritual development and enlightenment, is to follow your intuition – your spiritual thinking – your heart. We have to find out our purpose in life, and live it to the fullest – from deep within our souls. Living our life in this manner will imbibe stillness within our minds; and then, we’ll naturally be able to let go of negative emotions, hopelessness, fear, guilt, malice and false beliefs which normally preoccupy the human mind.If we become successful in making the pursuit of spirituality – a habit, our minds will automatically tune into a greater reality which can help us achieve a stabilized level of spiritual enlightenment and continuous spiritual development. In summary — locate your life’s purpose. If you can succeed in doing so, then you won’t have much to worry about; and you will be contented with everything you have, no matter what position you are in life. Everyone has to learn how to let go of bad memories often associated with the past: don’t harbor them within your minds. In dropping the odds and negatives, our minds will gradually become more still as time passes by. Also, we have to develop a personality that can’t be negatively influenced by the outward (material) changes so often associated with life. In so doing, our minds will become less affected by any change in external situations. Another important thing to do is to rid ourselves of fear(s) associated with a lack of faith. This fear often keeps many people away from moving towards the direction of their destinies. Such negative traits prevent us from believing in God, the spiritual world, and eternity.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/wisdom/in-the-pursuit-of-dreams-along-with-spiritual-development.html"},

Spiritually, a Gregorian calendar doesn’t exist. An invincible determination can achieve almost anything, and in this – lies the distinction between great men and common men.

If you and your family would do the same, you would be put place of honour in your generation. I remembered several years ago when the wife of a pastor committed suicide by hanging herself at their residence. She hanged herself while the husband was attending a night vigil because since they married, they had no child, and she suspected that the husband was falling into temptation, and having sex and children outside their marriage. Is there anything that God cannot do? If the husband was having an extramarital affair, couldn’t God have intervened?We must never judge the dead, but if the problem was due to lack of having a child and she was growing older, is the God of Zechariah, Abraham, Sarah and Job dead? No! Your case is no different! It’s never too late! And it’s time to say that – repeatedly – to all forms of negativity staring at you. Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporal problem. Note that age is not a barrier to achieving God’s plans for your life! Many people are always blaming circumstances for the cause of where they are in life: however, the people who get along in this world are those who get up and look for the circumstance they want, and if they can’t favourable circumstances, they create them.

Don’t expect GOD’s principles to work wonders for you in one area when you violate them in another area, or areas. For example, it doesn’t matter how much principles of faith you operate by, if you violate the principles of righteousness, truthfulness and respect for your fellow man, your faith will never produce strong results (acts). Irrespective of an individuals faith (i.e. your faith or that of someone spiritually higher than you), if sin is on ground – then all your expectations won’t be completely realized. This is the mystery behind so many unanswered prayers! The second example is in the area of financial prosperity: if you are a good giver “sometimes”, but become negligent “at other times”, then true prosperity may likely elude you. In order for this type of scene not to occur, abide by GOD’s laws or principles so you can have a smooth ride on his ways as you watch the multitude (like the Israelites) stare at the acts.In order for everything to be put in proper balance, what should you do? Well, make attempts to do the following: (i) Be open to GOD! Search yourself and find out if there are any of GOD’s principles you are violating. If you are sincere and eager, you will find out the exact thing(s) you are suppose to stop doing. And once you are able to find it out, amend it by “stopping it”; (ii) Since we are all human and prone to making mistakes, ask GOD to give you the grace to overcome the hurdles confronting you in the areas where you’re lagging behind.

These are calories consumed, calories expended and metabolism. The best method of diet to lose weight extremely fast and keep it off is one that helps me turbo boost my metabolism.This is because for the same amount of calorie reduction through lower intake and higher output, a higher metabolism rate can multiply weight loss and fat burn. High metabolism rate also ensures that the weight loss is permanent and does not come back after you go off the aggressive dieting.Besides the diet, I would also touch on the simple exercises that you can do to increase your metabolism and finally the one simple trick to turbo charge your metabolism for maximum weight and fat reduction.The best method of diet to lose weight extremely fast and keep it offNext, we look at what kind of diet that can help to reduce calories and increase metabolism.1. Cut down sugar which increases insulin resistanceSugar increases our insulin resistance which in turn reduces our metabolism and cause our body to store up fat.2. less starchy carbohydratesI would review my base metabolism rate (BMR) regularly for the amount of calories required daily. You can check it out using my  . Consume whatever is your BMR calorie if you are trying to maintain your weight. If you are trying to lose weight, just consume less than your BMR. I usually go for 20-30% less.I would limit the amount of calories taken daily to a maximum of 50% from starchy carbohydrates.During periods when I want to reduce more, i would limit this to 30%. This is so when after festive seasons when I have been eating more than my usual.Starchy carbohydrates increases our sugar levels, so reducing starchy carbohydrates reduces our sugar levels3. Say No to Starchy saucesEven when we eat low calorie food, the starchy sauce sometimes can contribute more calories than the actual food itself So, the next time you have a meal, request for sauce on the side and take it only sparingly.4. Increase intake of proteinAs you reduce starchy carbohydrate, you have to make up for it through more protein like skinless chicken breast or salmon. Protein is known for boosting our metabolism.5. Take more leafy greens like lettuceAnother source to replace the reduced starchy carbohydrates are leafy greens like lettuce which contains carbohydrates without the sugar.6. Tomatoes which reverses leptin resistanceTomatoes are known to reduce inflammation and water retention and reversing leptin resistance. Leptin is the protein that signals to our brain that we are full and stop eating. Therefore, tomatoes are great to prevent us from overeating and lower our calorie intake7. Metabolism boosting food and fruitsPeaches are also low in calories and boost metabolism as they contain flavanoids like catechins and they also have high fiber content.Cherries contain a hormone called melatonin which is what is produced when we are in deep sleep that sets our body fat burning into overdrive mode. They are also low in calories and contains vitamins that boost metabolism. Cherries are believed to be one of the most energy boosting fruits. This is essential while on a diet to counteract the low energy levels experienced due to huge reduction in sugar intake.8. Low GL and high dietary fiber fruitsThis is one of the best way to assuage your hunger pangs as you reduce your intake. One of my favourite is the guava. It has one of the lowest GL and the highest dietary fiber amongst all fruits.You can even make it into a snack by soaking it in apple vinegar. This is so useful when you try to kick your habit of snacking on high sugar high salt snacks.Exercises to burn calories and up metabolismOne simple exercise which you can do anywhere is the sprint. You can burn up tremendous calories doing this simple exercise.Swimming is another great exercise which I prefer to burn off calories.Both are great for boosting your metabolism.How to Turbo Charge Our Metabolism and turn it into a weight and fat burnerFirstly, we need to know how metabolism is affected. The main component that drives metabolism is the production of Melatonin. Melatonin is produced when we go to sleep and is produced in the dark. Pressence of light inhibits Melatonin production.Based on our biological clock or the circadian rhythm, melatonin production starts at 10pm when we are fast asleep in the the dark. It will ramp up to the maximum at 12 midnight after which it will start falling until by 2am, production ceases.This is our body natural response and during this time, when melatonin is produced, our metabolism is highest as the body burns up tremendous energy in order to repair our cells that was damaged in our daytime activities.Therefore, you need to be asleep by 10pm for this turbo charged calorie and fat burning machine to begin working miracles for your body.However, if you do not have sufficient sleep, more of the stress hormone Cortisol would be produced. You will find that this would slow down your metabolism. Not only that, you would start craving for high sugar, high salt food and cause hunger pangs. Hence, it is imperative that you have to reduce stress and have adequate rest to maximise weight loss.Therefore, the best method of diet to lose weight extremely fast and keep it off is to  your metabolism. So, get into deep sleep mode by 10pm today!", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/weight-loss/the-best-method-of-diet-to-lose-weight-extremely-fast-and-keep-it-off.html"},

{"heading": "Do It in the Morning and Lose Weight Fast", "author": "Chie Sanjo", "description": "Want to know the fastest way to lose weight? The article talks about the most effective time of the day to lose weight and simple tips to start the program!", "word-count": 740, "body": "Burn Fat in the Morning and Accelerated your Weight Loss Velocity!Morning weight loss program? You may be thinking, 'I'm busy in the morning…' but if it only takes 10 minutes to make you lose weight, would you be interested? Exercise is essential for getting the body you want and there are indeed certain times of the day that are more suitable for workouts. So, let's talk about the most efficient way to lose weight. Here are some benefits and tips for the best time of the day to take exercise and how to improve its efficiency. 3 Benefits of Morning Workouts 1. Increased MetabolismOne of the benefits of exercising in the morning is an increase in metabolism, and this is related to the autonomic nervous system. Fat is burned at any time of the day, but it is particularly easy to burn when the sympathetic nervous system is active. When you relax, the parasympathetic nerves are dominant, but in the daytime, the sympathetic nerves become dominant and your body temperature goes up. You can accelerate this activity by exercising in the morning, and your basal metabolism is increased by 10%. 2. Regulates your Lifestyle and Feel BetterThe sympathetic nerves become dominant through morning activities, which switches the body into daytime mode. Once the body awakens, serotonin, known as happy hormones, gets released and you will be able to greet a crisp morning. The brain also goes into an active mode which regulates the body rhythm and spreads more serotonin, making the mind even healthier. You will be able to spend a refreshing day and improve your work efficiency. 3. Easier to Burn FatThe energy used in activities is generally consumed in the order of carbohydrates to fat. However, the food you eat is digested while you sleep at night, and in the morning, you wake up with a hungry body with low blood sugar levels, and you automatically use fat as a source of energy. Therefore, if you exercise at that time, fat is easily burned.Exercising on an empty stomach right after waking up can hurt your body, so drink a glass of water first and preferably take a light sip of something easily digestible such as a banana or a jelly before you do it. Also, remember to hydrate frequently during your workout. How to Start a Morning Wight Loss Program? 1. Get up 20 minutes earlier than usual.One hour or two in the morning sounds like a high wall, so let's start by waking up 20~30 minutes early. 2. Drink a glass of warm water.When you wake up, drink a glass of warm water to rehydrate your body. Avoid taking cold or pungent drinks first thing in the morning, as they may overstimulate your stomach. The key to drinking is to take it in small sips, little by little. Let the water soak into your body slowly. 3. Eat fruit.When time is short in the morning, you tend to eat quick bread or leave the house without any food, right? The fruit is one of the recommended options you can eat as your breakfast. The enzymes in the fruit will promote elimination which helps your body to metabolize better. Fruit also contains the right amount of sugar, vitamins, and minerals that the body can easily absorb and it keeps you hydrated. 4. Stretch your body.When you just wake up from your deep sleep, your body is not yet awake and is lacking in water and energy. Strenuous exercise in this state can be overloading on the body, so start by stretching your body which is not too painful to get yourself out of bed to turn on your body switch. Activating your body in the morning is also a great way to boost your metabolism, and the benefits are endless. 5. Take simple workouts.Once you complete the stretching sequence and your body turns into an active mode, some easy strength training you can do at home such as squats and tiptoe lift will be the next step. Stimulating the lower body muscles can reduce swelling and firm the entire body. Start from 5~10 times each day if you do not take a regular based exercise.  in the early morning may be hard at first, but you will soon begin to enjoy it once you get used to it. Morning workouts are one of the most effective ways to lose weight fast.

Mindfulness is a form of meditation that originated from Japanese Zen and is often described as the body condition filled with the mind. The article dives into the topic from Zen aspects and introduces simple steps to start it.", "word-count": 984, "body": "History of Mindful EatingMindful eating is a diet method based on mindfulness. It is recently attracting people all over the world for its ability to lose weight and keep it off easily. Also known as 'eating meditation,' it allows you to focus your mind on eating and the food you are taking which, as a result, bring a variety of benefits including stress relief and work efficiency improvement.Japanese Zen, which is originated from the Buddhist philosophy, means 'to calm the mind and not to be upset.' Mindfulness is one of the practices derived from Zen and is a form of meditation developed in Western countries. Often described as 'the body condition filled with mind,' it is widely adopted in medical, educational, and business fields as a stress management method. By closing your eyes and breathing deeply, you can become fully present and aware of your physical and emotional state. It is also called 'mind exercise' as it aims to improve self-control ability by focusing on settling the mind to where the body belongs and enjoying the present moment.The Importance of Using the Five SensesIn the modern world, we are used to getting distracted by TV and cell phones during our meals. When we are busy at work, many of us just bite into a sandwich while staring at the computer to fill our stomachs. Such 'eating while…' leads to overeating and cravings for sweets, as you no longer feel satisfied with your food. The euphoria of taking food is also diminished, which can cause an unfulfillment feeling and daily emptiness.Food should be savored with all five basic senses of the human body. In the old days when food was precious, we all did it so naturally. Mindful eating reminds us of a sense of well-being with less and appreciation for food, that we used to have in these old days.5 Benefits of Mindful EatingIn mindful eating, you use all five basic senses to eat. Enjoy your meal with sights and smells. Chew and savor each bite well so that you get a full euphoria over what you are taking. Mindful eating does not require a large meal as it maximizes your satisfaction with fewer foods than you usually take which, as a result, prevents overeating and excess of calorie intake. Besides, as you continue, your taste buds become more sensitive and you start to avoid strong-flavored foods and junk food which are usually higher in calories.Improved eating habits alleviates stress. If you are always busy and messed up in your head, forget about all the work during mealtime. Making the distinctive switch between work and meals improves your work efficiency and relieve stress.7 Steps for Mindful Eating PracticeStep 1. Locate yourself in a dining environment.Avoid eating at your work desk or on the couch and always sit at the dining table. The dining table should be kept clean with no distractions such as papers and magazines.Step 2. Turn off all information devices and get away from the phone.Don't look at the TV or your cell phone and just concentrate on your meal. Staring at your phone until right before your meal gets served is not conducive to mindful eating. Get away from external information and clear your mind. It is fine to have a conversation with your companions, but don't get too caught up in the chat. You may end up neglecting the meal.Step 3. Enjoy the meal with the five senses.After the meal is served in front of you, take a good look at it, and observe it visually first. Then, smell it carefully to enjoy its aroma. You don't have to spend a long time on it. 10-20 seconds will be enough to send your brain the command 'I am going to eat something that looks great.'Step 4. Take a few minutes for appreciation.Take a few minutes to appreciate the food before start eating. Be respectful of all the plants, animals, and people involved in that meal. Being grateful and striving to feel happy will help your body and mind to receive the nutrition more smoothly.Step 5. Chew well.Chew your meals well, one bite at a time. This stimulates the satiety center and satisfies you with smaller amounts of food. After taking a bite in your mouth, roll it around on your tongue, and feel the texture.Step 6. Feeling the deliciousness.If you concentrate on what you are eating, you will become much more sensitive to the taste of your food. Enjoy the different tastes of each piece of your meal, such as sweet or bitter, soft or crunchy.Step 7. Once you get a full stomach, finish the meal.In mindful eating, it is important to observe not only your diet but also your physical condition. As you get used to it, you begin to feel changes in the way your body acts while you eat. Finish your meal when you feel full. You will find a reduction in the amount of food you take until you become satisfied.Apply Mindful Eating at Dessert Time!Sweets are the worst enemy for weight loss! We all know, but sometimes we cannot help craving it, can we? Dessert time is another perfect moment to apply mindful eating. Follow the same steps and concentrate on the sweet treat in front of you, savor it, and you'll be more satisfied with a smaller portion.We Are What We EatWe are made up of what we eat. What we eat is an essential factor that not only affects our health and beauty but also has a great impact on our state of mind. By adopting mindful eating, you can reevaluate the quantity and quality of your diet without painful restrictions. As you continue, it blends into your lifestyle and you begin to lose weight and keep it off gradually. Eating correctly can be more important to weight loss than exercise.

It is an extremely low fat, low calorie, and high protein diet suitable for people of all ages. In this article, the author discusses a perfect Japanese meal plan for weight loss from various viewpoints.", "word-count": 943, "body": "The Healthiest Diet to Lose WeightIf you want to lose weight healthily and keep it off, then a Japanese diet is the way to go. Aiming simply to lose weight despite the method you use leads to rebounding and ends up being ineffective. If you are serious about losing weight, you should make a long-term plan which gets your body in shape in a healthy way. Japanese food is one of the effective diets you can follow and has recently become a worldwide phenomenon. It is the healthiest meal plan for weight loss with an extremely high success rate. Japanese Food as a World HeritageIn December 2013, Japanese food has been listed as an intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization). Particularly acclaimed was the excellent nutritional balance of fresh foods with a wide variety of ingredients and its ability to express the changing of the four seasons.If you look at the world's healthiest country ranking by WHO (World Health Organization), Japan has ranked in the top 5 for the last 50 years! Being extremely low fat, low calorie, and high protein, changing your daily diet to a Japanese style will bring a positive effect on your body. 5 Benefits of Eating Japanese Food 1. Successful Weight ReductionThe first thing to keep in mind when making a weight loss program is calorie intake. A traditional Japanese meal set which consists of rice, miso soup, and dishes such as grilled fish, boiled vegetables, seaweed, and soybeans is low in calories and high in protein, yet still satisfying. It is a whole-foods-based diet with minimal amounts of animal protein, added sugars, and fat, so you can avoid high-calorie, processed foods. 2. Relieve ConstipationJapanese diet generally contains a sufficient amount of vegetables and is rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Fiber is particularly an important nutrient for dieters as it helps regulate the intestinal environment. Japanese food is a weight-loss-friendly meal as you can consciously consume these essential nutrients without being aware of it. 3. Prevent Lifestyle DiseasesToo much fat intake can lead to excessive consumption of saturated fatty acids such as meat and butter. If you continue this eating habit, your cholesterol levels and triglycerides will eventually rise. Cholesterol and triglycerides interfere with smooth blood flow and make the bloodthirsty, which causes a variety of diseases including arteriosclerosis, so you must take an early improvement. This is where the Japanese diet rich in fish and seafood comes in as a countermeasure.Seafood, especially bluefish, is high in unsaturated fatty acids and activates brain cells due to its high levels of DHA, in addition to thinning the blood. Not only does it prevent the intake of too much fat, but it also works on other organs while supplying protein, so be sure to include it in your menu. 4. Improve Dental ProblemsSugar and processed foods can cause tooth decay. Japanese cuisine which focuses on raw and crunchy foods encourages the behavior of chewing. Chewing food is an important activity that helps your body produce saliva to aid in digestion and promote tooth and bone development. Chewing also stimulates your satiety center which helps you feel satisfied at an earlier stage of your meal, and as a result, you won't overeat more than you need to. 5. Nutritious and Balanced Diet for Beautiful SkinJapanese food contains a large number of ingredients and is a great source of fiber, minerals, and vitamins. Adding a side dish to your daily diet, especially one with plenty of vegetables, will balance your nutrition without strain. Keep an eye on your nutritional balance to maintain your skin condition and your health. How to Start the Japanese Diet?If you are newcomers, switching all your meals to Japanese style won't be easy, so start with replacing one of your daily meals with Japanese food. The Basis of the Japanese Diet '1 Soup + 3 Dishes'The basis of a Japanese diet is a balance of one soup and three dishes. 3 Tips for '1 Soup + 3 Dishes' 1. Be Efficient in Meal Prep and Last LongOne main dish and two side dishes may seem like a lot of work. When you're short on time, choose a simple menu such as grilled fish as the main dish. You can use commercial products such as tofu or seaweed for side dishes, or a salad with raw vegetables can be an alternative. If you are not comfortable making side dishes every day, prepare them in advance or use the freezing technique. 2. Use Low-Calorie IngredientsAn advantage of the Japanese diet is bulking low-calorie foods that increase the volume of your meals. Try to include , , and mushrooms which are all low in calories. For example, incorporate mushroom soup and tofu side dishes, as well as miso soup with lots of vegetables. 3. Avoid Deep-Fried Foods for DinnerIt will be better if you keep a balance of three daily meals. Breakfast acts as a source of energy. Even if you eat high-calorie foods in the morning, they are less likely to turn into fat because of the long period of activity that follows. On the other hand, try to avoid fried foods and take a light meal for dinner. You can cut down on calories by selecting raw or boiled ingredients rather than fried or stir-fried foods. Get Your Health and Weight Loss Fixed with Japanese DietJapanese food is an easy way to start a healthy diet that doesn't require a sudden decrease in quantity or food bias. If your weight reduction has been unsuccessful in the past, why don't you try this delicious and healthy Japanese meal plan for weight loss?", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/weight-loss/the-most-effective-meal-plan-for-weight-loss-japanese-diet.html"},

In a few of his speeches, he has even mentioned that sometimes, people even get distracted by success and they fail to understand that success is not permanent. As long as they are successful, they are satisfied, and the moment they see failures, they lost all hopes. This should not happen, as success is all about learning and growing. No matter how many times you fulfill your goal, you should never stop setting newer goals for yourself to achieve greater heights of success. And, when it comes to the real meaning of success, it is much more than just making money. It is more about achieving a certain level of knowledge, reaching a certain place, but still not being hesitant to keep moving, learning and trying new things. Bill Gates is an outstanding entrepreneur and a fantastic individual. He kept reaching newer heights of success, but still, he never ignored the importance of being compassionate towards the people in need.

But give it some time. Let me get settled on the other side.” Several months later, contact was made – but not in the way Jack might have planned it.Sandra and Jack had been best friends since elementary school. Though they went to different universities, they kept in touch by telephone, through greeting cards and, later, email. After graduation, both returned to Toronto. Sandra introduced Jack to Victoria, his wife, and the couple attended Sandra and Leo’s wedding. As Sandra and Jack lived into their 50’s, both became spiritual in their own ways – Sandra grew closer to her church, and Jack embraced Buddhism. The idea of the eternal soul intrigued him.Moving forward several years, Jack was diagnosed with liver cancer, which quickly metastasized through his body. He entered a hospice, and Sandra visited him often. They talked about their feelings of the afterlife, and Jack confessed that he’d once seen a medium. The experience had been quite profound, as the medium had connected him with his parents who’d passed when Jack was a teenager. This was a great comfort, and made him more firmly believe in the continuous existence of the soul.Jack’s funeral was packed. Sandra’s husband consoled her, and they talked about the times the two couples had gotten together to see a movie, or celebrate New Year’s Eve or an anniversary. When Sandra’s third grandchild was born, they named him Jack. And as time crept on, Sandra thought less and less of her dear friend.One night, Sandra woke from a deep sleep with Jack on her mind. He seemed so close, it felt like he was in the room with her. She said his name, almost expecting him to answer. Find my medium, she thought he had said.Giving in to her curiosity, she Googled “Toronto medium” and now Sandra was on the phone. “I think Jack was sending me a message, she said. “I remember him telling me once that he went to you for a reading.” She paused a moment, then slowly shook her head. “Honestly, I’m not even sure that Jack has the ability to enter my dreams.”“Let me explain something called ‘visitations’” I said. “When we’re asleep, we’re open to visits from the spirit world, especially loved ones who want to touch in with us. It’s easier for them to enter our subconscious mind because we’re more receptive, more at peace. So, let’s see if I can connect with Jack and see what he wants.”While I didn’t recall reading for Jack – I see hundreds of clients every year – I concentrated on the picture of Jack that Sandra had sent me. I felt a broad-shouldered man with a Welsh connection step forward. He was holding a lotus and pointing to his robe and sandals. Sandra confirmed that Jack’s parents were from Wales, and he was a Buddhist who believed that in a past life, he’d worn the saffron-coloured robe of a monk.“He wants to tell you he’s fine and, yes, the soul does live on after the transition we call death,” I said. Then Jack said a few personal things for Sandra to end the session on an empowering note.Afterward, I felt light-headed and amazed. “This is the first time that I’ve read for a client in the flesh, and then contacted him in the spirit world,” I said. “And now that Jack knows you’re open to spirit contact, talk to him whenever you’d like – even when you’re wide awake.”", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/wisdom/please-find-my-medium.html"},

Some concerns include identifying which principles are conflicting, what consequences the actions taken have, and what are the bases of the case and the opposing ideologies among others. It is the responsibility of the manager to ensure that all the employees are handled justly and equally.More Read: Considering that ABC Global accommodates all religions regardless of how the employees practice or express them, and also there are rules and regulations under the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission (EEOC), the case must be dealt with ethically to ensure that neither side has been overlooked. Evidently, the issue of religious accommodation in the organization potentially affects the performance of some employees because they are uncomfortable when around those who practice different beliefs. As an employer, one can develop and implement specific measures and policies that will ensure that the morale of operation within the organization is not affected and the workers can interact freely with each other. Some strategies include limiting those who conduct prayers or read religious books to specific places where they don’t create undue hardships on others. Also, regulation of the employees’ religious dressing and grooming is an essential element that can be developed (Accommodating). However, these regulations should not be created and implemented regarding assumed undue hardships. After development, religious accommodation programs can be introduced to advise, educate, and handle the employees on issues regarding their ethical beliefs in the workplace. Hence, the workers might adapt and transform their perception of others in the same organization.Works Cited“Accommodating Religion, Belief, And Spirituality In The Workplace”. SHRM, 2018,Guillory, William A. Spirituality in the workplace.

{"heading": "The Cause and Prevention to Stop Hair Fall", "author": "Shikha Viswas", "description": "Hair fall could be a nightmare for most of the people. Check out this article to know the causes and what you can do to stop hair fall.", "word-count": 996, "body": "Hair is the fastest growing tissue in the body, made up of proteins called keratins. Each strand of hair is made up of three layers: the inner layer or the medulla (only found in thick hair); the middle layer or cortex, which determines the strength, texture, and color of the hair; and the cuticle, which protects the cortex.Although both men and women may suffer from significant hair loss, more than 50% of men will suffer from male pattern baldness (BPD), also known as androgenic alopecia, at some point in their lives. The reason behind hair loss is a genetically inherited sensitivity to Di hydro-testosterone (DHT) and 5-alpha-reductase. The 5-alpha-reductase enzyme converts testosterone, a male hormone, into DHT, the substance identified as the end cause for hair loss.Hair loss has been noticed and studied through the ages, and some interesting discoveries were made in ancient times. On the one hand, it was noticed that eunuchs: those males without genitals-never went bald. Men who have been castrated as a result of combat accidents have never gone bald. It has also been found that the more recessive hair gene, the more propensity for baldness has. People with blond hair have a greater propensity for hair loss than people with darker hairMyths about the Hair LossSome common myths have arisen about hair loss. Due to medical advances many of these myths are addressed and corrected. For starters, the pattern baldness is genetic and therefore may be hereditary; it is not transmitted by only your mother's side of the family. On either side of the family can transmit the genetic disposition towards baldness. In addition, unlike old family tales, wearing hats does not cause baldness either.The most common hair loss comes under what has been commonly known as male pattern baldness (MPB). Although called MPB, females suffer from a similar syndrome, so it is more correctly called androgenetic alopecia. Although hair loss is not fatal or endangering health, it can cause serious problems with the psyche and self-Trust. There has been no absolute cure found for hair loss, and many factors of hair loss are hereditary, but there are several preventive measures that can be taken to keep hair healthy and scalpHealthy Food, Diet &amp; Nutrition A key factor in maintaining a growing protein on a part of its biological body is: it is necessary to maintain a healthy diet. Although some factors have been definitively identified as contributors to hair loss, we must keep in mind that hair is part of the entire biological system of the human body. Being a system, malfunctions in one part of the system can contribute to malfunctions in other parts;To define exactly what a healthy diet is when it comes to preventing hair loss can be a little more complex. Mainly, the main vitamins, minerals, and nutrients that must be ingested in one form or another to maintain healthy hair are vitamin A, all B vitamins, especially vitamins B-6 and B-12, folic acid, biotin, vitamin C, vitamin E, copper, iron, zinc, iodine, protein, silica, essential fatty acids (EFA, formerly known as vitamin F) and should not consume water. There are also certain foods that can cause dysfunctions that will contribute to hair loss.The best way to maintain a healthy intake of vitamins and minerals is a good diet. It is not necessary or advisable to go out and buy a bunch of over-the-counter vitamin supplements to achieve your suggested nutritional levels. Many over-the-counter vitamins are chemically treated and are not completely absorbed into the system. It is also easy to overdose with over the counter vitamins, especially when taking vitamin supplements and fat-soluble minerals, causing toxicity and adverse reactions. The probability of doing so is much less with food; therefore, it is always best to get most of your vitamin and mineral needs from whole foods.Juice is a natural way to get many of the vitamins, minerals, and trace elements mentioned above. When using organic fruits and vegetables, juice can provide quite a boost to the system and encourage healthy hair. Juices are very easily assimilated by the body and provide the same content as all food. Fresh juices have high enzyme content, which is beneficial because these enzymes are stored by the body and can be used by the body when cooked food that has been stolen from enzymes is consumed. Storing juice or buying pasteurized juice in the store diminishes this benefit, although the benefits of minerals and vitamins are generally still available. All the fruits and vegetables mentioned above can be juiced to get the maximum benefits from themFood to AvoidThere are a number of foods and substances to avoid and limit consumption. Substances such as alcohol, caffeine, sugar and catch nutrients and increase adrenal levels, causing a chain reaction to produce more androgens and use hair loss High edit and high cholesterol foods are also linked to increased levels of DHT and their consumption should be limited. In addition, common table salt has been linked to hair loss, the average diet recommends the intake of sodium; therefore, salt should never be added to food. However, when using salt for seasoning during cooking, be sure to use salt with iodine being that it is a nutrient that is essential for hair growth as well, unless you are a regular seafood consumer, which contains high levels of iodine.ConclusionAlthough hair loss can be caused by many other variables, lack of proper nutrition will definitely cause hair loss in many people. Fortunately, adopting an appropriate diet that includes the above nutrients can reverse hair loss caused by malnutrition. One thing is certain regardless of whether your hair loss was caused by malnutrition or not, adopting a healthier diet will help the function of other areas of the body, so in the article above we have covered the causes and myths of hair loss including the list of nutritious food to add in your diet and the food to avoid to prevent the hair loss.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/womens-issues/the-cause-and-prevention-to-stop-hair-fall.html"},

On the other hand, you should not become overly conscious of your hairstyle. The styling of your hair should be in line with your poise, stature, and body movements. It should be comfortable and not prove to be a hindrance or nightmare while you get on with your work. This all will help you carry off your hairstyle gracefully.The choice of a hairstyle rests mainly with you. Since you and your hairstyle would be an intrinsic part of each other, you should choose a hairstyle you like and find it simple to gel with your preferences. It should be practical so that you can manage your hair easily. Another important part of your hairstyle is that it should be in your budget and not very expensive. Spending too much money on a specific hairdo does not prove very practical; rather spending a nominal amount keeps you happy with your looks and your wallet budget as well. A good hairstyle should not be too exaggerated and it is like you can carry it easily and should have very little maintenance costs. The most important thing to be considered while choosing your hairstyle is the shape cut of your face. Face shapes could be square, round, oval, heart-shaped, diamond-shaped, or many others. Oval and heart-shaped faces prove to be the perfect ones that match with a good hairstyle. An equally important factor that decides your hairstyle is the length, texture, curl or straight and the most important one the quality of your hairIf you are having a round face, you are not supposed to cut your hair too short. This emphasizes the roundness of your face and makes your face look very broader. Instead of this go for short and blunt haircuts for your round face.

A long face looks much better with long and loose hair.A wavy hairstyle with curly hair best suited on a square face, you could experiment by wearing curls or waves rounding off as angles around the outer edges of your face. If your face is triangular, your hairstyle should keep away your hair from your face at your temples and forehead while you could wear small curls at your jaws, it will look much decent and elegant. Short or medium hairstyles best suit at rectangular faces. Oval and diamond-shaped faces look beautiful and gorgeous with short, medium, or long hairstyles.If you are having long and thick locks, you can experiment and wear it in any form you choose that you are comfortable with can easily carry. If your hair is of medium or thick in texture, styling and maintaining hair is essential to adapt to any style. You can also use your hair as an important accessory as far as your looks are a concern. If you have very fine hair by nature, it may not gel well or suit with a long and narrow face, Short hairdos suit all types of hair texture. You can create different hairstyles and looks with wavy, fine, curly, or straight hair.Hair partings you can also add to your hairstyle. A straight parting hair at the center adds width to your brow. Side or off-center parting hairs make you appear narrower. The fullness of your hairstyle reflects very much on your looks. The Fullness at your jaw-line broadens of your lower face while fullness at the crown makes your face look longer and accentuates your cheeks and brow: the full hair brushed away from your face pops up to your cheekbones and makes your eyes look wider than normal. Small ringlets, curls, of hair can soften your look as well as hairstyle and reduce the sternness of a pulled-up hairstyle.The Longhair offers the maximum leverage for trying out the different hairstyles and looks.

Luisant Hair extensions can be curled, straightened, blow-dried, and styled just like your own hair. To preserve and, however, We highly recommend suggest the use of a heat protectant spray before styling your set, to extend the lifespan of your Luisant Hair extensions. And just like for your own hair, it's best to use a low heat setting of 120C/250F, as anything higher could damage the hair.The reason why we recommend opting for a lower heat setting is that it will prolong the lifespan of your set. While our own hair may be able to handle a high heat setting, our hair is also constantly getting revitalized from the scalp, whereas hair extensions don't get that sort of constant nutrition.We use very high quality 100% human Remy hair because of which if our extensions are taken good care of, they will last from up to six months to a year. To get maximum use out of your Luisant Hair extensions, please ensure that you always use a heat protectant when styling them and that you do not wash them frequently. Luisant Hair extensions need to be washed only after 30 years. Please ensure that you use a conditioner after shampooing them.You absolutely can! All our extensions are made of 100% Remy hair, which is considered to be the finest quality of human hair. This is because the cuticles are kept intact unlike in most other non-Remy hair extensions. For best results, we recommend that you have our extensions colored by a professional hair colorist. If you’re doing it yourself at home, please ensure that you are using the right products, and do a strand test to make sure you have the right colorFor best results, your hair should be at least 6-7 inches (this is around shoulder length) so that clip-in hair extensions can blend in naturally. With shorter, there is always the risk of the wefts showing through.   Length   Volume    Colour    No Damage    Style     Ease of UseLuisant Hair extensions are made of 100% natural Remy hair, and therefore, just like your own hair, they may get entangled as long hair does. A good way to maintain your clip-ins is by brushing/combing them with a wide-toothed comb before and after use, as well as during use if you feel the need to.As with your own hair, it is best to brush the hair from bottom to top and gently loosen and smoothen any tangles as you go along. The most common reason is that the extensions are putting too much tension on your scalp. To avoid this, do not put too much weight on a small strand of hair. Also, make sure that your hair does not get pulled against its natural growth direction.Since in our clip-in and tape-in extensions the weight of the hair is spread out over a larger area, it does not cause damage to the hair We recommend to clip in the clip-in extensions in a different place each time so as not to put too much stress on the same strands of hair.We use Remy hair in all our extensions. As long as the color of the extensions matches or compliments your natural hair color and a professional stylist applies it properly, no one will be able to tell.It depends on what kind of extensions you have. We recommend that you take off your clip-in extensions before hitting the gym, but you don't have to worry if you have tape-ins. We recommend that you wait for 24-48 hours after you get your tape-ins applied before you either wash your hair or do any work that involves excessive sweating.Keep your scalp healthy:A healthy and nourished scalp will automatically lead to a good head of hair.

Which is why you should follow the right tips when you intend on investing in new swimwear for the next season or even if you need one right now.", "word-count": 664, "body": "You could just pick the bathing suit that you like the most, while being worn by a model that you see on the right website or in a magazine. However, when you do this, there is a pretty good chance that you will regret your choice because you have not considered the most important aspect of this purchase – your own body. You must learn exactly which parts you prefer hiding and the ones you would like to emphasize – this can be hard when wearing a swim suit.Why buy more than one dd swimwear?Even though you might be convinced that just one of these  will be more than enough for the entire season, you should know that this might not be the case. As days pass by, you will realize that you need a new look, which can be easily achieved when you get two different swim suits and have the option to mix and match the tops and bottoms as you desire.Here are a few of the reasons why getting two or more swimwear products is a great idea:• You don’t get bored by having the same outfit every single day. Of course, if you prefer having even more options, it would be a good idea to get different styles. This means that you should be looking at a classic bikini, a one-piece suit and so on.• If one of your bathing suits gets ruined, you have another one to replace it in handy. It’s easier when you already have another suit in your suitcase rather than going to the store to buy a new one.• If you want to go to the beach again in an hour or so and your swim suit is not dry, you can replace it with one of the other options you have brought with you.No one is forcing you to get more than one piece of swimwear. However, when it comes to dd swimwear, you will realize that they look so good, it will be difficult to pick just one. Maybe you could get two or more, try them on and the ones that you don’t like so much, you can easily return to the store. This is a case in which an online store will come in handy.How to find proper swimwear Although you might be convinced that all  will look amazing on you, you should know that you might be setting yourself up for disappointment. As a matter of fact, even if you have the body of a model, you should know that only a few of the available styles will compliment your appearance. This is just the way it works.It should all begin with learning exactly what specific styles would look great on you. There are a few options in this case – you could go to a regular store and try a few different styles on just for research purposes or you could find a website that can offer you a personal stylist. This way, you can get personalized recommendations based on your appearance as well as your preferences. It is all a matter of finding the right provider before you actually order any swimming suits. Take the time to learn more about your options so that you can make the best choice for your summer holiday.Online stores are better even when it comes to dd cup swimwear because you don’t have to get out of the house to buy a top notch product at just the right price. However, you have to do some research before you place an order. Make sure that you come across a store that has been in business for some time now and that can offer you the best possible shopping experience. It might take you a bit of time to find the right provider of bathing suits, but you can be certain that it is completely worth it.

So, if you want to fully optimise your website and improve your ranking, listen up.There are many factors that make a website great, both in terms of design and ranking, and one of the biggest is speed. Nobody, including Google, likes a slow website. In fact, 40% of users will abandon your site if it takes too long to load. Possible even worse than that is the fact that around 80% of shoppers who are unhappy about your site's performance are less likely to buy from you again. Why Does Your Ranking Suck?You've heard of Google algorithms, right? That's the process Google uses to rank websites. And speed is factored into that equation. So here's the thing, you've created a knockout WordPress website, full of great content and suitable keywords, but your ranking sucks. Why?Despite being a great platform for your website, WordPress does have one weakness, and that's speed. But before you throw up your hands in despair, there is a solution. In fact, there are several ways in which you can speed things up, so you not only have a great looking website, but one that is performing efficiently, too.Avoid Cheap Web HostingBelieve it or not, the biggest cause of WordPress's slow speed is also the easiest to fix. Hosting. Sadly, many people get sucked in by cheap web hosting services, not understanding that it will probably cost them more in the long run. Cheap hosting usually means shared hosting, and that will result in extremely slow speeds, frequent crashing and even security issues.I suggest changing to a new web hosting provider, who has a 99.9% Uptime Guarantee - it's really not that expensive.Another reason your WordPress site may be slow is because your images are too big. Most web development services will suggest compressing your images, so that they will load quicker, without compromising on size or quality.Ask An ExpertIf you chose WordPress because you're a blogger, but you're now finding it's frustratingly slow, it could be that you need a Content Delivery Network - or CDN.  use CDN to hold all the static files on your site, so that they can be downloaded really fast.This really should be part of your site from the get-go. But that doesn't mean you should load up your site with every plugin on the market! Another secret to owning a fast and fantastic WordPress site is the 'framework' you choose. Remember, the more you load on, the slower it will be, so avoid the temptation to add all the bells and whistles!Having said that, though, one plugin I would recommend to speed up your site is a caching plugin. Basically, caching works by enabling some parts of your website to load once, instead of every time someone visits your site. This is really good is a user is visiting several pages on your website.These are just some of the ways in which you can speed up your WordPress website. If you're serious about improving the performance of your site, I would highly recommend enlisting the help of website development professionals on the Sunshine Coast.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/webmasters/how-web-development-services-can-boost-your-wordpress-website.html"},

Then again, your site could have ranked organically, without much beginning thought to it’s structure, and has now turned into a scattered and elusive chaos of pages. In any case, on the off chance that you give some cautious thought to your structure as you develop, it could turn into a basic piece of your SEO success.5 steps to create SEO friendly website structure:1.Plan Site Hierarchy:The most basic hierarchy structure is to have the most essential search ranking pages at the top, and to channel down to the less vital pages. There are pages that will be a special case to this, and these pages will be unavoidable so that exploring around your site will be clear and straightforward, yet this is the general guideline.See More:It is imperative to design your site hierarchy before constructing your site, so that your pages don’t turn into a scattered chaos.

This is simple for the crawlers to peruse and simple for your clients to explore.See More:3.Website Depth Should Be Low:Another key component of your structure is to have a shallow site. This means, each page on your site can be open inside a couple of clicks of your landing page. For good SEO, you ought to hope to make your site 3-clicks profound or less. It becomes easy for your site to be crawled, and the less demanding the crawl-ability, the simpler Google can locate your content and rank it.The other purpose behind a shallow site is for a decent User Experience. On the off chance that a client is experiencing issues finding the data they need, then they can without much of a stretch get disappointed and proceed to some other site. Also, as we probably am aware, a high ricochet or bounce rate implies terrible SEO.4.:In spite of the fact that making a low depth site is a decent technique, this can be troublesome, particularly for a huge site with many pages. Grouping your pages into a constrained measure of classes can be unimaginable, or simply doesn’t bode well. This is the place where internal linking can offer assistance.An internal link is an inner association between two pages on the same site, and they have various focal points that are useful for SEO. The first is that they give a valuable approach to explore through your site, which decreases the quantity of clicks expected to navigate to any page on your site. Considering those crawlers adore a low profundity site, Google cherishes it. This, once more, makes a superior client experience for our visitors.The other primary point of interest is that it gives a chance to utilize keyword anchor text.5.Associate SEO Weight and Site Navigation:The Site Navigation is frequently just seen as an apparatus to explore around a site, however truth be told it can be utilized as an instrument to give SEO weight to your favored pages.See More:What we have to recall about the links that navigate is that, they are indeed internal links, as they link to different site pages on the same site. Our internal links function in the same way to external links – the more connections that point towards a specific site page, the more significance that search engines will give that page. In the event that a specific site page is on the navigation,this implies EVERY page on the site has an internal link guiding towards it. This tells search engine tools that, this is a critical page on your site, and this is a page that ought to rank.Your site all in all will have a specific measure of domain authority. On the off chance that you have an individual page on your navigation, then a more noteworthy bit of the site’s authority – or SEO weight – will be given to this page.

Especially if you don’t have any experience with the concept of cracking alkanes. However, we will try our best to explain. Cracking is the name given to breaking up big hydrocarbon molecules into smaller and extra useful bits. This is performed with the aid of the usage of excessive pressures and temperatures without a catalyst or lower temperatures and pressures inside the presence of a catalyst. These fractions are acquired from the distillation technique as drinks but are re-vaporized earlier than cracking.Something that you need to understand is that there isn't any single precise reaction taking place within the cracker. The hydrocarbon molecules are damaged up in a fairly random manner to provide combos of smaller hydrocarbons, a number of which have carbon-carbon double bonds. This is the best one way in which this unique molecule might cut up. Ethene and propene are important substances for making plastics or generating other organic chemicals. The octane is one of the molecules located in petrol or fuel.Catalytic crackingAn essential process in the field of , Catalytic cracking in one of the major cracking methods. Modern cracking uses zeolites as the catalyst. These are complex aluminosilicates, and are massive lattices of aluminum, silicon and oxygen atoms carrying a negative charge. They are, of direction, related to nice ions along with sodium ions. You might also have to stumble upon a zeolite if you realize about ion trade resins used in water softeners.The zeolites utilized in catalytic cracking are selected to present excessive possibilities of hydrocarbons with between five and 10 carbon atoms - particularly useful for producing petrol. For UK A level and alike purposes, you are not expected to understand how the catalyst works, but you'll be predicted to recognize that it entails anionic intermediate. Experienced people that are working with catalytic cracking on a daily basis know exactly how this works.Thermal crackingThe second type of cracking is Thermal cracking. In thermal cracking, excessive temperatures, generally within the variety of 450°C to 750°C and pressures normally up to approximately 70 atmospheres are used to break the large hydrocarbons into smaller ones. Thermal cracking offers combinations of merchandise containing high proportions of hydrocarbons with double bonds. These double bonds are called alkenes.Thermal cracking does not cross thru ionic intermediates like catalytic cracking. Instead, carbon-carbon bonds are broken so that every carbon atom finally ends up with a single electron. In different phrases, loose radicals are formed. You just need to remember that from country to country, these processes, temperature and the ingredients to thermal cracking are different. So, you might want to search for the type of process that is being made in your country.This is what you need to know about Cracking Alkanes. That there are two types of cracking, the Catalytic cracking and the thermal cracking. If you still don’t understand what this is all about, don’t worry.

In fact, the first report of this conversion was in 1920. Catalytic cracking, additionally called cat cracking, is the breaking of huge molecules into smaller ones at improved temperatures through using a catalyst. Thermal cracking reactions are free-radical reactions, whereas catalytic cracking reactions continue via the carbonize ion and are therefore extra predictable and better controlled.The product from cat cracking is of a higher octane score than the product received with thermal cracking. For these reasons, cat cracking is the desired method and has almost entirely replaced thermal cracking.Catalyst explainedIt is a substance that increases the fee of a chemical reaction, however, that does not itself go through an everlasting chemical alternate. Catalysts can be present at very low tiers and but nevertheless have an extensive impact on a huge scale reaction.Some catalysts which include the Lewis acid, also known as AlCl3 are quite common in nature and can be used to catalyze a diffusion of reactions. Other catalysts, which include the biochemical protein enzymes, may be very specific, as a result being useful for best one particular response.How it works and other interesting informationBecause the cracking response takes place at an elevated temperature, each the feedstock and the catalyst are preheated prior to coming into touch with each other within the reaction sector. Even though this reaction takes area at an extended temperature, it is not to be harassed with thermal cracking. Catalysts have modified over time, however, are by and large zeolites or a mix of the crystalline zeolites with amorphous catalystThe cracking reaction produces a spread of chemical compounds such as coke, which results in a layer of coke forming at the catalyst. Coke is a solid residue consisting generally of carbon, which may be used as a gasoline.Typical cutting-edge catalytic cracking reactors operate at 480–550 °C (900–1,020 °F) and at exceptionally low pressures of zero.7 to at least one.4 bars (70 to a hundred and forty KPa), or 10 to 20 psi. The catalyst is a strong sand-like fabric that is made fluid via the recent vapor and liquid fed into the FCC. FCC has the same properties as quicksand.Because the catalyst is fluid, it could circulate across the FCC, shifting between reactor and regenerator vessels. The FCC makes use of the catalyst and heat to interrupt apart the massive molecules of gasoline oil into the smaller molecules that make up gas, distillate, and other higher-value products like butane and propane. Giving you a better idea of how the catalyst works and the process of catalyst cracking.Catalytic cracking. Something that not many do understand.

The phone call cost the potential “winner” a certain amount per minute with an unusually-long wait time on hold. The real winner was the scamming company which made money off the phone calls.Today's thieves have a wide choice of scam-delivery mechanisms, including in person, the mail, phone and internet.  However, the same holds true no matter how the scam is delivered: if it sounds too good to be true, it is.How Can You Recognize the Lottery or Sweepstakes Scam?There are certainly legitimate lotteries and sweepstakes offers. Who hasn't bought a state or multi-state lottery ticket from their local lottery retailer? Or, who hasn't seen one of those sweepstakes offered by a recognized company advertising in the coupon section of the Sunday newspaper? You fill out the entry form or reasonable facsimile (usually a 3”x5” card) with your name and address and send it off.Therein is your biggest clue as to whether you're the victim of a scam. In a legitimate lottery or sweepstakes you have bought the ticket or entered your name and address. In a scam lottery or sweepstakes you are notified you've won when you haven't even entered or bought a ticket.In addition, it's illegal to use the mail or telephone to play lotteries across borders, whether national or state lines. Any lottery offer involving the purchase of lottery tickets for other state or country lotteries could end up with you being charged with illegal activities.One ploy used by foreign scammers involving lotteries or sweepstakes is offering you an “advance” on your winnings. The scam artist will send you a check for part of your “winnings.” All you have to do is wire them payment for “taxes” or other official purposes. By the time you find out their check has bounced the money you wired is in their hands. And, because it was wired it's harder to trace.Lottery scammers don't always use e-mail or the phone. Sometimes they do their dirty work in person. A typical scam would go something like this: You are approached in person by someone who claims he or she just won the lottery but isn't eligible to claim it. They offer to split the money with you if you claim the prize. Sounds good, right? Except that before you claim the prize from the lottery retailer you are required to withdraw some money from your account and give it to the ticket holder as a good-faith gesture. By the time you find out you're holding a non-winning lottery ticket, the thief is long-gone with your good-faith money.In order to protect yourself from these scams, it's important to remember the following:Lotteries** It's illegal to use the mail or telephone to play lotteries across borders.** If you ever receive a phone call, letter or e-mail announcing you just won a lottery, it's a scam.Sweepstakes** It's illegal for a company to require you to pay to win or claim a sweepstakes prize.** It's illegal for a company to suggest that buying something will improve your chances of winning.** Companies cannot ask for money from you for taxes they say you owe on a sweepstakes winning.** Be cautious when entering sweepstakes from displays you see in malls – often times these are people just wanting your name and address for a future sweepstakes scam.** Only enter sweepstakes from recognizable companies, and never pay a fee to enter.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/scams/how-i-won-the-lottery-or-maybe-not.html"},
{"heading": "3 State Level Tax Hikes That Might Be Coming Due To COVID-19", "author": "mianahmad", "description": "No surprise, but Americans are consuming and spending less since the coronavirus kicked in.  Retail sales dropped to 8.7 percent in March, the largest month-over-month decline since the Census Bureau started tracking this data. Previously, the sharpest decline was less than half this – at 3.9 percent from October 2008 to November 2008, during the previous economic crisis. The reduction in consumer spending is due in part to lockdowns, spending more time at home for fear of the virus, and the economic impact – whether it’s losing a job, reduced hours, or in anticipation of tougher times ahead.", "word-count": 423, "body": "While consumer spending is down at a net level, there appear to be some winners and some losers in the post-COVID world of staying in and working from home. Restaurants and apparel are the hardest hit, whereas online retailers, home, garden, grocery, and alcohol sales are all up.The decline and shift in consumer spending are having a strong negative impact on state sales tax revenues. Nationwide, sales taxes account for approximately 20 percent of all state revenue, so the decline in consumer spending will have a material impact on state budgets. As a result, states are looking at new ways to generate or increase revenue to offset the trend. Below we’ll look at three ways states are looking to raise taxes to make up for holes in their budgets.Grocery Staples Eating out less and working from home mean Americans are spending more at the grocery store; approximately 13 percent more year-over-year, per Census data. The issue for states is that groceries are generally not taxed or low-taxed, although there are a few items that apply the full tax rate.Kansas, for example, applies the full  to groceries. The consequence of this is that grocery sales make up about 15 percent of Kansas’ total sales tax revenue. The consequence of this policy is that the state’s sales tax revenue has barely taken a hit year-to-date.States are taking notice and may move to the trend of taxing groceries as a way to recover part of their declining sales tax revenues.Digital TaxesAnother trend is the increase in streaming services and one-time rentals/purchases of digital goods for entertainment and working at home. Currently, 22 states tax streaming services, and 30 states tax digital goods. Other states will look to start taxing these services as well, and digital taxes will start to expand into cloud storage and other services as more people work remotely.Sin TaxesSin taxes are taxes on goods and services that are “bad” for us; think alcohol, tobacco, gambling, and marijuana (where it’s legal). Increases in sin taxes are generally easier to pass as they don’t apply to the overall general population and politicians can play the moral angle.During the last recession, for example, lawmakers in more than 12 states increased tobacco and liquor taxes. Newer sin taxes are being instituted, such as those on vaping equipment and supplies.ConclusionThe exact form and structure will vary, but one thing is certain: States will institute or increase taxes in areas where the money is being spent to ensure their sales tax revenue remains stable. <link rel='canonical' '&lt;a%20' view-source:https:>https://www.dynamicontent.net/article.php?dcarticleid=1785' /&gt;", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/sales/3-state-level-tax-hikes-that-might-be-coming-due-to-covid-19.html"},

towards a lower energy center, the flow continues until both the energies attain equal levels.  The power attained via Gayatri is a mature state of the above fact.  When man’s consciousness in his material body becomes all-pervasive, same sighted and omnipotent like solar consciousness, he can decipher the state of water, wind and people’s health and can also read other peoples’ minds.  He also becomes the lord of other subtle powers.", "word-count": 2708, "body": "MEDITATING ON SAVITA OR SOLAR DEITY VIA SUPER POWER GAYATRI http://www.shriramsharma.com/part_6%20and%207.htm  A well-known fact regarding sound is that take a tuning fork and a wire with the same vibratory movement.  On the wire place a small folded piece of paper.  Now lightly bang the tuning fork to an object so as to induce vibrations and then bring it close to the wire on which is placed a folded paper.  As a result the paper on the wire starts “dancing.”  At such times the contact medium between the wire and tuning fork was space only.  The vibrations in a tuning fork induce vibrations in the wire too.  It is because of the fact that vibrations were induced in the wire that the paper attached too it started moving.   There is another experiment.  Tune a drum to the scale of Pancham (5th note).  If the clouds thunder in the Pancham scale during the rainy season, one must see the effect of its thunderous sound on the drum placed on earth.  The leather of the drum will tear up on its own and this miracle is due to the powerful vibrations of sound.   Just like the 2 experiments mentioned above, the 24 lettered Gayatri Mantra manifests vibrations which helps man and the sun (having same elements) establish a mental bond.  The sun and a human being are the same, from the elemental point of view.  The scriptures say –   “The sun is the very soul of this world.”   Our consciousness is the soul of the world as the body.  The 24 letters of Gayatri have the power to induce similar vibratory movement in both their consciousness and thus a bond is established.  http://www.shriramsharma.com/part_6%20and%207.htm There is a scientific law that when a higher energy stream flows towards a lower energy center, the flow continues until both the energies attain equal levels.  The power attained via Gayatri is a mature state of the above fact.  When man’s consciousness in his material body becomes all-pervasive, same sighted and omnipotent like solar consciousness, he can decipher the state of water, wind and people’s health and can also read other peoples’ minds.  He also becomes the lord of other subtle powers.  He can also destroy the entire world but because he has established a bond with the solar deity, the Gayatri devotee is compassionate, pure intellected and imbibes a sense of goodwill towards all like the sun.  To put it differently if a Gayatri devotee starts utilizing his sacred qualities and pious thinking for the welfare of the world, the goal of spiritual practices undertaken by him will be easily achieved.   If a person is seated in a peaceful manner and some one approaches him with a request, the request will generally be fulfilled.  If a pond is absolutely tranquil, a pebble thrown in it will induce vibrations.  This is an admixture of the nature of sacred sentiments and science.  All the Acharsamhitas and scientific experiments carried out by Indian preceptors had their basis in the principles mentioned above.  In the past I myself too had taken recourse to this subtle philosophy and in conducting one experiment.  It was in the form of a Great Yajna that had 1000 Kundis (pyres).  I had previously read that if at a specific hour, in a specific manner,  Gayatri Meditation and Yajna is performed, one can influence the spiritual powers of the solar deity in a specific manner and also attract it towards our soul.  Not only does an individual gain joy, wealth and peace of mind, but that society as a whole, the nation and the entire world too attain it.  http://www.shriramsharma.com/part_6%20and%207.htm The 1000 Kundi (pyres) Yajna of October 1958 was of this type.  Later weather scientists too agreed with our observations.  Between the year 1st July 1957 to 31st December 1958, astronomers of the world declared it the “International Year of the Quiet Sun”.  It was given this name because the sun had quietened down and thus gave the opportunity to world scientists to carry out various experiments.  At around this time we had started Yajna preparations.  Gayatri devotees, a year back, had executed Gayatri Purascharanas (rites) and in the year 1958 (October) after performing a Yajna of 4 days, it was ended on Sharad Purnima.  Gayatri’s deity is Savita and hence the goal of Gayatri movement was to study it and make apt use of it.  On such occasions it is relatively easier to attain divine powers.  With these divine powers, the underlying aim was to usher in world well-being.   After this gigantic Yajna, we were keeping a close watch on all world activities.  We were amazed to note that not only nature changed her course, but that the psyche of world humanity too had transformed positively.  Today people of Europe who previously led lives of “Eat, drink and be merry”, are taking great interest in spiritual matters.  India will definitely benefit even if the results will be seen mainly after the year 1995 A.D.  In one’s daily life the sun is quiet at sunrise and sunset.  Hence Indian seers have ordained us to chant Mantras at dawn and dusk.  Research studies conducted on the sun’s material nature ordains us to carry out special spiritual practices during Navaratri.  Modern science too agrees with this.   According to the time cycle lasting over ages, the world is to witness two great revolutions in the near future.  These changes are due to sun’s spots which bring natural changes every 11 years.  But, in the coming years, for some special reasons, there will be a break in the time cycle and the Sun will bring forth revolutionary changes which may include very heavy rains, famine, epidemics, war, earthquakes and the kind.  Only those people will survive from these calamities who have established their identity with the sun spiritually.  http://www.shriramsharma.com/part_6%20and%207.htm Such warnings have been given by us since sometime in the past, which are based on the science of astronomy and such forecasts are backed by modern science also.  Indians have lived under the yoke of foreigners like the Mughals and Britishers for the last 1,000 years and this stage is coming to an end before the close of this century as is revealed by the science of the Sun.   The earth traverses a distance of nine crores and thirty lakh miles to revolve round the sun, moving at the rate of 67,000 miles per hour, taking 365.25days for completing one revolution round the sun.  In four years’ time, 0.25 days makes one complete day (which in a leap year according to the Gregorian calendar) having 366 days.  Thus for entering into a new year of its own and to reappear on the same axis, the earth takes 365.25 X 4 = 1,461 years).   In this fashion, a cycle of 1,461 years will be completed by earth by the end of this century.  The world is going to witness the great power of the sun in action and the earth will lose its own physical powers i.e., powers created by man, which are not based on spirituality but which are based on material sciences.  Only those will survive this great avalanche, who have their moorings with the sun and his powers like the flowers on the surface of the ocean, or like the boats tied up with the moorings.  The Gayatri upasakas will no doubt watch such changes with awe, but will derive power from the sun to remain moved and undisturbed and unperplexed, like the child being showered with love, although the mother may seem enraged at times.  This child is not afraid of its mother.   One should not be under the impression that the whole human race and culture will be wiped out in such a calamitous situation.  Till the sun is there, the world will be there.  In the field of consciousness, the animal kingdom is only a part of the sun.  The sun will remain for a 100 crore years and he will supply life-power (Prana Shakti) and light.  Till the sun exists and till hydrogen exists, this world will remain.  The earth is feeling today like taking a bath and cleanse itself, and the changes in nature are an indication of such a desire.  http://www.shriramsharma.com/part_6%20and%207.htm The scientists engaged in the study of sun’s rays – the magnetic field of the earth, and the outer space have come to the conclusions that the sun is agitating at times on his own.  What is the reason?  The scientists have not been able to analyse the causes.  They have no answer so far.  But they believe that during a period of 11 years, there is a period of one year when the sun is agitated very much.  The agitated sun churns the entire universe (Saura Mandala) of which the world is a part.  At that time flames are thrown out and there is spray of minute atoms.  The modern scientists have not been able to know with what such subtle and minute atoms mingle.  But the spiritual scientists have already recorded that along with other atoms, these extra atoms create the agitation and the gross matter is not affected much, but the subtle nature of man i.e., his thoughts, emotions, decisions and even faith tend to change.  Although one cannot comprehend such changes easily, one can feel the revolutionary changes in the society and other fields viz., commerce, trade, labour, employment and in social behaviour.  Such changes confirm the fact that the sun is not a fire-ball of matter alone but is the master of life and psyche.  Those who understand this will surely enter into the firmament of Gayatri.  They will develop better attitude towards Sadhana and try to acquire knowledge and maintain self-control.  Such people alone will guide the world.   The modern scientists have known and analysed the influence of the sun on gross matter.  We get light, heat and rain due to the sun.  The sun maintains different temperatures at different places on the earth and in water and gives motion to the wind.  The sun nourishes the cornheads.  We get minerals in vegetation and even in flowers due to the sun only.  All these are as a result of the heat of the sun, and external influence he exerts on matter.  The temperature at the center of the sun we are told, is 1,100° F.  No matter in the world can sustain this heat even for a fraction of a second.  This influence of the sun is visible and this experience has become so common that people have forgotten its importance.  The sun at times assumes a temperature as high as 290,00,000° F.  When compared with this high temperature, the earth seems to be possessing nearly freezing temperature.  Due to the tremendous heat of the sun, the granules that spread in the universe start agitating.  The size of these granules varies from 600 sq. kms. to 1,400 sq. kms. and they are round or evenly angular in shape.  These granules at times shine and at times not, and seem to merge in the sun’s orbit and they seem to have disappeared.  But due to these, there is a mysterious upheaval on the earth.  Their waves are like that of a filament-snake, moving round the sun and causing changes in the atmosphere and as a result of this, several changes in nature on the earth are seen.  There is no fixed cycle for such changes but such serious changes do take place once in a period of 11 years.  Particularly, such a period is more useful for attaining spiritual powers – Siddhis.  By doing japa during such periods, one can attract such moving atoms and fix and contain those atoms in one’s body and get physical, spiritual and material benefits.  That is why a campaign for Gayatri Upasana and its propagation has to be conducted so that everyone benefits spiritually.  In such a campaign, all the Gayatri devotees have to play their roles.http://www.shriramsharma.com/part_6%20and%207.htm  In the year 1966, it was the 19th cycle of this revolutionary changes period.  In that year, during the months May and June there were unprecedented floods in the U.S.S.R., Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, India, Italy, the U.S.A. and Afghanisthan etc.  Bulgaria witnessed the heaviest snowfall ever recorded in its history on 16th June.  Cuba had unprecented floods on 18th May in which thousands of trees were uprooted, and the crops were washed away.  The house-tops were blown off.  During this period only, India had heavy floods and many thousands were rendered homeless.   We have already mentioned above that the coming years are going to witness tremendous changes in Nature.  Particularly the years 1988 and 1999 will be witnessing nature’s wrath in an unprecedented way.  It will not be a wonder if territorial changes also take place in some countries during such periods.  All this visible change is due to the sun only.  The scientists have failed to answer us the why and how of it, because they have analysed only physical powers of matter but not the spiritual power which affects matter even.   According to the science of Gayatri, there are two main principles of creation.  One is life (Prana) and the other gross matter.  Gross matter cannot move without the life-force.  The body of man which is created out of the five elements is very much natural.  This is a part of Gayatri sound, and just as the sounds of Gayatri Mantra merge into the air, similarly the human body is also created and merges in Nature.  The second principle is Prana i.e., life.  Prana is the foundation of Savita (the Sun) whose visible part is material but the invisible part is psychical where there is intense activity.  The sun in this part is very powerful.  That is why it is said in the Shrutis ‘pranah Prajnam udayatyesa suryah’, etc.  the sun in combination with Prana creates life.  The sun’s material replica is gross but at the same time it is full of power of Brahma.   The sages have called the sun as Trayi-Vidya etc., combination of three (1) gross matter (out of which the physical body is made), (2) the body as such, and (3) the mind (which gives inspiration or impulses for activity).   When we see visible changes in the sun, we wonder with awe, but if we establish our link with him through Gayatri mantra and identify ourselves with the sun, we can get the three spiritual benefits viz., health, vigour and a contented, composed and satisfied mind.  These are things essential for peace, prosperity and happiness of mankind.   When the world humanity will fully understand this science, there will be no lack of joy, peace and wealth.  As against this, those individuals of the world who will try and understand this spiritual philosophy (during the phase of confluence of Era Transformation) and spread it in the entire world will gain more name, fame and glory. AUTHOR: Shriram Sharma Acharya founder of the International Gayatri Family was a great Yogi seer and incarnation of God who wrote volumes of scientific literature mainly on spiritual

''We know our parties of onlookers get in contact on social, so we should be there' is the as consistently as could be normal the situation being what it is as could sensibly be ordinary utilized light behind shallow, fragile tries. As more individuals put wide measures of centrality in web sorting out channels, and as these channels illustration of various parts in their lives (sidekick organizer, course supplier, taking a gander at recommender, news gatekeeper, and the sky is the most far away point starting there), it winds up being amazingly more crucial to consider long range interpersonal correspondence strategy essential. Here are a couple of ways you can quit vacillating about it :Place in moving: Some of the most part web sorting out supporters view web arranging channels as an other pulled back storeroom. We have to get web sorting out a spot on the insisted pushing table. It is all around that truly matters as major as TV, print, paid motorized, PR and each other publicizing limit. Do whatever it takes not to get 'some person' to control it for you. Get some individual key to do it.Reason: Social by arrangement requires the gathering of people to have co-made or completely got tied up with the reason. In like way, the best occasions of brand-drove social battles move out of a joint introduction with get-together, and a solid impression of what a specific party of observers range really sees as substance. Here, like never before some time starting late, you have to think, for event, the client.Quality over entire: Facebook maybe secured us out when they decreased standard fulfill close nothing. Starting now and into the not very cleared we began listening to more exceptional lines, for case, 'quality over aggregate'. Regardless, why was that an exchange off notwithstanding? In social – as in some other excellent showcasing – there is centrality and quality in an inside, focused on thought, and the requirement for good depicting. Being in some individual's face with nothing wonderful to say, never at whatever time had each one of the stores of being astoundingly and excellent – paying little personality to when it didn't cost anything.Looking over that it as a limit, not an endeavor: Whoever deals with your social channels (inside or remotely) should be super hot about it, know channels and their best utilize, and be associated with the gatherings of people you need to join with. On the off chance that Executive Assistants, Admin staff or even the lesser most driving asset in the party handles the social summon, it may be dumbfounding over do nothing by any structures. You will get no true blue effect from on an extremely fundamental level 'being' on social, and not putting the favorable position bended set behind it.Benchmarks: Watch out for supporting nonattendance of worth with awe inspiring considering, quick execution, and standard substance. I host been in gatherings with brand proprietors who converse with an uncommon level of the amazing social substance they make, all around truant to how customary the work is. Dealing with a web sorting out page at a particularly key level is high exertion. Before long, don't adjust push with result or quality. Do whatever it takes not to make concessions for yourself. Additionally, all around that truly matters as crucial for work environments.Limit : Social media strategists will shape into being purpose of actuality the most respected assets in the affecting field. In any case, not in a general sense as get-together powers, social stars or substance authorities. They need to advance into adjusted showcasing individuals who grasp the channels enough, begin from a brand outlining out introduction to have the capacity to have a consider what destinations can be refined on social, and how one can get in contact (through substance, social engagement and client appreciation).Additionally, this is not only a variable of knowing conspicuous society, being unlimited and 'with-it', having the capacity to write in a contemporary, joining with way or having the capacity to consider topical (and basic) social spikes. It is these, yet above all it is about having a fundamental impression of brands, the capacity to take a gander at more perceptible targets and estimations, and the bowed set to tell an affecting, interfacing with and key brand story with different parts, over various stages to enormous social affairs of people.Wire : It is key for any web sorting out fit to consider a 'long range obliging correspondence engagement' thought, or upgrade something that is being done in some other medium on social. What is troublesome – and truly adjusting – is having the cutoff in any case an inside brand or battle thought, and open up it over all channels and media. This obliges us in spite of a media or channel realist brand thought. Additionally, what showcasing channel best redesigns it.Fundamentally old news new you say? That is affirmed. In any case, as social event sections watch the opportunity to be limited, and capacities to focus diminish, driving boss (brands and association) are reflecting this isolated, ascent point of view. As front line and web sorting out finds a more laid out space in driving talks, it is in addition time to backtrack to the stray pieces and right this system. Not any more social-on a very basic level battle briefs. Begin with the business or correspondence issue.There are tasteful illustrations and cases today – all around and in India – of brands that have been maintained fundamentally with a sound and joined web planning method, and execution. In business parts like India, where standard media proceeds with decision the perch in like path as media spends and pushing tries go, breathtaking promoters can get a key enlightenment behind slant by giving web sorting out system connecting with thought.

Controllers have to take up the responsibility on ensuring fool-proof security for all age groups.Events are for giving relaxation time to people, so don’t make security a fuss for them. Numerous event organizers have opted this strategy for event advertisement where they use this tactic to sell out tickets by making security a mountain out of a molehill.  It’s up to you how would you give a fool-proof environment to all the attendees where they can enjoy freely without any fear. In this blog, we are going to discuss major security goals that have to be achieved by every organizing company.

Sponsors would suggest you some recommendations as well about how they want to see guests in a secure atmosphere. Hospitality should be up to the mark in all sections. Make sure there shouldn’t be any loophole in it which can give negative impact on all the participants.Review all the critical factors before the eventThis one is important to take a detailed look at critical factors where they can get to know about everything in advance. Yes, this would be the right approach, and it is measured as one of the ideal tricks where everything is listed out in advance to weigh all the reasons for break-ins. If we do detail planning in start, then we will be succeeded in mitigating all risks. First, you have to figure out the area first where the event is organized because the event in a residential area or vast ground would be different from a security point of view. So reviewing approaches would be different as well. Weather prediction is also an essential factor that needs your attention.Defining Risk FactorsYes, determining risk factors are essential because we know how much this is important to outline the risks. The success of an event is reliant on a preliminary evaluation of risks. You must be thinking what the jeopardies are? Crowd management, verified entries, festival parking, alcohol sales and much more can ruin the event. These are the main risks that can destroy the event, so if you are done with initial planning, then risk mitigation would be much easier. Weather forecast needs earlier planning, so you have to come up with backup plan to handle security efficiently.Ensure Implementation of deciding factorsYou might have paid many days and nights to figure out all the elements but let me tell you figuring out is not essential only you people have to ensure implementation of deciding factors as well. Without implementation, event organizers can’t give secure atmosphere to participants. Event organizers have to look into each factor and if they think they are unable to ensure its implementation then hiring security company would be an ideal choice. All you have to make sure that evaluated factor need implementation and it should be done at any cost.Good Organizational StructureDo you know what else is needed for the successful event? The good organizational structure is key to success for the festival. You must be thinking what kind of structure it would be? Well, let me tell you no event can be successful unless supportive team. From lower level to higher level everyone should be in contact with each other. Right officials would reduce the risks, and they would encourage people to attend all the festivals despite thinking of  issues. There shouldn’t be any miscommunication gap between leading commands and other personnel who are organising the event.Complete Credential StructureWell, this one is much important to have a track record of credentials because you can avoid any intruder activity first at the entry point. Make sure everyone has detailed credentials so if you want to do detail assessment later then that wouldn’t be problematic.  Unclear credentials would raise so many issues. Details are required from performers, vendors to participants. How many kids are enjoying the event and what is the current ratio of teenagers need to be evaluated as well. Statistical analysis would help you to assess the success of event. You would get to know either your event promotion has gone well or not. Apart from that, the credential structure is much more critical to ensure the security.These are the main aspects that would help out all the event organizers to deal event and festival security excellently. Security agencies are utilizing all the latest approaches to ensure the  best than ever. People always want to know about the security measurements before the event so every event organizer should hire reputable security agency. They would be responsible for security measurements that they would take to ensure the fool-proof environment.

So, this article helps you to know what’s what and show you a digital marketing guide. In the early 2000s, firstly it was popularized.If you are wondering about word digital marketing trends and want to know what it is… so, it is advertising delivered through various digital channels. Channels like social media, mobile apps, email, web apps, search engines, websites, or any new digital channel.Digital marketing is any form of electronic device marketing products or services.Because there are so many electronics products this is why it has been around for decades and it doesn't necessarily have anything to do with content marketing, Google ads, social media, or retargeting.Digital marketing can be done online and offline.And both are essential to a comprehensive  strategy.Digital Marketing services has two main pillars that are online marketing and offline marketing. However, since I will cover online marketing in a separate guide, for the sake of completeness, I will only mention the various areas of online marketing here.The 7 main categories of internet marketing:Here are 4 great categories of digital offline marketing.First, this is what I call advanced offline marketing. It is a form of marketing that is completely self-contained but supplemented by electronic devices.For example, if your restaurant uses an iPad for your customers to create their orders, then this electronic device enhances the offline experience of, say, eating Thai food.People have used digital media for decades to improve their marketing.Then comes radio marketing. The next time you hear an annoying and enthusiastic car dealer shouting every word of their ad, thank Mr. Marconi.Of course, television marketing shouldn't be forgotten either. Television advertising has been around for over half a century (and since 1953 it has also been in color across the country - yes, there was a time before color television).Finally, the largest and fastest-growing area of offline marketing, with certainly many flops, failures, and failures too: telephone marketing.Any product demo is an essential part of your  strategy If you have any type of electronic product.check out the category of digital marketing which has probably been around the longest.It's been over 100 years since that first live broadcast of a Metropolitan opera show, and guess what: the radio is still here.Since radio has advanced fairly well in the transition to the Internet, it has not been as successful as television. And even the old school radio still matters. Every weak radio still reaches 85% of the US population.Listeners listen on average 2 hours a day40% of all radio advertising spending in the world is in the United States.About half of the US population listens to Internet radio at least once a month.Television marketing is such a Goliath, it probably will never disappear. It is also the industry where most money is spent each year.Since Google Video evolved into Youtube, the effectiveness of TV ads has rapidly declined.Who wants to watch a lousy MTV host review a game he has no idea about when he can join 40 million subscribers. Watching PewDiePie not only sparks video games but also delivers hilarious commentary.More than 80% of internet users now have smartphones.  In 2014 we crossed the tipping point where more people go online from their phones than from their desktops or laptops.But before we look at the type of phone marketing you can do to internet-connected smartphone users.

Following here are some of the most common mistakes made by entrepreneurs while crafting a social media campaign for their businesses.Considering all social networking platforms to be the samePeople often make a mistake by considering all the social media networks to be same. But what we must understand is; Every social networking platform hosts a unique ecosystem featuring its own set of nuances and implications. Instagram doesn’t allow you to post captions with clickable links. On the other hand, Twitter comes with a stipulated character limit of 280 characters maximum for posts whereas, LinkedIn is entirely a professional network and Pinterest is mainly based on creativity. So, it is pretty clear that they are not similar or even close enough. Thus, preparing a single post for all your social media profiles is a mistake that would restrict your campaign to reach optimum results.Not having a well-defined strategyNothing can work out without a proper strategy in a business. And thus, not having a business-specific social media strategy would act as the main hindrance to achieve digital success for your organisation. You simply cannot boost your social presence by posting images or reposting content regularly. It has to have a clear objective, and direction before you invest your valuable resources and time on social media marketing. Important considerations like the distribution schedule and timeframe of the campaigns must be pre-defined to work strategically.Paying no attention to your followersThe prime goal of having a social media presence is to connect with your target audience digitally. Interacting with your prospects, and existing followers/customers would help you in cultivating your brand image and recognition. But often organisations fail to give due importance to these followers by not responding to them promptly, not addressing their negative reviews or feedback, not engaging with them through their posts, and much more. This in turn, affects your brand image adversely thereby, demonstrating it not to be so brand-centric, and responsible.Prioritising quantity over qualityPosting too often on your social media platforms can also be a problem as over-posting lead to increase in unfollowing your brand. What you need to focus on is posting enriched, high quality, unique, and engaging content on your social media profiles that would help you derive quality-oriented, ROI-driven results with help of expert social media management in Australia. Posting too many contents frequently might disturb your customers and thus, you need to ensure of choosing quality over quantity always.Developing an excessively promotional social media presenceIt would not be completely right if you consider your social media profile to be only a promotional tool. Research studies have revealed the fact that posting too many ads lead to unfollowing a particular brand by followers. Thus, it won’t be the ideal thing to consider your social media presence as a billboard for marketing purposes. Rather it’s a medium to encourage engagement with your customers and broaden your community. It also serves as a major source of acquiring valuable market insights and inculcate the same in your business for fostering growth. Concluding note!Your social media presence is perhaps the most important thing you need for promoting your brand online at this hour. Thus, be very careful while developing a social media strategy that comprises of no mistakes, no complexities, and is directed towards achieving maximum customer engagement. Always hire a renowned social media marketing company in Australia to avoid making such mistakes thereby, ensuring that you gain optimum digital success and facilitate persistent growth.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/online-promotion/mistakes-to-avoid-while-crafting-a-social-media-marketing-strategy.html"},

No matter when you’ve bought your piece, even items designed and produced now draw fashion inspiration from previous decades. In 2020, pretty much anything goes, and different styles are constantly coming in and out of fashion. When it comes to vintage clothing, you can’t ignore the history of , and how these have shaped our wardrobes over the years. We’ll run through the decades from the 1950s to 2020 and take a look at the most popular vintage jacket trends and styles for each. 1950s – The BlazerAlthough it made its debut in Vogue in June 1893, the blazer had its first major revival in the 1950s. This style of jacket was initially designed to be worn by rowers at Oxford and Cambridge. The blazer soon became part of a gentleman’s attire outside of rowing, where owning one signalled status and prestige. These days anyone can rock a blazer, and it’s a great item to have on hand to finish a preppy look. 1960s – The BomberMods and rockers were two youth subcultures at war with one another, dominating the social scene in Britain in the early-mid 1960s. Both groups had distinct looks, with rockers opting for practical leather biker jackets whereas mods wore bomber jackets. Brands like Fred Perry were beloved by the mods, but the bomber trend could also be seen across the pond, where baseball and varsity jackets were super popular with high school and college students in the US. 1970s – The Penny LaneThe decade of free love saw many new and exciting fashion trends emerge. From corduroy to suede, the 70s was possibly one of the coolest decades for fashion. One of the most popular jacket styles from this time would have been a Sherpa or Shearling-lined jacket in a gorgeous russet colour. Pop one on and you’ll be channelling your inner Penny Lane in no time.  1980s – The DenimFirst created in the US circa 1880 by denim godfather Levi Strauss, denim jackets became a particular crowd-pleaser with women in the 1980s. Shorter, cropped and more fitted styles were becoming widely available for a more feminine look. But there were also many options available for a more oversized, baggy fit which we’ve also come to associate the 80s with. Dyes like acid wash were also incredibly trendy during this time, as well as customising with studs and embroidery.1990s – The WindbreakerSports jackets and windbreakers were all the rage in the 90s. These retro jackets are making a comeback now and for very good reason – they’re lightweight, easy to wear and can be paired with anything, not to mention the range of colours and patterns that they come in too! 2000s – The LeatherPVC jackets had a moment in the 2000s, but the leather jacket definitely had the upper hand when it came to longevity. Dubbed the “uniform of 2010”, you can finish off a simple look of a T-shirt and skinny jeans with one of these bad boys. This should be a staple in everybody’s wardrobe for its versatility and functionality. The leather jacket has the unique ability to be chic yet casual, great for dressing up or down any outfit. 2010s – The PufferThe last decade has seen a whole range of jackets come back into fashion, with so many of these popular trends revolving around the ability to be functional and practical as well as cool and stylish. Waxed jackets by brands like Barbour were hugely popular during this time. But probably one of the most common styles from this period is the puffer jacket, particularly important if you want to be cosy in winter but still look your best. 2020s – ?As we head into the new decade, a world of exciting new possibilities awaits us and our wardrobes.

{"heading": "White German Shepherd: Guide To Long Haired White Shepherds", "author": "5amily Ltd", "description": "These White German Shepherds with plush white coats, a good intellect, sporty, and an over-all fun and healthy breed have a remarkable pedigree!", "word-count": 1648, "body": "So if you want an adorable white prestigious dog, who acts and loves you exactly like a German Shepherd, and if you can cope with bathing the dog frequently to keep that white fur clean, then we suggest this White Shepherd is what you are looking for.What Do We Know About White German Shepherds?These dogs naturally belong to a diligent breed and have a high intellect.They are not any different from the tanned German Shepherds. However, the only thing that distinguishes the two, is their white fur.German Shepherds contain the same recessive white fur gene exactly like humans have the recessive blonde hair gene. This recessive gene thus results in white German Shepherd puppies.Though this breed of German Shepherd was never quite popular due to their white color as compared to other color variations.Yet undoubtedly, have been the second most registered breed, as per the sources of American Kennel Club.These dogs are known as great professionals when it comes to working force professions, like police, military, and herding.But they are also great at being a family pet due to their loving, protective, and loyal nature.The Genesis of the BreedThese White German Shepherds were directly bred from the German Shepherd breed.To understand the origin of this breed, we need to look into the German Shepherd’s background history.Von Stephanitz discovered the German Shepherd at a dog show and thought that the dog breed would be best for a working dog.He was inspired by the dog’s incredible intelligence, beauty, and behavior.So he adopted the dog and named him “Horand” and soon the society for German Shepherds was created known as “Verein für Deutsche Schäferhunde”.84 puppies were bred from that dog as he was the first breed standard and gave birth to similar appearance dogs. The Pedigree and Recognition of Kennel ClubIn 1906, the dog was first taken to the United States of America and two years later, in 1908, he was registered in the American Kennel Club.However, the White German Shepherd breed gods are neither registered nor recognized by the American Kennel Club.They are known as a different breed by the United Kennel Club since the white color does not meet the breed standards of the American Kennel Club of the Shepherds.Nonetheless, these dogs are so adorable that their breeding could never be stopped and have become the darlings for almost everyone.Breeding Information about the White German Shepherd DogsLifespan About 12 to 14 yearsWeight Females 50 to 70 and Males 66 to 85 poundsSize Females 22 to 24' and Males 24 to 26' poundsBreed Type Herding GroupObjective Herding Dogs and WorkingBest Fit For Couples, Families, and BachelorsColors Pure WhiteNature Intelligent, Loyal, Sporty, Protective and CaringOther Names White ShepherdAdorable White German Shepherd MunchkinsWhite German Shepherd puppies tend to grow faster. So around the age of four months, they reach almost half of their adult height and weight.The size of their litter is about five to ten puppies.The cost of these puppies is around 750 USD to 1,000 USD.But make sure not to get scammed in case your breeder is attempting cross-breeding with German Shepherds with other breeds and fooling you by presenting you a white dog looking similar to a pure white German Shepherd breed.These puppies reach their full adult form and potential by the age of one year.Temperaments of the White German ShepherdsCharacteristics RatingsFriendly Character ***Confidence ****Protective Nature *****Prey Drive ****Social Behavior ****Due to these dogs’ protective nature, it is best to train their social skills at their earliest.Training them on their socialization with other animals and new people around them will lessen the unnecessary barking at every other stranger. Their barking and howling can easily be dealt with if trained accordingly at an early age. However, these white German Shepherds do often bark out of their protective and loving nature, and thus will go to any lengths for their owners.The barking does not mean they are aggressive or don’t like cuddling. It just shows their cautious attitude when meeting new people and would naturally want to protect you out of care and love.Family IndulgenceWhen it comes to taking care of family members and providing them love, white German Shepherds are at the front in the queue. They will take care of your children with utmost warmth under their paws or wings.White German Shepherds are naturally high on their prey drive, so care must be shown around infants and proper training must be given to fulfill their socialization requirements.They have a tendency to mingle with other dogs and animals easily.So it is necessary to begin their training as early as possible, because once they grow older, they may be conservative around new people and animals. But they are also very loving.Personality TypeIt is said that white Shepherds are mostly shy but playful than tanned Shepherds, but when it comes to personality, both the breeds possess the same type.When we talk about German Shephards, ‘loyalty’ is the word that is associated with them the most.These dogs are known to have strong appearances but internally they are loyal, loving, and devoting.Since this breed is quite protective and self-assured, they make outstanding guard dogs.These dogs are used in police and military forces because of their strength, loyalty, protective temperament, and therefore making them hard-working dogs. They are the wisest and most desirable breed of dogs.AppearanceWhite German Shepherds are well-known for being sporty and manly.They are usually lean as they were bred for their hardworking potential.The posture is strong and confident, even when they are puppies and have large feet.The gene that affects their white fur is only constrained to that very element. It has no effect on their eyes or skin colors.Thus making the identification of this breed simple.They resemble the tan Shepherds with the same colored eyes – dark brown.It is said that their snow-white coats reflect their ancestor – wolves. Color Variation Yes, their smiles put smiles on your face. They are just so adorable when grinning like a goof. White German Shepherds usually have two coat types; long coat or short coat. White German Shepherds have longer coats compared to that of tanned German Shepherds with long coats.They have mostly thick and straight fur. As puppies they softer and fluffier, but with time the fur gets coarser. However, their ears remain the same forever. The double-coat is protection against severe weather conditions.SizeThey weigh around 50 to 85 pounds. Females usually lie in the lower range from 50 to 70 pounds whereas, males lie on the higher of these numbers.HeightVarying from 22 to 26 inches at the shoulder, this breed is considered large and very tall. But females usually fall shorter between 22 to 24 inches.The Grooming Requirements of White German ShepherdsTo avoid the knots in their fur, brushing them regularly is significant. All white German Shepherds have a thick coat which signifies their shed every year around.Brushing them twice or thrice a week is very important as early as possible so they are used to it.Bathing is required occasionally when your pet is dirty or you feel like it really needs a shower day now.Do not forget to brush their teeth. It is important to keep that smile brighter and shinier. During their dental treatments, white German Shepherds are easy to handle so you will feel less burdened. As suggested by the vets, try brushing their teeth with a pet special toothbrush. A Complete Guide to The Care of White ShepherdsPlaytime plays a good part in exercising your pet alongside running, strolling and even time spent at doggy daycare is essential for their physical health.Due to the popularity of work out, mental incitement, and preparing of these dogs, they are usually high upkeeps.With their pretty strong-willed breed always striving to learn new tricks.Thus, making this dog best for active families or people having enough time for training. Nutrition and Diet Requirements1,500 calories of kibble cups required.Having large builds, these dogs demand a huge intake of food.

You can find them everywhere. Many amazing facts and features make them unique and different from other mammals on earth. Their bright colors, sound, parenting qualities, high metabolic rate, and exceptional features make them unique, which everyone thinks are true.", "word-count": 655, "body": "You can see birds everywhere. I don't think so any place where you can't find birds. These are amazing and cutest creatures that have adapted to live in every type of environment. They exist in woodlands, deserts, mountains, rivers, caves, public places, and even seas. Now we shall discuss the eight facts about birds that everyone thinks are true.GroupsEnvironmentalists divide the species of birds into two groups: Palaeognathae' and the other is 'Neognathae.' Palaeognathae or old jaws birds initially grew in the era of Cenozoic. After this time dinosaurs vanished from the earth. Ostriches, emus, and kiwis are related to this class. The other group is Neognathae or new jaws birds whose roots had traced back to the era of Mesozoic. All the other birds are associated with it.Birds evolved from DinosaursHave you heard about dinosaurs? Which have been banished from the planet now. Physical structures support the theory that dinosaurs had changed into birds. But, one thing to remember that this theory doesn't apply to all the species of dinosaur, or even every subclass of dinosaurs also. The dinosaurs have evolved into birds are called theropods.Birds attract through Sound and ColorIt is one of the facts that the  are attracted through sounds and colors. God has bestowed them with a lively appearance and magnificent sound. They are fairly small creatures and, they need a consistent way to detect one another during mating season. Due to these perching birds have grown with a complex assortment of songs, trills, and whistles, with which they can attract others in the dense timberland canopies where they would otherwise be nearly indistinguishable. Through bright and shining colors and glorious sound, they serve a signaling function to state their supremacy over other males.Better Parents Than OthersThere are a wide variety of parenting behaviors almost all the creatures. God has bestowed parenting care to nearly all individuals. Birds also become good parents than other creatures in animals' kingdom. For instance, the malleefowl of Australia lays eggs in contaminated patches of shrubbery, which delivers them a natural source of heat, and the fledglings are entirely on their own after hatching. But all birds do not become good parents like the cuckoo bird, which lays its eggs in other birds' nest. Furthermore, they leave their eggs for development, hatching, and feeding to total strangers.High Metabolic RateAs everyone knows that, the smaller warm-blooded creatures have a high metabolic rate. One of the best indicators of metabolic rate in a creature is its heartbeat. You know, a chicken which is doing nothing but its heart is beating at around 250 beats per minute, while in the same position the heart rate of a resting hummingbird measures up to 600 beats per minute.Birds have no bladdersIt is one of the facts about birds to make them more frivolous many of them do not have bladders to store urine. They are different from other creatures rather than producing liquid urine to get rid of body waste they produce a white substance.Various features of birdsBirds are a great attraction for human beings. There are many diversities and their splendid features. God has creatures a huge variety of birds with unique qualities some are Short tail birds, , some have long beaks, etc. The long beaks birds look more beautiful among others. Their beaks are beautiful but, they help them to do various tasks like finding food easily. The only bird which has nostrils at the end of its beak is the magnificent kiwi. It helps it for sniffing food, such as caterpillars and pests on the ground.Biggest bird on the Earth The biggest bird ever existed on the Earth is the earthbound elephant bird, which is now has vanished. It has weighed around 1000 lb. interestingly, seven huge ostrich eggs would fit inside one elephant bird's egg. This bird had died around 400 years ago, but people still have discovered the pieces of their tough-shelled eggs even today.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/pets/8-facts-about-birds-everyone-thinks-are-true.html"},

This results in further damaging their health making them extremely drowsy and usually, dehydration is also caused in their body.", "word-count": 510, "body": "It is natural with animals as they draw nearer to the end they stop eating or drinking. This is mainly because they are too tired and also very sick and hence do not possess so much of the energy to put in an extra effort to process the food and drink. This results in further damaging their health making them extremely drowsy and usually, dehydration is also caused in their body.Another major symptom that can be observed is the high weakness that the cat is enduring in their body. This is because the cat’s body is usually fighting from so much of illness internally which we don’t even realize and hence that makes the cat very tired and fed-up. The cat will usually just keep laying in one corner of the house and literally do nothing. Another thing that can be recognized is that cats will intend on sleeping too much during this period. Another way to observe is to notice the cat’s hind legs and this is one of the reasons of not being much active or roaming around the house. Cats are usually the type of animals that tend to have a very high and warm body temperature. The body temperature for the cats do not drastically fall before their death however, slowly and gradually the overall body temperature starts to decrease. This can be taken into consideration if you examine the extremities of your cat that are the ears and the paws, they tend to become cooler and cooler as they draw nearer to end and in most cases drop below a hundred degrees. Cats who are very sensitive pets they are very much delighted in keeping themselves neat and clean. When they have the strength and are healthy they give a lot of attention and time to themselves in order to groom themselves. When the cats come colder to the end of life they usually become very messy and very dirty. This can be clearly understood since they lack the internal energy they decide not to use any further in grooming or cleaning themselves. Another important thing is that there are very high chances that they even develop a detectable odor. This type of odor usually comes up due to the very simple reason that since cats are very ill they build up these toxins in their body. The common culture of the jungle is that whoever is weak and small becomes the easy target for other animals to hunt. A similar thing happens with cats. As they come nearer to their death they usually go into the hiding. A major reason is that before they were healthy and possess all the strength to defend themselves. However, now with a lack of energy, strength, and the ability to fight back or defend themselves, they are easy targets to get hunted. Hence they prefer to go into hiding and stay there so that they can be safe and can die in peace without the threat of any other animal taking advantage and killing them. Read more about", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/pets/6-signs-your-cat-is-dying.html"},
{"heading": "5 Things Your Small Business Website Needs to Make it Pop", "author": "Norm McLaughlin", "description": "So you’ve started a small business and you need a great website to turn your dreams into reality. But you don’t want to be just one more player in the marketplace. You want to stand out from your competition and begin to hit your goals from day one.", "word-count": 1063, "body": "Your website is the shop window to you and your business. So just how do you go about making it pop? Here are five things your small business website needs.Great ContentThe copy on your website needs to be substantial, well-written and comprehensive. The content of your site will be read not only by potential customers but also by internet search engines and needs to clearly articulate what you offer. It should contain key words and terms related to your business but these mustn’t be ‘stuffed’ into the text such that it reads in an artificial way.You may be able to think of sentences you’ve read on websites where the words seemed to be in a curious order, or where a similar phrase was repeated over and over. You need to avoid this so that the text on your site reads perfectly naturally. This makes better reading for your prospective clients but also for the increasingly intelligent bots which will crawl your site and choose where to position it on search engine results pages.When writing the copy for your website, it’s good to imagine that you are talking directly to a potential customer. You’ll want to clearly convey that you know what you’re talking about but not in such a way that it is filled with jargon or false claims. In order to do this well you’ll need to think about your target market and the people you want to reach, in order that you can speak their language.Vocabulary and phraseology which are most commonly used by the younger generations are less likely to strike a chord with an older demographic. Conversely the language spoken by the older demographic may not engage with younger people. You need to understand your audience in order to communicate with them effectively.Strong ImagesWebsite design trends change with time and it’s not always easy to maintain that state-of-the-art look. However, the use of strong images is imperative whatever the design of your site and however those images are presented.Ideally, the images on your site should be a mix of photographs which display the subject material, people photos, and then any other appropriate images. In my case the subject material would be computers in various states of repair or disrepair. In your case, it will be whatever best illustrates the activity of your business. The most striking photographs are often those of individuals and, in choosing what types of people to display you’ll also need to think about your target demographic. As you choose your people photographs, consider the emotions you want their faces to convey and how this engages with the overall message you want to communicate in each section of your website.The Personal TouchHave you ever found yourself seeking out a service, comparing different websites, and wanting to know more about the company or the individual who would potentially provide this service for you? Many websites say very little about the people who actually make up the business. However, the personal touch can be a game changer, especially if the client is seeking a service which involves someone coming into their home.You should include biographical snapshots of your personnel, as these create a more personal connection with the client. Customer retention is also key to your growth and the more personal the contact, the more likely you are to retain the customer into the future.CredibilityWhen I launched my own business and began looking at the websites of my competitors, I was amazed by how many of them claimed to be the best. I read quote after quote such as voted number 1 for computer repairs or the preferred onsite computer repair service or the top Sydney computer repair, and the list goes on.It is important to convey that you can accomplish what the customer requires. However, self-congratulation, together with unfounded claims and promises, is not the way to go. Much better is to let your customers speak for you and so it’s important to include client testimonials on your website. You can begin to gather these testimonials from previous clients by creating a survey for them to complete following completion of your first job for them.It’s a good idea to have the words of previous customers prominently displayed on your home page, your landing pages, and on a dedicated testimonials page. Of course you can always be accused of creating false testimonials and the best way to counter this accusation is to use verbatim quotes from a variety of different clients, even if those quotes contain grammatical and spelling errors. I would however use testimonials which are free of such errors on your home page and landing pages.Even better is to have your testimonials collated on an independent review site, which is above accusation. One disadvantage of doing it this way is that you may not want potential clients clicking through to an external site as they may get distracted there and not return to your site.As a trusted and professional business your website should also include some sort of privacy policy, website terms of use, and business terms and conditions. It should also contain your business registration details.Clear Calls to Action There’s no point in having a beautiful website with outstanding content if you don’t make it clear to the potential customer what you’d like them to do as a result of their visit to your site. This may seem obvious to you but it’s important to provide a clear pathway for the customer.You should envisage how you foresee a would-be client navigating your site. Whether they remain on the landing page where they started, or navigate through different pages, they should be continually presented with calls to action. These can be in the form of clickable buttons with wording such as Call Now, Book Now or Find Out More. Your contact details should also be clearly visible, particularly through whatever is your preferred means of contact. You can place your full contact details in the footer of your site and then use clickable buttons in various positions on the different pages with your telephone number or email address.Hopefully this brief overview has helped you clarify some of the important elements you should incorporate into your small business website. An attractive, articulate website which speaks authentically to the prospective client, and makes clear what you’d like them to do, will give you the edge over your competitors.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/online-promotion/5-things-your-small-business-website-needs-to-make-it-pop.html"},

Many veterinarians are of the view that dogs should be given “dog digestive supplements” every day, to keep their stomachs in the best condition.This article is for you if you have ever wondered: “What should I give to my dog for his upset stomach?”Following is the rundown of some common causes and symptoms of upset stomach in dogs, along with possible treatment to keep your dog healthy.According to many sources, such as wondercide.com, there are a number of causes that can trigger a problem in a dog’s stomach. In most cases, an upset stomach is an indication of a much deeper and complex condition in dogs.Some of the commonly-occurring dog digestive system issues and their remedies are given below:It is a fairly common problem found in dogs, also known to be Gastroesophageal reflux disease. This condition is caused by stomach acid when it pushes past the barrier of the stomach and enters the esophageal canal.Many times during an episode of acid reflux, it will seem as if your dog is about to throw up because of the gurgling sounds his stomach will make. Most of the time, actual regurgitation (the act of vomiting or throwing up) will happen because the stomach acids will be contained in the esophageal passage. In the absence of apparent symptoms of vomit, there will be other noticeable signals for stomachache and gastrointestinal distress.When you suspect that your dog is facing acid reflux problem, trace some of the following symptoms to confirm the condition:Doctors mostly prescribe antacids to ease off acid reflux, but it can be treated by changing dietary habits. Opting low acidity foods, serving smaller quantities periodically, and avoiding fatty food can help your dog in coping with this condition.According to Pet MD, one of the best things to give to a dog ailing with an upset stomach is bland food. Animal medicine practitioners and canine nutritionists suggest a bland diet that is similar to chicken and rice. It is easier for an upset stomach to break down a diet that consists of low-fat protein and grain with minimal sugar content. This will result in low-production o stomach acids because the stomach does not need much of that to digest this food. In turn, this will ease off acid reflux.Indigestion is one of the most commonly found causes of an upset stomach. It is defined by any gastric distress brought up by the assimilation and digestion of food. In simple terms, it means that whatever your dog ate did not come in terms with his digestive system. Common symptoms of indigestion include heartburn and nausea, symptoms that are also related to acid reflux.It is not easy to detect nausea in dogs, mostly it is characterized by vomiting and gagging. Severe nausea can be manifested in the form of diarrhea. Indigestion is also caused by the additional production of stomach acid which is used to breakdown food and commence digestion.It is common in the canine digestive system that the stomach acid is introduced too rapidly, which overwhelms the digestive system. In turn, the system tries to alleviate the quantity of acid by regurgitation, gas pain, bloating, and canine diarrhea.The best remedy for dog indigestion complexities is the canine probiotic chews. Add a spoonful of Greek yogurt in the dog’s food will introduce healthy bacteria in his stomach. It will help in indigestion and other related issues. These probiotics are also extremely helpful in fighting off viruses and bacteria lurking around the gut of the dog’s digestive tract. They also aid in increasing brain functioning in mammals and sufficiently raising energy levels, combatting symptoms of an upset stomach like lethargy.Gastritis indicates the inflammation of the stomach, so it location-based. This digestive condition is prevalent in the dogs that are brought on by foraging and consumption of food that is not suitable for growing canines. There are a number of symptoms that can trigger such involuntary stomach conditions like gastritis. The most common culprits for this issue are spoiled food, food allergies, food intolerance, a virus, etc.It could be an isolated incident, but in most cases of dogs with upset stomachs, gastritis indicates the presence of some deeper digestive ailment. It includes bloating, gas, vomiting, diarrhea, and loss of appetite.One of the most favorite remedies for gastritis among dog-lovers and vets is ginger and ice cubes. Ice cubes are a great way to settle upset stomachs in dogs because the cooling effects of ice will act as a natural anti-inflammatory. Also, ginger naturally has anti-inflammatory properties. According to Missing Link. periodic small doses of ginger act as a natural medication against inflammation and soothes the stomach from the adverse effects of bloating and gas pain.It is obvious (and you have already noticed) that stomach acid is one of the common factors behind an upset stomach in dogs. Ulcers are the wounds of the stomach caused by excessive production of stomach acid that starts to digest the protective lining of the stomach. This is the worst-case scenario as the acid starts eating the walls, painful pores come in the form of small holes in the stomach tissues.Unbridled medication and infections are some of the most common causes of ulcers. Other pre-existing digestive issues such as gastritis and acid reflux aggravates and makes them worse.Two apparent symptoms of ulcers are bloody vomiting and hard dark stool in dogs. Still, many signs of ulcers are not visible in dogs, common visible phenomena are weight loss, indications of fatigue and lethargy, and an affinity to avoid food.Eating causes an increase in stomachache, as propounded by K9 of Mine, that’s why dogs suffering from ulcers are usually wary of eating food. In severe cases, ulcers are merely mitigated and never fully healed, but in most cases, there is a timeline of six to eight weeks based on the damage and medication. Although your dog will be prescribed by antibiotics to heal the wounds and painkillers to dull the pain, eating will still be painful.Dogs who suffer from ulcers are often recommended canned pumpkin because of the low-glycemic properties of pumpkin. It won’t aggravate the abscess and its flavor will be proved to be irresistible by the dog.The way we humans catch bacterial and viral diseases by exposing ourselves to microscopic crawlers, your dog can also harbor disease-causing viruses and pathogens of its own. Among the lot, viruses are more responsible for ailments related to canines. Also, there is the potential inside that aggravates stomach related issues. In the same way, parasites reside in your dog’s intestinal tract like intruders. Both can cause drastic changes in the nature and functioning of the stomach.Fecal matter is the home of viruses and parasites. If you suspect that your dog has caught some viral or parasitical disease, there are chances that it has ingested contaminated feces. There are other instances where dogs catch these microbes but generally, your dog needs to take contaminated substance orally to catch the adverse effects.Parvovirus is one of the most commonly-founded virus among the dogs. Vets often recommend that the dogs need to be vaccinated regularly to curb the proliferation of the diseases. The real danger lies in the ability of Parvovirus to attack the small intestines of a healthy dog. It can enter the bloodstream of the dog, and from there, attack bone marrow, white blood cells, and then the vital organs such as the heart and lungs.Worms are common culprits behind the ailments in dogs. They live in the intestines and feed off nutritious food that your dog needs to absorb and digest. This leads to an upset stomach because worms deprive your dog of essential nutrients, apparent in the shape of weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, fever, etc.Dog’s stool will be the ultimate sign of what is going on inside his guts, both in case of worms and Parvovirus. Rush to the veterinarian as soon as possible if you detect bloody diarrhea in your dog, it is because bloody stool is the sign of nascent Parvo. Still, it is easily treatable when detected in the earlier stage. Yet, vaccination is the best method to keep your dog from the claws of such a dangerous illness.The same way, worms can be seen in your dog’s stool but if you cannot see them, the vet can suggest bringing a sample for lab analysis. Worms are also treatable without any hassle. Generally, antibiotics are given orally for a week or injected through a shot.Read more about", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/pets/dog-upset-stomach-what-to-give-for-vomiting.html"},

{"heading": "The Depressing Fate of Most Anime Best Friends", "author": "Daniel Ryan", "description": "I've seen Evangelion, Elfen Lied, and some of Gantz. I'm watching Claymore right now, and I want to know about anime that is even more depressing.", "word-count": 569, "body": "Most anime protagonists have a friend who stands by them through thick and thin. However, they often find themselves in life-threatening situations and never get any credit for their sacrifices. It is quite common for anime to kill the best friends to give the protagonists the emotional push necessary to reach their potential. Even those who don’t lose their lives are stuck in a thankless role and are never appreciated. Krillin from Dragon Ball is an excellent example. Although, he trains under Master Roshi along with Goku and is just as hardworking. As the show progresses, it becomes obvious that Krillin will never be as good as Goku. However, his weakness does serve as a metric to measure Goku’s extraordinary abilities.Source:Krillin is undoubtedly not the weakest character in the series. He is, in fact, remarkable when compared with other human martial artists. But, the villains on Dragon Ball are rarely human, so Krillin struggles when he fights them. He often needs to be rescued by Goku, who ends up saving everyone. The contrast between the protagonist and his friend helps creators make the lead character appear extraordinary, which is important for the plot. However, Krillin is a bit luckier than most of the protagonist’s best friends since he went to live until the last installment of the series. He was even married and rarely seemed unhappy. Unfortunately, most of the protagonist’s best friends are not as lucky as him. Either they fade into the background or die just for the character development of the main character.One great example of such a best friend is Naru Osaka from Sailor Moon, who had a much more depressing end than Krillin. When the series started, she used to be an important character since she was very close to Usagi. On several occasions, she was in the spotlight, with the most memorable of them being when she fell in love with Nephrite, a villain in the series. However, her limelight did not last long. As soon as Nephrite was defeated, her time in the spotlight ended. She was later paired up with one of the supporting characters, which seemed to have been done to give a sense of closure to the story.In the subsequent seasons, her roles diluted further, and she was reduced to just another minor character on the show. Even though she made many appearances, they were mostly short-lived and were not intended to give her an opportunity to make a lasting impression. By the time Sailor Moon Sailor Stars, the series’s final season was released, she had already faded into the background. It is almost as if she never really existed. Krillin and Naru are just two of many anime best friends who were just a tool for creators to make the protagonist look extraordinary.Although, some of the anime best friends did end up becoming an important part of the series with time. Killua from Hunter x Hunter is a great example. Whenever Gon and Killua are with each other, one can’t say for sure who the protagonist is. Killua does not play second fiddle and is an important part of the cast. Bakugo from My Hero Academia is another lucky character that did not fade into the background. In fact, with each season, the creators have given him more opportunities to express himself. However, these two characters are exceptions, and usually, the anime best friends have a sad end.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/newsletters/the-depressing-fate-of-most-anime-best-friends.html"},

It offers a large number of movies and web series to keep you entertained, but if you have been using Netflix for a long, even that large library may get you bored. However, Netflix is not the end of the world. If you are looking for some fresh binging experience and content, you can consider buying a subscription to any other video streaming service. There are a lot of video streaming services available in the market these days, but all these many options can leave you confused, so we have got you covered. In this article, we have listed the best alternative video streaming services to Netflix. Let’s find the best choices for you.Source:Amazon Prime VideoAmazon Prime Video is one of the best alternatives to Netflix. It has a variety of movies and web series of various genres, and along with that, you can find content on this app for every age group that makes it suitable for everyone. Shows like The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, The Man In The High Castle, The Boys, and Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan are a few of the many amazing shows available on Amazon Prime Video and good enough examples to show the richness of content on this platform. A subscription to Amazon Prime Video can be availed with an Amazon Prime membership that costs $12.99 per month. There are a lot of other benefits also included with Amazon Prime membership, such as free shipping on selected products sold by Amazon, access to Amazon’s Prime Reading service, subscription to Prime Music, etc. However, if you are looking to buy a subscription to Amazon Prime Video only, it will cost you $8.99 per month.HBO MaxIf a collection that includes popular TV shows like Westworld, Game of Thrones, and Barry, sitcoms like Friends, The Big Bang Theory, South Park, and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, and dramas like Doctor Who and Pretty Little Liars, excites you, then look no further than buying a subscription of HBO Max. HBO Max is not just an alternative to Netflix, but it is one of the best streaming services available in the market right now. HBO Max is relatively new in the market as it is an upgraded version of an already existing streaming service HBO, but that makes it just better. HBO Max features all those shows and films which are available on HBO, and it boasts that content also which you cannot find on HBO. This service allows you to watch old and new movies from Warner Bros. and lets you stream content from WarnerMedia’s other cable TV channels, which include TNT, TBS, TruTV, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network, and CNN. Talking about the pricing, the monthly subscription of HBO Max costs you $14.99, which may look expensive, but it is justified for the content it offers.CrackleIf you feel like you have spent enough on the subscription of various streaming services to keep yourself entertained, then probably Crackle is the place where you want to stop and take a look. This service features more than 150 feature-length movies and 75 TV shows. Most of the movies and TV shows which appear on this streaming service are those, which are critically appreciated and considered “classic.” The next thing about this streaming service might leave you surprised as all this amazing content is available for free. Free availability of such large and appreciated content is something that makes Crackle outstanding on our list. However, one thing that you might not like about this website is the advertisements, but that should be justified as everything else is free.HuluHulu has to be there if we are talking about the top streaming services. Popular shows like Seinfeld, ER, and Futurama, original series like The Handmaid’s Tale are the prime attractions of this popular streaming service. You can find episodes of many popular TV shows getting available on Hulu right after they are aired on TV, making it different from other media streaming services. Talking about the price, the ads-including version of Hulu is way too cheaper than other famous streaming services as you can buy it for $5.99 per month only. However, the ad-free plan, which comes with some additional benefits, costs you $11.99 per month. With growing popularity, we can expect Hulu to mark its presence in more countries other than the US and Japan only.Disney PlusDisney Plus is one of the fastest-growing video streaming services across the world, and it has been rising as a very close rival to Netflix. Along with featuring top-quality movies, original series, and TV shows, it features a large library also which is designed for kids, and that is making the first choice among families. Most of the famous franchises like Pixar, Star Wars, and Marvel Cinematic Universe movies are available on Disney Plus, and that only gets better with the additional collection of Disney movies and shows. The price for the subscription of Disney Plus is also one appealing factor about it, as it is one of the cheapest but great streaming services available in the market right now. If you are looking to buy a monthly subscription to Disney Plus, it will cost you $6.99 a month, while the annual subscription is available for $69.99. Streaming services have become a synonym for entertainment these days, and there are a lot of options to choose from. While Netflix still stays the market leader in the field, many other new services are also growing rapidly.

{"heading": "Why a Vegeta Like Character Is Crucial for Every Shonen?", "author": "Daniel Ryan", "description": "Even though he only appears in the Dragon Ball series, every shonen has a Vegeta. Once the hero has outgrown their \"Krillin,\" or the weaker \"best friend\" character, it's time for the Vegeta to step up to the plate.", "word-count": 475, "body": "Dragon Ball is arguably the best series of all time. Although several factors can be attributed to its success, none of them is as impactful as its strong group of characters. Every single one of the characters has an interesting backstory. Although Goku is the protagonist, some fans prefer Vegeta over him, and they have a good reason to feel that way. His character development is fascinating, and his transition from an outright villain to an anti-hero is intriguing. At one point, he was an antagonist for Goku, who later turned into a rival and then a friend. Even though Vegeta himself would never admit it, that’s what every Dragon Ball fan knows. On close observation, one realizes that although he makes his appearance in the Dragon Ball series, every Shonen anime has a Vegeta. Source:An excellent example of this can be Sasuke Uchiha from Naruto. Although unlike Vegeta, he started off as Naruto’s friend and a rival, he later became a rogue ninja and an enemy. Although Naruto’s dream was to become the Hokage, Sasuke was the first person he truly thought of as a rival. He strived hard to surpass him. It is not surprising that Sasuke too saw Naruto as his biggest rival and aspired to defeat him someday. Sasuke’s character development is quite similar to Vegeta and although he started off as a rival and then became a villain. But, at the end of the day, he found his way back to the right side, just like Vegeta. Katsuki Bakugo is another interesting example. Although he was Izuku’s childhood friend, he started bullying him as years went on. Bakugo was gifted with an explosive quirk, which made his future seem very bright. He was very clear about his goals right from his childhood. The series made the difference between Izuku and Bakugo quite clear. Izuku fought to save people while Bakugo would save people to show off his skills and special quirk; they were the two sides of the same coin. Although Bakugo hates Izuku and has no respect for him, with time, he realizes his mistakes. He then went on to understand that although he was born Quirkless, Izuku was a true hero who deserved to inherit One for All. Like Vegeta and Goku, Izuku and Bakugo had quite similar relationships, which helped the former immensely.Killua Zoldyck from Hunter x Hunter is also quite similar to Vegeta in various aspects. It is evident with these examples that almost all Shonen has a Vegeta who is extremely important not just for the plot but also for the protagonist’s character development. He helps the main character grow physically and emotionally. Therefore, a Vegeta is an integral part of Shonen manga/anime, which deserves all the appreciation and love it gets.Vegetas like Killua, Bakugo, and Sasuke make sacrifices that, thankfully, are recognized and respected.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/newsletters/why-a-vegeta-like-character-is-crucial-for-every-shonen.html"},

You can easily buy such a loving pet from your nearby pet shops or instantly from a puppy owner who is an expert dog breeder. It is highly recommended to buy a dog when he is a little puppy, as it can give you a huge sum of time to socialize with them and getting them trained. Moreover, buying from pet dog owners, not from those dealing in wholesale but those who keep them as their family members is usually the best way to bring the new dog to your home. Why buy dogs from dog owners?Well, the dogs bought directly from dog owners who keep them as pets are usually the best way. At home, dogs are also less exposed to life-threatening diseases and prone to other dog conditions because they are kept in an environment away from other animals, unlike those in puppy mills or pet shops where these animals are kept in herds. By consulting directly with a dog owner, you will have the following advantages:   How to find the best puppy seller in your location?Finding pet dog owners in and around your area can be difficult sometimes, though. The best course to take would be to check in with your local dog club if your place has any. The regional authorities should be able to provide you with the information if they have dog clubs in terms of news broadcasts or local newspapers. If not, try contacting national dog clubs of your country and ask them if they have members in the area you are living in. You can also buy from pet stores but the drawback is there is no proper care is taken in puppy stores and dogs can prone to many diseases. There are very few stores that take the time to care for the dog or other pets they are selling. If I talk about Sheepadoodle, Bernadoodle, and Goldendoodles from the poodle family they are usually small loving dogs, and usually, they are overlooked in regards to keeping them well cared for, especially in large pet stores that sell a lot of different sort of dog breeds. Most of the time, their staff do not pay much attention to dog safety and they are not well experienced in dog nurturing. When buying from pet stores, look around and ask questions that you have in your mind. Pet dogs from most pet stores usually come from wholesalers who breed dogs in huge numbers, distributing them to different pet shops all over the country. Dogs originating from these sources were exposed to greater risks of sickness and stress. Imagine being a young little rat placed in a cramped cage with other dogs, moving from place to place, and finally settled in a pet shop whose staff do not have a clue how to properly care for you. You will probably get sick too. If you were fortunate enough to find one of such types of shops, then it is perfectly okay to buy your pet dog there. Just remember, when buying a pet dog, you will have an easier time managing and keeping them if they came from a place that truly cared for their well-being from the moment they were born. Is there any trustworthy dog owner to buy a companion dog? Rebecca is one of the greatest dog owners who are running Doubleudoodle for many years. She is the one who nurtures  and dogs, taking care of their diet, and indulging them in exercise. At Doubleudoodle she and her team grow dogs, especially Sheepadoodle, Bernadoodle and Goldengoodles, and treat them like family members until they get to your home. Even after purchasing dogs from them, you can keep consulting with them about the health and diet of dog-like friends, not like puppy mills where after the purchase the entire responsibility will be on your shoulders.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/pets/a-brief-guide-to-buying-a-puppy-for-your-home.html"},

Although many of the scenes in the new season bring attention to how outdated many tropes and clichés there are in anime, fans cannot help but love the nostalgia of the series.", "word-count": 647, "body": "Trained from his childhood to become a living weapon, Tatsuya Shiba from The Irregular at Magic High School is a cold and calculated warrior that must not be underestimated. One can make the mistake of thinking that he is weak because of his quiet demeanor, but nothing can be further from the truth. Tatsuya is a dangerous fighter with impressive powers that are often hidden behind his chilly demeanor. Although he is an important character, there are many mysteries surrounding him and his powers. Today we look at the aspects of his personality and his qualities that make him the fierce warrior and the talented magician.Source:Tatsuya’s MagicAlthough Tatsuya’s magic and his abilities make him seem invincible sometimes, surprisingly, he cannot always use his full potential. The activation of his potential and powers depend a lot on his sister Miyuki. He is limited in the use of his Psion reserves because of the Pledge created by Touka Tsukuba, which acts as a seal. Since Miyuki’s powers are used for the Pledge’s limiting power, she also suffers from the drain of her magic reserves. However, when the situation demands, Miyuki can temporarily allow his brother to use Psion reserves, which gives Tatsuya unbelievable powers. Tatsuya’s EmotionsTatsuya’s powers to use only regrowth and decomposition magic was not acceptable in his family of prized magicians. To help Tatsuya use any latent skills that he might have, his aunt and mother used Outer Systematic Magic to alter his consciousness. Their experiment was done to add an Artificial Magic Calculation area; however, Tatsuya’s childhood experiment came at a high price despite getting so much access to more powers. The experiments’ alterations clashed with his limbic system, and his ability to form strong bonds with people was harmed. Moreover, the family’s expectation that he will now finally wield strong enough magic was also not fulfilled, which means that he ended up losing an important aspect of his personality for little improvement. But his limited emotional range made him ideal for military and combat matters. It ended up making him the cold and taciturn warrior with a chilly demeanor that he is known for. Ninjutsu MasterIn the world of magicians, where physical abilities can be bolstered artificially by magic having physical skills might seem unnecessary. But Tatsuya was able to get out of many dangerous situations using Ninjutsu. He is the student of Yakumo Kononoe, a Ninjutsu expert. Tatsuya is so skilled that he can inflict significant damage on his adversaries without using his magical powers. Moreover, his training made him more aware of his surroundings, which proved crucial in many of his fights. High Psion CountThe artificial Magic Calculation Area limits Tatsuya’s ability to use Systematic Spells. Although it puts him at a disadvantage, he has the highest Psion count, giving him access to Gram Demolition counter magic and resistance to powerful magic attacks. It allows him to compress Psion particles into a cannonball that can blow away magic activation sequences, hence demolishing every record of magic. Gram Demolition is dangerous because physical obstacles cannot slow it since it lacks a physical presence; moreover, it repels the effects of Cast Jamming. Therefore, this hazardous attack that requires Psion Count gives Tatsuya incredible powers and puts him ahead of all his enemies.Supernatural UserTatsuya’s ability as a Supernatural Magic User gives him a significant advantage over his adversaries, who need more time to activate their sequences. Although Supernatural powers come at a cost and affect the Systematic magic versatility, it is the price worth paying. Even though the Supernatural Power users face prejudice, they are still a step ahead in certain aspects. However, Tatsuya prefers CAD even though he is well aware of the advantages of Supernatural Powers because his Prions are more effective this way. CADs are also more stable than Supernatural Power; therefore, it is understandable that Tatsuya prefers it over his other ability.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/newsletters/the-irregular-at-magic-high-school-what-makes-tatsuya-shiba-special.html"},

McClane visits his family after a long time, but he soon realizes that he is the only one who can save the hostages held up by the terrorists in a skyscraper in Los Angeles city.Did the plot generate some interest in you? Yes? Well, in that case, you must not think that having Netflix will give you access to all the Die Hard movies. You need to watch it somewhere else. Don’t worry; I am here to help you.Where to Watch the first Die Hard Movie?You can watch the movie on either HBO or its sister platform HBO Max. You can also choose to watch it on Amazon Prime if you wish to. If you have Amazon Fire TV in your home, then in that case, please download the HBO app on your device.If you are well aware of all the OTT platforms, then you are in some luck.You can watch Die Hard on Hulu, Vudu, or Cinemax as well. Having said, I think you should go for HBO Max directly because plenty of interesting content is due to arrive there; one of them is an upcoming Patty Jenkins film Wonder Woman 1984.What to do if you live in the United States?If you live in the United States, you are unlikely to find a Die Hard movie in your Netflix album. In that case, as I said before, go for HBO/HBO Max option.However, you can also watch it (and other classic action films) on Hulu with a special offer that just amounts to around $6.00 per month. Please do not bother to do any of that if you are a premium subscriber of Amazon Prime.Now, people living in other countries can opt for the Netflix route if they have the option.Nevertheless, in case none of the options works out for you, you can use the techniques of VPN. VPN will let you access the Netflix album that is available in a different country. However, you must be aware of the risks involved in that.

As reported by the eSports tournament platform, Microsoft acquired Smash.gg on December 2.Initially, Smash.gg came into existence in 2015 as a program for eSports events. The services offered by Smash.gg were amplified to other titles other than Nintendo’s Super Smash Bros; however, it is still closely tied to the fighting genre. Not only this, but its range of tools support professional organizers and grassroots, payments, management, and analytics.Source:According to a statement by Smash.gg, their primary objective was to build enthusiasm for eSports and come up with games that people love to play. “We are excited to expand our reach by joining hands with Microsoft. It’ll not only help strengthen the existing relationships but explore fresh opportunities,” Smash.gg mentioned.Further, an ex-employee of Smash.gg, Matthew Zaborowski, now the manager of competitive operations for the Call of Duty League, tweeted that he is thrilled by the news of Microsoft acquiring Smash.gg.The news of buying Smash.gg was confirmed by Microsoft via MSN Esports Twitter account, mentioning that it’ll bring further support and opportunities for the organization.The possession of the Smash.gg eSports platform might seem like an unexpected event for Microsoft; however, the constant expansion signals further diversification. Not only this, but the company can introduce Smash.gg to fresh audiences via the Xbox platform, its MSN eSports franchise, or even the developer tools like Playfab.For the most part, Microsoft has a positive picture in the gaming scene with its Xbox stage. Yet, that additionally accompanies hatred in some gaming networks, following its choice to take down the Mixer live-streaming stage prior in 2020. Notably, Microsoft was attempting to build the Mixer live-streaming stage as an alternative to Amazon’s Twitch and Google’s YouTube services.In any case, for Smash.gg, it’s a general decision, with the organization already suggesting the pandemic had affected its main concern. It expressed “heaps of discussions” were in progress to keep up development in the midst of bits of gossip about a conclusion, including “discussions about obtaining or combination with services.”It seems like Microsoft was that ideal accomplice, conceivably saving the stage and putting it at the center of attention close by its more extensive gaming portfolio.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/newsletters/smashgg-esports-tournament-platform-bought-by-microsoft.html"},

Examples include: Zimbabwe, Eritrea, Burundi, Liberia, Niger, Madagascar, Malawi, and AfghanistanMiddle-Income NationsSometimes called East Asian Tigers. The GDP per capita of these countries ranges between $1,025 to $12,475 per year. Middle-income countries earn 32% of the income although they just represent 69.5% of the total global population. They are Thailand. South Korea, Malaysia, China, Singapore, and Indonesia (Redvers 2012)High Income NationsTheir per capita GDP per year in most cases above $12,475.

They include the following; Europe, the United States, and JapanProblems Relating to the Policies of Growth Associated with High-Income Country, Focus of Major Public Policies Responsible for Addressing the Problems.More Read: High-Income Country Growth Policies.For these countries, the challenges to the growth of their economy are the attempt to continually push for a greater number of educated individuals who can design, invest, and used in advanced technologies, thus the ambition of their civic procedures that are growth-oriented is to move their supply aggregate curves towards the right (International Monetary &amp; Fund Financial Surveys, 2013). The major community plans aimed at meeting this goal are financial policies concentrated on assets, amongst investing in physical equipment and plant, human capital, and technology. They consequently know that to grow economically works best in a climate that is market-oriented economically and is stable. Because of this, they apply the policy of money in keeping inflation stable and low, in minimizing the risk of fluctuations in exchange rates and giving courage to international and domestic competitions (International Monetary &amp; Fund Financial Surveys, 2013).Middle-Income Countries Growth PoliciesPhysical and human capital, technology, together with the inventiveness of a market-based economic setting, demonstrated a capable growth stimulant (The World Bank. “World DataBank). These countries face problems like government legacy of economic control that can be removed only at a slow pace. In most of them, the financial and banking sectors are regulated heavily. The government has also selected some industries to get loans of low interest and government subsidy. The economies have realized that an increment in market-oriented motives for workers and firms adds value to faster growth (International Labour Organization. “Global Employment Trends for Youth 2013).More Read: Growth Policies for Low-Income CountriesMost of these economies don’t have legal, economic stability, and market-orientated organizations necessary for a productive ground for their growth in the domestic economy and attraction of foreign investment. World Bank is set to fight poverty and increase levels of income of these countries by 2030, however political instability hinders this achievement. The low-income economies are at a downside since any income received is immediately spent on basic needs like food (Nobelprize.org. “The Prize in Economics 1987). Failure to save leads to a lack of accumulation of capital and funds that can be loaned for investment in human and physical capital.ConclusionIn conclusion, the goal towards improving a nation is not basically increasing the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) but to try and increase the Gross Domestic Product per capita increasing the entire living standards of people (smith&amp; Todero, 2011). As seen since fiscal development, it can be attained at the equivalent of the nation through scheming policies that deepen capital, increase the productivity of workers, and lead to technology increment.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/politics/standard-of-living-essay.html"},

The two largest economic powers in the world are trying to control the Coronavirus narrative. The White House has accused China of misleading the world in downplaying the true threat of Covid 19. Chinese officials have criticized the U.S. for not taking their warnings seriously enough. China has always been open, transparent and responsible and kept reporting information on Covid-19 to WHO, and related countries and regions including the United States. If we had known about this a number of months earlier. It could have been contained to that one area in China where it started. And, certainly the world is paying a big price for what Chinese did. The important thing from the perspective of the Chinese government and therefore the Chinese Communist Party is for Beijing to seize and retain control over the narrative. The primary concerns of the party and Xi Jinping are always, in fact, domestic and a domestic audience.Donald Trump is also focused on winning over his domestic audience and how the Trump administration handles restarting the economy while balancing relations with China could become a key factor in the 2020 election. His departure from the traditional Republican Party was that he would renegotiate these trade deals that the United States had been had been abused and taken advantage of for decades by poor leadership. Leaders in both countries also need someone else to blame and someone to point the finger at. There's no question there's great power competition between the two countries right now, whether that's on a military level, on an economic level or now on this biological and health level, both nations are trying to be number one on the planet. Here's what's at stake as Trump attempts to take on China over the coronavirus pandemic. Both the Chinese Communist Party and President Trump have accused the other side of mismanaging the coronavirus pandemic. And China and the U.S. still remain at odds over where and how the virus originated. It's very clear that the origin point of this was in China. But the Chinese government has since started to spread all sorts of alternative theories for other locations that it might have started to. China and the U.S. have disputes over the source of the virus. China has been using social media to fire back at the U.S. What Trump is most desperate to do right now is to come up with an alternate theory for why he played down the virus so obviously on tape and in interviews throughout January and all February. Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus; and this is their new hoax. But this is really the worst attack we've ever had. This is worse than Pearl Harbour. This is worse than the World Trade Centre. There's never been an attack like this. The president ultimately is saying, look, it's not my fault. We were too slow. It's the Chinese government's fault. And it should have never happened. Covid 19 could have been stopped at the source in China. The virus originated in China. That's not up for debate. And we have questions, unanswered questions the international community does about what happened in those early days. We've seen the United States and China come to blows inside international organizations that we would have expected to function more effectively during this crisis. So we've seen the United States scuttled statements essentially out of theG7 and the U.S. and China disagreeing might lying in the U.N. Security Council as both tried to fashion statements about the coronavirus and the way forward as we see more corona virus deaths. And the numbers don't just go up, but they touch more and more people. A friend and a family member, a co-worker, you will see a battle over who to blame, how to target that anger. We have actively responded to the concerns of all the parties and strengthened cooperation with them. China has won time and made positive contributions to the global battle against the epidemic. We know that this is a global pandemic and this is the time for every country to work together to resolve that. To do that, you have to be honest and transparent. Over the last two years, the trade war between China and the U.S. has inflamed tensions between the two governments. The Chinese accused the U.S. of unfair tariffs on Chinese goods, and the U.S. side argued that China was cheating the international system through unfair trade practices and an institutionalized system of intellectual copyright theft. A truce in the trade war appeared in mid-January 2020, when the U.S. and China agreed to eliminate unfair trade practices and also to remove tariffs put in place by the Trump administration. This January, he finally signed the phase one of this China trade deal and more than almost anything else for his domestic political audience. This is a promise made. promise kept. As the Phase one trade agreement was being signed however, the outbreak of Coronavirus in China was raging. How the Trump administration and China react to the pandemic could affect the more than seven hundred and thirty billion in trade at stake between the two nations and the fate of the next stage of U.S. China trade talks. Well, the big question is what happens with the trade relationship? China and the United States have both taken some of the preliminary actions as part of this Phase one deal. What they really look like in practice are some import export changes to rules about meat that can be exported or vegetables that can be imported. They're buying a lot off arm products, but are they buying to the level that they were supposed to? They were going to buy 50 billion dollars worth. Coronavirus has changed everything. It's changed the economic situations of both countries. And right now, Trump is waiting to see if China will fulfil its obligation. I think that we're long overdue for a decoupling of sorts. You want to be careful that just because something is made in China doesn't mean that that's necessarily a bad thing. Trade is mutually beneficial. The catch is when something is a national strategic resource, such as cyber components or, you know, in this case, necessary medical supplies during a pandemic. You want to be careful about that. President Trump proclaimed the equalization processed with China over a year ago and the rest of the world didn't really respond very much to that. But Covid-19 has completely disrupted the global supply chain. It's simply a fact that China spawned that virus. That is a fact. China hid that virus for about two months. That is a fact behind the shield of the world trade.World Health Organization, prominent Republicans such as Josh Hawley and Tom Cotton have pushed for the United States to end its dependence on China for cheap retail products, technology and pharmaceuticals. And the Covid-19 outbreak has given even more fuel to this group of lawmakers. USA is going to see that process of decoupling not as signed by Donald Trump, but being pushed forward in a haphazard way in response to the way how the Chinese government has been responding to the crisis, a lot of people have sort of abandoned the idea months ago that there would be a phase two.  Coronavirus really puts the nail in the coffin and the idea that there would be any more phases to the trade deal, phase one is all USA is going to get at this point. I think the positions of people like Tom Cotton and Josh Hawley probably more closely resemble the Republican Party as a whole and even the nation as a whole when you look at both Democrats and Republicans. The polling suggests that the public really is souring on China, whether it's trade negotiations, but it's more about the coronavirus and the questions that remain and the frustration as the number of casualties, rate rises and people are left with a great anger about what happened. I think that U.S. China relations will sort of be used as a Rorschach test by leaders on both sides of the aisle. That is, if you already saw U.S. China relations as highly competitive and you already believe that the United States needed to decouple from China reducing its supply chain exposure, putting up protectionist measures, you're probably likely to see that as all the more true in this environment. Hopefully they're going to keep the deal. We'll see. They may not want to find out. The trade negotiations with China were already a key focus leading up to the2020 presidential election. Now, with a pandemic and high unemployment rocking the United States, trade is more important than ever. United States putting taxes on other countries where they've taken advantage, especially China. In the last Democratic presidential debate before Super Tuesday. A surprise policy issue appeared coronavirus. What I would do immediately is to restore the funding. He cut the funding for CDC. He(Donald Trump) tried to cut the funding for NIH. Democratic opponents went after President Trump's management of the Covid 19 outbreak, accusing him of failing to act quickly enough to slow the spread of Covid 19 within the US Democratic political action committees latched on to President Trump's actions and started their own public campaign to amplify what they saw as a slow and catastrophic response. The Democrats have their own challenge, and it's, the way to see it most clearly is to look at the campaign of Joe Biden. The warning signs were mounting in January, he was raising the alarm back then and so were others, including the intelligence the federal intelligence community. And as he's become the presumptive nominee. One of his very first ads was slamming Trump on China The U.S. already has more reported deaths from Covid-19 than any other country, and the economic damage continues to take its toll on the average American as the number of unemployed continues to rise. The president has been talking about this idea of extracting some kind of punishment from the Chinese for allowing the coronavirus to spread. How that would look, whether it would be enforceable, what the United States could even get out of that is anybody's guess at this point. But the question is whether the president pushes for that right now. We're up to, what, close to 10 trillion dollars we've had to appropriate in order to fight this this battle. So what's it look? The bill has to come due for China. I think one of the things you've got to look at is the motivation for Donald Trump and Xi Jinping to point the finger at the other guy and the other country. That's all about domestic politics, both in China and in the United States. Both leaders have a real political incentive to point the finger and place blame elsewhere, particularly in the United States as we're in this election year and dealing with the November election just around the corner now. Some in the U.S. have advocated for legal action against China over the outbreak. There exists no forum and no legal structure under which United States can seek reparations or financial recovery for a pandemic. And the state of Missouri has already filed a civil lawsuit against China in federal court. However, China's protected against lawsuits by sovereign immunity in response to this legal protection Senator Tom Cotton and Representative Dan Crenshaw recently introduced legislation that would allow Americans to sue China in federal court. U.S. politicians should stop shirking responsibilities and shifting blame. The U.S. Senate recently passed a bill that would require Chinese firms to be audited by U.S. regulators in order to be listed on U.S. stock exchanges. The virus and the pandemic spread are likely to collapse domestic and international policy because it is such a clear moment at which interconnectedness, globalization and U.S. China relations. But also U.S. relations with so many other countries will come to the fore as measures of United States preparedness for reactions to this historic pandemic threat. I think U.S. China relations are much more likely to be front and centre in the upcoming election than they were before. Exactly because of the coronavirus pandemic and its knock on effects for the United States and the world. What remains to be seen is whether Biden can communicate to voters in an effective way, how he would approach China in a different way, and whether then, on the other hand, Trump can defend successfully his very combative.Ref:-", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/politics/us-china-fight-over-covid-19.html"},

I think that UK prefers deeper cooperation with the United States. But Mr. Macron said: ‘Since 1995, France and the United Kingdom have stated clearly there is no situation in which a threat to one’s vital interests would not also be a threat to the other’s.’On the other hand, France and some EU nations started restoring dialogue with President Vladmir Putin, who controls the world largest nuclear arsenal.Macron and France are ready to be part and not only spectators in arms race but are the other European powers –Germany and Italy for example- ready to share in arms race? To be clear: Are the European powers ready to decrease their dependence on NATO for the sake of an EU military power? I think that in the near future, the European powers will still depend on NATO.

They are referred by many such as- Lab Created diamonds, CVD,  , etc.They are manufactured by using two processes- High Pressure High Temperature Methods and Chemical Vapor Deposition Methods. Now you might be wondering how a diamond can be grown into a lab? It starts with a treating a seed of another. Let us understand both the processes one by one.Lab grown diamonds are first treated under HPHT process. It is a process in which the seed of another existing diamond is inserted in the machinery and exposed to the temperature of 1500 Celsius and pressure of 1.5 million pounds per square inch in a chamber. The carbon around the seed gets melted and forms crystallised carbon. The cooling process is done to form a pure carbon diamond. Now let us learn how CVD process works? It usually starts with treating diamonds produced by the HPHT process. It is exposed to 800 degree Celsius inside a sealed container. The container has carbon rich gases which are ionized into plasma under extreme heat and pressure. As a result, the existing molecular bonds break leaving behind the pure carbon. It develops in a pure carbon diamond when the pure carbon then sticks to the Real Stones.The real diamonds are formed in the same extreme heat and pressure conditions in the earth's crustas a consequence of nature's actionsNow, we know that difference between lab grown and real diamonds is the place of origin.Still not convinced why lab grown diamonds is a responsible &amp; sustainable choice?

You work over your camera handling skills, camera settings skills, and you find out ways to work with various props, lights, subjects, and you also stretch your boundaries when more things like new  and accessories hit the market.There’s no full stop if you ask the question of what it takes to be a professional street photographer. Today in this article, we will be focusing particularly on street photography and the tips that you can use to become a professional street photographer.Good street photography is the ability to capture not just the subject, but the story that is making the ‘subject’ its subject.Street photography is not just a fling but a genre that is sweeping the photographers and the viewers off their feet. To become a professional street photographer - the rule of thirds, frames and margins, and proper utilization of idle space are all the basic rules a beginner and a professional need to follow. These rules are also something that should be implicated no matter what kind of professional photography style you are adopting.The aim of professional street photographers is always to capture the moment that conveys the same story that took place at that time.When you capture a group of friends being a professional street photographer - you are not capturing the people but you are capturing their expressions, their emotions, and the bonding that they are sharing. That’s the beauty of street photography!Consider street photography as a movie shot in one single frame that needs no movements, but something that captures authentic moments. This is contradictory to photography done in the studio where you capture the images in a more controlled surrounding. This is the kind of street photography where you capture the subject without their knowledge and without their consent. Here the expressions and the actions of the subject are more real and authentic.You are not required to instruct anything or make changes. The photo captured is more natural. By the name, you must have figured that it is another kind of street photography that is carried out without the onset of the subject. However, it's more of an aggressive kind!It is taken too close to the face in order to capture the startled or natural expressions of the subject’s face. This kind of street photography is one of the most creative and thoughtful styles of photography. Here, the professional street photographers make use of patterns and shapes of buildings, stairs, poles, doors, etc, and wait for the main subject to be in it. Night changes the behavior and the mood of the people and their surroundings. The professional street photographers use the night as an entirely different world to capture photos.The lights, the reflections, the darkness, and the environment are all mingled to convey a different kind of story that the place was telling during the day with the same surroundings. This is the most basic style of street photography that lights up the professional street photographer in you.This style literally allows you to roam around the places and click the photos of your surroundings just as they are. There is no particular subject to focus on, but every bit of matter that can be captured in the lens is clicked that shows the lifestyle of the people involved.The rush, the peace, the romance, the traffic,  the fun, and much that a surrounding has to offer are captured in lifestyle street photography.In this style, a subject is defined and is conscious of being shot by professional street photographers.You can ask your subject to pose in the desired manner and use the environment as its background.The style mixes the love for art and photography in one single frame. Here the shape, lighting, and colors matter a lot to capture something so wonderful that looks like a painted artwork.Street photography is a passion for those who love experimenting. There is a very low chance that you will fail with your experiments in street photography.Most photographers abide by the rules and follow the books, but I would suggest that you come out of your comfort zone, conquer the style, and don’t try to be a perfectionist all the time!Do not be scared of experimenting, changing the focus, or even missing the subject. Many times the professional street photographers end up with masterpieces just because their camera missed the focus!Using a prime lens with the correct focus can bring you the golden achievements that you’ve been longing for.You might consider clicking the photos at the highest aperture to get a more sharp and detailed shot. You may capture your subject the way you wanted, but if the environment of the background is smudged (not blurred) then the photo completely loses the story.Use the lens that blurs your surroundings only to the desired point so that the viewer can identify where you shot the image. Whether it was during the sunset near skyscrapers or in the morning near the beach. When you use the wide-angle lens, you get the advantage of shooting the subject from a very close distance but still managing to capture a whole lot of surrounding in the frame. Even though most professional photographers are used to keeping an extra battery and storage backup, still, I would recommend that you add an extra with what you usually keep in case of street photography.Unlike the other styles of photography where your subject and location are defined and you might have to take extra shots for ‘just in case’, that is not the case with professional street photography.If you are a professional street photographer, you might get a perfect shot around the corner at any point in time that you would not want to miss. Even if you have wrapped-up your day, you can never be sure if you would not encounter any great shot after that.The people, the light, or the situation can become ‘just perfect’ at any time. Therefore, just so you do not miss the opportunity, it is better to have an ‘extra’ extra battery with you. Though the idea of street photography is to capture the photos being unseen by the subject, it is better to ask for permission before you click the photos of children as their parents may get a bit concerned.Some people simply don’t like strangers taking photos of their children and might get aggressive. Being a professional street photographer, that is the first illegal line you should avoid crossing. Professional street photographers would do this when they want their subject to be in the bright light against the dark light of the surroundings.The effect creates a vintage, mesmerizing effect that has a mix of natural and artificial lighting. You would choose New York City for street photography for its high-rise buildings that absorb the light and reflect it back that provides natural soft light, or you may choose Switzerland for it’s dewy, cold, and bluish light that fits best for capturing snowy Christmas.It is better to choose the location based on what environment they possess to get the best stories to shoot. Most professional street photographers neglect the importance of post-production activities. Mainly due to the time, or they remain under the impression that the raw images work just fine.But let me tell you, what you see with your naked eyes on the street is captured very differently from your lens. When you get your photos edited by professionals, it enhances their quality, their look, and gets you the final product that could be above your imagination.Photo editing software is another level of experimenting with your street photography than what you originally have.  get your work done exactly in the desired manner that you and your photos demand to bring out the most of it.Be it the colors, subject, sharpness, or the details - editing can take your artwork to a next level. Street photography is the most flexible, fun, yet complicated and thoughtful style of photography.It can be tricky as there are no defined parameters to master but it rather demands the photographers’ ideology and perception to bring out something that is acceptable, likable, and inspiring.To master street photography, professional photographers should be ready to leave the boundaries and experiment without hurting any sentiments and feel of the story that the environment conveys.When you follow the tips that expand your working style makes it appropriate for your imagination and effort to create something astonishing.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/other/amazing-guide-to-conquer-professional-street-photography.html"},

{"heading": "Insects will be the cause of crop destruction in the tropics", "author": "Nicole Sturgill", "description": "Insects will be one of the main causes of crop loss in tropical countries of the world, especially with the rise of climate change and warming. A US study suggests so.", "word-count": 514, "body": "Insects will destroy at least 10-25% more wheat, rice and corn as global temperatures rise per degree, say researchers.The warming will make these  and increase their food intake. As well as their reproduction.And it will have an impact on the world's major food crops, according to Curtis Deutsch, co-author of the study.'Currently, the insect's diet is equivalent to 12 loaves of bread. However, if the overall temperature continues to rise at this rate by the end of this century, the food intake of these insects will be two more loaves.' Researchers at the University of Washington told B-BC.In the study, published in the journal Science, they performed a mathematical calculation using data collected from around the world. Which indicates that as the temperature rises, crop damage increases.The team of researchers analyzed the data of 36 species of harmful insects through their mathematical models. They wanted to see how temperature affects the growth of these pests as well as their effect on food grains. This test was run to understand future crop losses.The impact of climate change has shown that with each increase in temperature, the loss of falls is 5 percent.And if the effects of insects are added there, the amount of damage will go up to 50%, says Professor Tuxbury of Boulder Boulder University in the United States.Which areas will be more affected?According to Professor Tuxbury, the higher the temperature, the more insects will breed and the faster they will start eating crops.According to him, 'the impact will be more visible in Europe's 'bread basket' and the US 'corn zone'.' He added that 'in many European countries such effects can be seen up to 50-100%.'This means that the loss of wheat production in Europe will be at least 18 million.But temperatures in the tropics have already reached a record high for the growth of these insects. Now their growth rate has slowed down.How is it possible to get out of this situation?One of the world's most crop-producing regions is at risk, such as the United States, France and China.When corn, rice and wheat are damaged, it will actually be a disaster, as we get 42% of the body's required calories from these grains.Climate models say the average global temperature will rise by 2-5 degrees by 2100.In that case, temperatures could rise by at least 2 degrees Celsius by the middle of this century, and the expected crop damage by insects could begin to occur within that time, the researchers said.What could be the solution?To ensure food security, emphasis should be placed on crop adaptation. Such is the opinion of Professor Tuxbury.The use of pesticides in crop fields is very common in Europe, especially in Britain. However, experts warn that warmer climates can make insects more resistant to pesticides.So Professor Poppy emphasized the use of more biological methods in pest control. Harmful insects can be controlled using ladybirds.It can also be done by changing the time of sowing the crop or by cultivating pest-resistant crop varieties.According to the researchers, the combined use of all the methods can be much more effective in this regard.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/other/insects-will-be-the-cause-of-crop-destruction-in-the-tropics.html"},

It is a calming gemstone that also helps with communication and honesty.Dining Room: From there, we will move to the dining room where Blue Agate will help with a lively conversation and allow for a confident expression of ideas, without a hint of arguments and acrimony.For those watching what they eat, Apatite gemstones suppress hunger pangs so you can resist that second helping.Kitchen: The kitchen can be your favourite room or the last place on earth you want to be; we have a couple of gemstones that may help. Carnelian will get your creativity flowing and bring out the inner Gordon Ramsay.However, if cooking is more of a chore than a pleasure, try some Pyrope Garnet as it will boost your energy and motivation at the end of a long and tiring day.Bathroom: A bathroom is a place of relaxation and revitalization, and there is no better gemstone for both than Clear Quartz, a cleansing and purifying gemstone that will also bring clarification and positivity in your life.Bedroom: Either Amethyst or Rose Quartz (better still, let them work in combination) are perfect gemstones for the bedroom. Amethyst brings a restful night’s sleep, free of bad dreams and Rose Quartz inspires feelings of love and romance.Children’s Bedroom: For the children’s bedroom, we would suggest Moonstone keep away nightmares and the fear of the dark.Also, Peridot, the Study Stone, will help with homework and preparation for exams.Office: The office at home will benefit from the Tiger’s Eye gemstone or two. This gemstone will get you focused on the task at hand and will keep you motivated and concentrating all day long.However, if your home office contains lots of electronic equipment and wifi connections, then keep some Malachite nearby as it will block and absorb the harmful electromagnetic radiation.Garden: In the end, just as much part of the home is the garden, the plants and vegetable patches could do with some , too, and none is better than Green Aventurine, the gemstone of prosperity and abundance, that will blossom and bear fruit in your backyard in no time.The use of gemstones in individual rooms can be as simple as placing one or two on a cabinet, shelf or side table. You can create an imaginative aesthetic display or make an elixir to spray around the room to fill it with the gemstone’s aura.We have chosen the gemstones based on their sphere of influence and the most common function of each.

Then what is the difference between the terms commercial photography and advertising photography?PixelPhant blogs are all about answering all your questions, and today we are here to draw a clear line of difference between these two most widely used photography styles in advertising.In this blog, we are going to dissect these photography styles, along with the tips and equipment you would need to master them.If you are all set to learn all this, here’s the ultimate guide for you to clear all your doubts regarding commercial photography and advertising photography.Commercial photography is a niche of promotional photography, where your key focus is to showcase the product in its best possible look. It can include , food photography, , real estate photography, etc.You could find examples of such photography in the banners, or the stock promotional photos where the key focus is just to make the product look attractive and appealing to purchase it.Proper lighting and other equipment are used to bring out the epitome of the product. Moreover, the product in the frame is the center focus despite the other subjects that are captured alongside the product.Commercial photography may not need each of the equipment mentioned at every shoot, so no need to go broke. Instead, start with a DSLR and prime lens, go along the journey, and purchase what becomes the necessity.Advertising Photography is another popular promotional photography where the key focus is to represent the emotions or feelings that you would get out of the product. Mostly if the product is new and wishes to attract new customers by showing what to expect (in terms of emotion and satisfaction) then advertising photography is used.You could find examples of such photography in images where instead of producing a story can be found. This could be about looking classy, trendy, young, or could be about feeling happy, motivated, satisfied, or even complete.As a photographer, you have much more liberty to change the lighting, shooting from irregular angles, or experimenting with the way the product is usually seen. The goal here still stays to make people like the product, but for the emotional satisfaction, they can get from the product.Now that you have understood what commercial photography and advertising photography is, it’s time to show you the line of difference in the following spectrum. Commercial photography is more product-centric, whereas advertising photography is more customer-centric.A product may use both styles of promotional photography but it’s important that you are aware of the intent of both the photography style.While both commercial photography and advertising photography are focused to increase the sale of the product, the intent differs vividly.As we discussed, you can follow up with any of these two photography styles. Moreover, you can even switch between them whenever the project demands, but it’s important to remember what your end goal is.With this, we conclude the differences between Commercial photography and advertising photography.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/other/difference-between-commercial-photography-and-advertising-photography.html"},

The casings, sleeves, and bearings need to be checked periodically to avoid any short circuits due to leakage. reveal why leakage happens and how you can prevent such leakage for the pump's better life.

Companies manufacturing the pump seals spent a lot of workforces and lost operational time to fix the leakage. So, the Pump Seal manufacturer in India, design the seals so that it prevents the leakage. A seal shaft failure is one of the major causes of downtime. Sewage pumps are susceptible to such dangers of leakage as they operate around water, which leads to corrosion. A wide variety of seals are available for any applications that involve water or other fluids. The most commonly used seal is the end face mechanical seal for sewage pumps. The end face seals have two-faces, a ring-like flat against each other in the seal chamber located between the volute and the motor.

Best Psychiatrist in Gurgaon excels in giving proper treatment for mental illness. Proper recognition of any mental illness will help you to take proper medicines and care for the fast recovery from the illness. A medical manual published by the American Psychiatric Association, named Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) is a book in which about all the mental illness and their symptoms are clearly defined.

It may also cause due to any kind of infections that has occurs in the brain cells and it ay worsen the symptoms too. Early fatal brain development or trauma that had occurred at the time of birth may also lead to mental illness. 2- Psychological factorsSome of the psychological factors also affect the mental problem. Here are few examples of the factors like when a person as a child has suffered from certain incidents that has traumatised them like sexual abuse, sudden death of closed ones, emotional or physical breakdown. When a person is continuously neglected by others or he/she feels low in contacting with others these are the symptoms that a person might be suffering from mental problem. 3- Environmental FactorsEnvironmental factors can also ignite mental problem in certain persons. Some examples are social or cultural expectations, feelings of loneliness, continuous anger and anxiety. Change of schools or jobs frequently can also lead to mental problem.

Therefore, we will have to deal with this through the work of emotions and relearn through new experiences.Five keys to face the fear of flyingPsychological treatment: The best way to deal with your fear of flying is to start a treatment in which a professional psychologist will help you understand and gradually face this phobia. One of the things that are done during the psychological treatment of a phobia is the application of various techniques, such as exposure. Progressively exposing ourselves to the things that scare us helps us gradually approach the source of anxiety and fear with more resources and a feeling that we can face them.Avoidance resources: It is recommended not to ingest substances. The use of anxiolytics is only advised if it has been prescribed by a professional.Anticipation: A few weeks before a trip, the person with aerophobia can begin to feel anxious and anticipate all the things that can go wrong. This anticipatory fear can affect the performance of daily activities and cause insomnia, irritability, dismissals, etc. Share your worries and address them with relaxation techniques.The hyper-letter: When you expect something bad to happen, it is easy to interpret each signal as a premonitory of something terrible. All attention is paid to anxiety symptoms and negative thoughts. Instead, we can anticipate and create a safety net and distraction: look for good hobbies during the trip, wear comfortable clothes, fly accompanied, trust the crew, etc.A secondary problem: Sometimes the fear of flying is due to major problems such as agoraphobia (with or without panic attacks) or fear of heights. Therefore, therapy should focus on treating these problems. In any case, a professional can help you define exactly what is happening and recommend the appropriate therapy.Avoiding getting on the plane prolongs the fear of flying, so make an appointment as soon as possible to fully enjoy your vacation.The information published by does not replace in any case the relationship between the patient and his psychologist.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/psychology/5-key-tips-to-overcome-the-fear-of-flying.html"},

Why are my relatives so concerned about my hair?Because it should hurt. It does hurt. That puts most of us off pulling our hair. Hence it's not unacceptable because of a logical reason, it's not acceptable because it’s unusual. People like everyone to act similarly and process information similarly. They don't generally understand that different people deal with things differently.Do you think your pain receptors or sensory experience is different to other people? Are your family concerned about something like sensory processing disorder? It's quite common in those ‘with Autism’ or as many prefer, ‘those who are Autistic’. Would they be concerned around that? Neuro diversity would perhaps give them a better understanding.Why are depression and anxiety the most common mental illnesses?Depression and anxiety are both common mental illnesses because, unlike things such as borderline personality disorder or schizophrenia, there are strong environmental causes for depression and anxiety.Put less clumsily, the death of a loved one and stressful event at work are not going to cause something like schizophrenia or psychosis in most people (although high stress can cause a psychotic episode in people if they are not sleeping/are predisposed to it). But those two things happening at the same time can cause acute anxiety and severe depression. Anxiety and depression can easily come on due to situational triggers, whereas schizophrenia seems to have a strong genetic component. Of course, you can be genetically prone to anxiety, but it is easier to experience anxiety and depression because of things that happen in your life; things that eventually happen in all of our lives.What ended up happening?I broke myself down. I tore myself apart. I was my harshest inner-critic. I belittled myself for not doing this, and not being that.

{"heading": "The Complete Guide to Ad Inventory Arbitrage", "author": "Eyal Katz", "description": "", "word-count": 623, "body": "Between the advertiser and the audience there are multiple entities, each taking a percentage of the advertiser’s investment. This is called inventory arbitraging.Ad agencies, trading desks, networks, and all sorts of “middle-men” have existed since the first editor of a publication said: “I am tired of talking to advertisers”.Inventory arbitrage refers to a practice used by ad industry mediators, such as ad agencies, trading desks or networks, of buying ad space directly from publishers and selling it at a higher price to advertisers. The margin between inventory bought (from publishers) and sold (to advertisers) is how these companies generate revenue. More middle-men have squeezed their way into the arbitrage equation, and it’s no longer just agencies and trading desks. It’s , often by     At this point, you’re probably developing a thorough dislike of these middle-men. If they’re getting a piece of the cake, this means less cake for you, as a publisher. But the very existence of middlemen implies they have a role to play in the digital ad market.The most important role arbitrageurs have in the ad market is reach and exposure. It’s better to share the cake than have none at all. With the help of arbitrage agencies, advertisers can (for a fee, of course) reach more publications. And publishers can fill ad spaces that would otherwise go unmonetized.The consolidation of the ad market and the improvement in communication between exchanges, DSPs and SSPs, forced arbitrageurs to evolve. To continue charging advertisers a premium for each view or click, they had to create added value for their clients. This evolution brought in another variable into the arbitrage equation – data.Agencies began to collect user data and develop optimization algorithms. For example, using machine learning and user profiling, agencies could purchase inventory at CPM, but offer the advertiser performance-based pricing (CPA). They call it “strategic media buying”, and advertisers often prefer these types of deals as they get a much better picture of their digital advertising ROI.  Despite the above mentioned contribution arbitrageurs have to the ad market, they are often seen as vultures, preying on advertising budgets while contributing little to the ecosystem. Trading in inventory without adding value is often seen as plain exploitation of the system.For example, an inventory trader can purchase banner placement on a publication (or several) at CPM. He can then sell this placement to video demand channels at a much higher cost in CPV. In-banner video is just one of the techniques arbitrage traders use.Another major issue with ad inventory arbitrage is that views get repackaged, re-purposed and resold once or more before the advertiser creative pops up in an ad spot. The more times the traffic “cycles” through the system, the harder it is to tell its source.There’s no lack of black-hat traffic generation techniques, many of them using clickbots, botnets and other naughty things to get you banned on AdSense and other networks. When mixed in with legitimate ad views, this traffic poisons the pool, creating low performance for advertisers and a loss of trust in the automated ad trading market.  So it’s no surprise exchanges, DSPs and ad networks like . But as long as there’s a need for them, the middle-men will still be there, exploiting the margins.But what does all this mean for you, the publisher? That you too need to evolve.Offering your inventory to a select DSP or even sticking to direct sales only will eliminate the middlemen and their profit. But it will also limit the demand sources for your inventory, preventing you from getting the highest possible bid for every placement.On the other hand, offering your unsold inventory on the open RTB market can be a scary endeavor, opening your inventory to reselling and loss of value.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/publishing/the-complete-guide-to-ad-inventory-arbitrage.html"},

{"heading": "Tacoma-A premium adventure platform for the family", "author": "dieseltruckreview", "description": "Austin Haidinyak is an industrial designer in the outdoor and travel industries. Along with his wife, a 3-year old son, and a Shiba Inu named Maggie, he loves to get outdoors and travel as often as possible. Off-road and overland travel by vehicle not only allows Haidinyak to get out and test his work creations firsthand but also spend time with the family in the remote natural places that he loves.", "word-count": 1540, "body": "Why a Tacoma?Haidinyak’s last vehicle was a ’10  Rubicon. The two-door JK was built with long-arm long-travel suspension for crawling technical trails. Rock gardens were Haidinyak’s playground. Fast-forward to his son being born and a more family-oriented overland adventure vehicle was needed.With ambitious plans over the next few years, which include long stretches of backcountry throughout the Americas for up to six months at a time, a  TRD Off-Road was the vehicle that fit his family’s needs. A Tacoma is reliable, comfortable, and capable, which makes it a quality family adventure machine option.After shopping around for a third-generation Tacoma, Haidinyak decided to go with a second-gen instead. The proven reliability of the second-gen Tacoma along with the purchase price savings are what tipped the scale. Haidinyak figures that the money difference was much better used on upgrades than buying the newer truck.2010 Toyota Tacoma TRD Off-Road Dual-Cab ShortbedThe specific truck Haidinyak found for his latest build is this Magnetic Metallic Gray ’10 Tacoma TRD Off-Road dual-cab short bed. When he bought it in 2018 it came completely stock, except for the addition of a color-matched Snugtop truck canopy on the bed. The truck had around 110,000 miles on the clock, which was about as low as Haidinyak could find. This truck also came with the 4.0L naturally aspirated V-6 engine, automatic transmission, factory rear locker, and a factory roof rack.Capable &amp; ComfortableYou might ask what’s unique about yet another Tacoma overland camper build. What separates this build from the crowd is the combination of quality high-end parts that give it both extreme off-road capability and extreme self-supported camp comfort. This Tacoma is a very capable trail rig and also offers a very comfortable remote camping experience—a unique combo.Haidinyak isn’t a mechanic. He can wrench enough to deal with field repairs and some maintenance but prefers to leave the build to the experts. For this build, he turned to the overland vehicle experts at Mule Expedition Outfitters in Issaquah, Washington. Not only did the shop build the truck, but they also helped consult on and source the top-quality parts that make this machine the impressively functional unit that it is.Wheel TravelThe start of most good builds begins with suspension, wheels, and tires. An OME BP- 51 2-inch lift system, featuring remote-reservoir internal-bypass shocks, were fitted for the ultimate in off- and on-road comfort. Total Chaos upper control arms were fitted for ease of alignment and additional wheel travel. Outback, Hilux leaf spring packs, and Firestone airbags with Daystar cradles handle the added weight of this build.With some added clearance from the lift, some fender trimming, Bushwhacker Fender Flares, and a body mount chop, it was time for some big tires. Haidinyak managed to wedge 34.5-inch BFGoodrich KM3s under this Tacoma. In the wintertime, he runs 33.1- inch BFGoodrich KO2s, which offer him enough room to run chains when needed. Bronze 16-inch SCS F5 wheels, with 3.5 inches of backspacing, allow for taller sidewall tires and a wider stance. They are also a lightweight, easy-to-clean wheel option that looks amazing, all of which Haidinyak appreciates as a designer himself.Moving up in tire size required re-gearing. Haidinyak opted for quality 4.88 gears from Nitro Gear. While the diff was open, an ARB front air locker was also installed. The rear has a factory e-locker already, so no need for an upgrade there. Haidinyak likes to push his rigs off-road and found selectable lockers an invaluable tool on his Jeep and has found them even more invaluable with the Tacoma’s limited, in comparison, articulation.Off-Road ReadyNow that the truck was rolling right, it was time to make the rest of the truck ready for the off-road adventures ahead. Upfront there is an aluminum CBI Moab 2.0 bumper, which provides more clearance and aggressive looks. The optional full grille and light protection hoop protect against animal strikes; Elk is a concern in Eastern Oregon where Haidinyak is based. A Warn Zeon 10-S winch with Factor 55 FlatLink and a full complement of ARB, Baja Designs, and Rigid LED lights are also fitted to the front bumper.Haidinyak says that a Safari Snorkel is mandatory equipment for him. The first reason being to feed cleaner, cooler air to the engine on long days driving across the desert. The second reason is that he can’t help driving through deep water every chance he gets. He says, “It makes me happy.” For those deepwater plunges, ARB differential breather kits were also installed.Besides the snorkel and bumper, the front end of the truck looks quite a bit different because of the ditch lights and front grille. The ditch lights are Rigid Industries Dually D2 floodlights attached using CBI brackets. The replacement front grille is a metal mesh and plastic unit from @HowerTaco. Haidinyak just couldn’t handle the aesthetics of the plastic and chrome OEM grille and likes the additional visibility that the added amber LEDs in the new grille provide.More armor was also needed, as this truck is driven hard in rough terrain. White Knuckle Off-Road sliders are drawn over- mandrel (DOM) bent, upswept for clearance, and feature diamond plating on the rear kick-out. The slider steps not only protect the cab from damage but help Haidinyak access the roof rack and help his young son climb in and out of the truck. A full set of CBI aluminum Overland Skids protect the underside of the truck, along with Total Chaos steel LCA skids. A CBI high-clearance rear bumper rounds out the armor package.On the roof is an Alu-Cab WoodBox 2.0 on Alu-Cab Load Bars. It swallows extra gear and is a great place to carry messy items like firewood. The roof system also holds two Wavian jerricans in Alu-Cab holders, two pairs of Maxtrax traction boards, a Baja Designs LED light bar and a few area lights.The stuff you don’t see is just as important as the stuff you do. Underhood an ARB twin compressor is installed with a bracket from Slee Offroad. A fully electrical system, designed by Mule Expedition Outfitters, features dual Odyssey Extreme Series 35 batteries, Off-Grid Engineering components, and some additional parts from Blue Sea. The headlight bulbs were replaced with IPF LED units, which greatly improved driving lighting on- and off-road. Additional recovery items include an ARB winch recovery kit, ARB air tools, and a tire repair kit.Camper BuildOne of the last upgrades to go on this truck, and the crown jewel of this build, is the Alu-Cab Khaya Prime Camper. The Khaya Camper is a full-featured aluminum slide-in pop-top truck-bed camper. With tons of storage, a comfy bed, and an outdoor kitchen, this camper leaves you wanting for nothing.Creature comforts of the Khaya Camper include a National Luna fridge/freezer, diesel air heater, water heater, shower system, two-burner propane stove, and even a kitchen sink. On the roof is a massive 252- watt solar system and a pair of Yakima roof bars to haul bulky outdoor toys. An Alu-Cab Shadow Awn 270 awning and a slide-out table-mounted under the cab-over round out the camper feature on this quality home away from home.Passenger ComfortsInside the truck, a Pioneer Navigation head unit with Apple CarPlay has greatly improved the road trip experience. Along with upgraded speakers and an amp, the audio system keeps the party going down the road. Haidinyak prefers to use his iPhone with the Gaia GPS app for navigation, with the in-car nav and a Bad Elf GPS as backups.There are lots of electrical accessories on this truck, all controlled on a Switch-Pros panel, mounted with a bracket from Expedition Essentials in the overhead sunglasses compartment. Not only is this a super clean install, but keeps Haidinyak’s young kid away from the light-up switches that he’d surely love to play with.For communication on the trail, GMRS handheld radios are used. For longer range comms, a Cobra 75WX CB radio was installed, with a FireStick antenna mounted to the front bumper. A ham radio system is also in this truck’s future.Finishing out the interior is a critical upgrade for life on the road with a dog and a toddler. Wet Okole neoprene seat covers were installed throughout. They were optioned with air-adjustable lumbar support and a full host of accessory pockets. These custom-fit washable seat covers keep the interior working and looking as good as possible.Less is MoreWhen this Tacoma is full of people, fuel, water, and basic camping gear, it is at about its gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR)—that is without the camper. Weight is always going to be an issue with a built Tacoma because of its relatively low payload capacity, so Haidinyak is continually working on ways to lighten the load. Lately, he’s even considered ditching the camper and switching to an off-road trailer system. It’s just too much fun to bomb around off-road in this fully built Tacoma without all the added camper weight.Built for AdventureThis truck build has already been on big adventures throughout Utah, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, and California. Having recently completed the Mojave Road, the next big trips on the agenda are all the western state's Backcountry Discovery Routes (BDRs) over the next few years. Further afield adventures in some Central American countries are also on Haidinyak’s to-do list with this adventure machine.For more on this truck, Subscribe", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/publishing/tacoma-a-premium-adventure-platform-for-the-family.html"},

Typically, products and services with a higher price tag tend to have lower conversion rates than lower priced ones.So consider this hypothetical example:Business A is selling a $20 product with a 40% conversion for every 100 people they offer. Business B is selling a $2,000 product with a 2% conversion for every 100 they offer.Business A ends up making $800. Business B makes $4,000 in sales.

The fabric on the other hand is made up of interlacing fibers through weaving, knitting or any such process that is used for making further products. A cloth is referred to as something that is the result of the processing of original fabric. As the title indicates, I will dwell on how these fancy  came to be and how they end up in such magnificent touches and colors from a handful of simple raw materials or source materials. When we see online fabrics showing such color schemes that are captivating and equally charming, we have never an idea that these diverse groups of beautiful cloths are produced from a small number of basic fabric types and these basic fabrics are derived from an even smaller number of basic source materials that again are weaved in three or four basic weaving styles. Beginning from such humble sources, these fabrics are then processed further and there is much work done before giving it a final touch. After all, it is an industry that involves people who grow mulberry trees to rear silk-worm and people who rear sheep or goats to obtain wool from them to large factories where complex machines refine the source materials and further process it. Hand mills are also common in developing countries. All these factors are part of a long chain i.e. called textile industry. Here is a list of the three most common origins of . Animals:Fabric derived from animals includes silk and wool mainly. Some fabric is also derived from hair and skin. Chinese silkworm is the chief resource of silk that is secreted from threads of the cocoons and is known for its softness. There is also a wild silk that is known as Tussah silk. Wool is obtained from sheeps. India and some African countries are the largest producers of wool.  Plants:Grass, hemp, and sisal are used in making fibers besides cotton and flax which are chief resources of making fabric worldwide. Sometimes even bark of plants is used for making fibers that yield a fascinating fabric.  Synthetic fibers:Polyester fiber is one of the most popular fibers nowadays that can be used in every type of clothing sometimes alone and sometimes blended with other natural fibers such as cotton. Aramid is used for preparing clothes that are fire-resistant and thus finds its use in fire-resistant equipment.Acrylic is a type of synthetic fiber that can be used in place of silk as it resembles it greatly in its physical appearance and properties. These are some of the commonest origins of all  that display a mind-boggling complexity and diversity. All these fibers whether animal or plant-based or synthetic are treated before weaving into different patterns and sometimes they are blended with other types of fibers so there are more than one type of fibers in the end-user product. After the fabric has been obtained, most of the time it is treated with chemicals or pressure and steam combined for the purpose of pleating. The printing process is also a must nowadays. This is a standard procedure that adds colorful painting or drawing to the final product. We can say it is a whole industry.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/sales/the-origins-of-online-fabrics.html"},

Because of the comfort, the kids feel wearing them and designs,", "word-count": 523, "body": "have become quite popular these days and really look cute on kids. Because of the comfort, the kids feel wearing them and designs, they have become favourite of parents as well. These are also available in several patterns and colours, and one can choose the pair which matches their kids choice. But, one thing to keep in mind is that one should not get lured by the colours and patterns available but keep a few factors in mind while buying a pair for your kid(s).The first thing to keep in mind is the size of the kid's feet for whom you are buying the pair of Havaianas. Usually, different sizes come in different patterns. When these  fit perfectly in the feet of the wearer, then only they give a perfect look. So, knowing the feet size of your kid before buying that desirable pair becomes imperative. It will not only give an attractive look to your kid's appearance but will also provide the desired comfort. You can also take the kid with you while purchasing as it will help you to choose the perfect pair for your child. The second thing which you need to check is the quality of the Havaianas you are planning to buy. A good quality pair of Havaianas will last longer and save your money. As kids are super active as compared to the adults, it becomes crucial to pay attention to the quality of the footwear you buy for them so that they last for a considerable period of time. As kids are pretty reckless, it is essential to pay attention to the safety of the kid's feet and therefore pick a pair of Havaianas which are gentle on their feet. The best quality ensures that there are no unwanted expenditures which you have to face while replacing them. Now, the next factor to keep in mind is the colour of the  you will be choosing for your kid. The colour of the Havaianas determines their appearance and how well they will complement your kids dressing. So, it is advised to select a colour and design that is appealing to the eyes and also complements your kids dressing. Choosing a colour that complements most of your kid's dressing will ensure that you don't have to buy a new pair to complement new clothes. Usually, dull colours are dominant and are the best option to match with most of the clothes. So, select a pair of Havaianas which complements maximum clothes of your kids and is even of the choice of your child. The last and most crucial factor to consider is the comfort of your kid. Not all the kids are comfortable wearing flip-flops. So, it would be best if you buy a customized pair for your kids. For toddlers, selecting a pair of flip-flops with fasteners on the back to ensure that the flip-flop doesn't slip off is one of the best options. Please pay attention to the quality of the material of the flip-flops so that it does not cause irritation to the child's feet.Hope these tips will help you select the  for you kid.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/sales/getting-the-kids-havaianas.html"},

{"heading": "Beautifully Beaded Mermaid Bridal Dress Called Gemeni", "author": "Winnie Couture", "description": "Beautifully Beaded Mermaid Bridal Dress Called Gemeni", "word-count": 467, "body": "Beautifully Beaded Mermaid Bridal Dress Called GemeniIt is hard to choose just one gown, as each day I find a new reason to like them more and more. I find that to be the most rewarding part about this career. Each bride is so different from the next and they look at each dress with different eyes. I am constantly learning new things to love about . You can overlook a gown a dozen times but when the right bride chooses to try it on, you can see it differently. I think a gown that has constantly impressed me and brides is Gemeni. It is rare for a bride not to look great while wearing Gemeni. They just light up the moment they see themselves in her. I love seeing that reaction and confidence exude from the bride.   Gemeni on the Hanger: Gemeni is a beautifully beaded mermaid gown with a fun dramatic textured skirt. The beading is composed of Swarovski crystals. We all love the look of an off the shoulder gown but hate the restriction that it causes. Winnie has found the perfect compromise and made detachable Swarovski beaded cuffs. This gives you the option to have the look of an off the shoulder and then remove it when you want more freedom to raise the roof. ‰  Gemeni on the Bride: Gemeni is perfect at showcasing a bride's curves or giving a less curvy bride the illusion of an hourglass figure. This is all strategically done by the way the beading is designed. How it curves around the hip and bust line. Even if the bride is petite the beading gives the illusion of length by being heavier on top and then vertically thinning out. The sweetheart neckline is very flattering and showcases the clavicles. For a more romantic feel, the detachable Swarovski beading cuff is a perfect addition. And of course the train! It is so dramatic and the way the tulle is textured makes it look like you're on a cloud.It is so effortlessly breath-taking as you walk down the aisle. You may think this is a high maintenance train but on the contrary it is very easy. The weight and the texture of the train help keep it extended and looking glamorous.   Gemeni as the Favorite:This beautiful wedding dress is a showstopper! (No matter what lighting you are in you will sparkle. Gemeni brings out a bride's confidence and reinforces that this is her big day. When wearing this  she feels sexy, sophisticated and stunning. Not to mention comfortable. With the internal boning she knows she can eat at her wedding and still maintain the tiniest waist. Also, with the built-in bra band, she knows her strapless gown is not going to falter and she can dance the night away. ƒ", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/sales/beautifully-beaded-mermaid-bridal-dress-called-gemeni.html"},

For one century, the cash register was a simple and powerful solution that provided enough functionality to keep organizations afloat. Over the years, cash registers evolved into complete Point Of Sale systems with complete back office features including accounting, inventory, procurement, vendor management and even logistics. This made a lot of sense before the digital age, where retail operators relied solely on their brick and mortar stores to generate revenue.With the surge in the last two decades of online and mobile commerce, some have speculated that brick-and-mortar retail was going the way of the dodo. Spectacular collapses of flagship global retailers fueled speculation that online interactions would soon mostly replace the in-store shopping experiences. But rumours of the extinction of retail have been, to paraphrase Mark Twain, greatly exaggerated. On the contrary: from 7-11s to Zara to Apple Stores, retailers are applying smart software to create a unified branded customer experience by integrating all marketing and sales channels. They are leveraging mobile, social media and web presence to drive shoppers into stores. They are encouraging in-store shoppers to stay in touch and shop via online channels.What we want to do here is to approach the issue of integrating retail systems both in their physical and online incarnations, considering best practices for creating a seamless and highly efficient solution for creating a lean, mean multi-channel operation, bridging the front and back ends of retail, from a mom-and-pop shop to a multi-national, multi-currency, multi-site chain. We will look at what works and what doesn’t, trying to identify practical steps for building in a scalable and future-proof manner.Point of Sale systems are, true to their name, taking a point position in this neo-brick paradigm, leading the way as the primary means for bridging between physical and online presence and dataflow, becoming increasing relevant to both the consumer’s experience and the business’ interactions with the consumer. A key takeaway is to recognise that any channel can be a point of sale, and to leave no buying opportunity unexploited. However, the growing relevance of POS comes with its own risks, as reflected in what we might described as an overreach by some vendors to retrofit back-end functionality to what is, at least by definition, a front-end, customer-facing set of functions.On the eCommerce side, Magento, Big Commerce, Shopify and other eCommerce platforms have enabled retailers of all sizes to quickly sell their products online. However, these engines typically work in isolation of all other consumer channels, operating on their own product and consumer databases. Why would a retailer want a source of data other than their ERP – unless of course they had no ERP and didn’t want to pay the price? And speaking of paying the price: often POS systems will take a hefty cut in transaction fees, cutting deep into the retailer’s margins. And the need to create a custom integration each time a POS needs to connect with an ERP or other external system, the costs mount, and not just on a one-time basis! Working with commission-taking third-parties is a kind of death by a hundred cuts! Many providers loosely call their POS systems “omnichannel”. But what is really an omnichannel POS ? Clearly, one that is natively and by design integrated with all other consumer channels, back office operations, and is also designed to integrate with any internal or external service. In ZOKU’s architecture, ZOKU’s intelligent client runs on the POS device, ZOKU Sync, a cloud based integration layer integrates the POS client in real time with EPR and CRM systems, consumer channels and essentially any service such as Marketplaces, 3PLs, Delivery Services and Payment Processors.Instead of “one size to fit all”, a more cost-effective solution to supporting the retail ecosphere should be “right-sized to fit all”. At least one multi-channel integration solution is taking this approach. Zoku is a new provider that has built its lightweight, relatively low-cost, cloud solution on a “lean, mean, flexible” architecture. Hardware agnostic and connecting disparate systems via modular API connectors, the Zoku approach is to adapt its solution to where each retail operation is right now.Instead of forcing retail customers to replace all its system with something monolithic and monstrous, Zoku gets out of the way of the core software components. It focuses on streamlining workflow, letting data stream seamlessly from one system to the next, bridging between front and back ends. What that means in practice is that changes at one point in the overall ecommerce system can ripple through automatically to every other point, automatically synching data and unifying flows. Ultimately, the advantages of Zoku’s agile, value-based approach to omni-channel retail integration tends to translate into much faster ROI. There is both a lower upfront cost and faster realisation of operational-savings, especially relative to solutions requiring expensive, time-consuming, and risky upgrades or replacements of back-end legacy systems. The Zoku multi-channel Commerce suite API has real-time integration connectors with ERPs like NetSuite as well as the most widely used eCommerce engines. It also has the smarts to cache ERP data to ensure your ecommerce site is not hostage to your backend. Especially with legacy systems, there is downtime – scheduled and unscheduled - that can’t be allowed to interfere with a seamless and continuous customer experience 24/7. Zoku enables you to have customised and flexible designs for your UI, both online and at the POS. You want a consistent look and feel across all consumer channels, with fully connected workflow: POS, web stores (such as your Amazon shop) mobile apps, ecommerce; social media pages and more. The API layer intelligently manages the integration of data flow system-wide.This approach handles the complexity of disparate commerce systems, keeps pace with change, and delivers that elevated and branded customer experience in harmonious, seamless, and powerful ways. The system also lets you leverage AI and automation to take full advantage of business intelligence in a practical way without breaking your budget or becoming dependent on any one hardware or software supplier. The key is to stay lean and agile - simple, modern and powerful - while hooking all your systems together and future-proofing your business.This lightweight and relatively lower-price option focuses on helping retailers up their commerce game across front and back-end system, in both online and in-store channels: 1. Reach customers across multiple channels seamlessly, owning channels and data2. Optimise operational excellence by leveraging a fully integrated infrastructure3. Future-proof and innovate by integrating internal and external data sources via API4. Harnessing analytics, visualisation, and BI recommendations to improve servicesThe Zoku Omnichannel  has enabled several Retail, Distribution and Food &amp; Beverage operators transform their business and is the only Point Of Sale System that has been approved by Oracle NetSuite as a Built For NetSuite (BFN) certified application.

Situated on Chennai's outskirts on the ECR road(Old Mahabalipuram Road), the temple covers an area of seven acres. Sai Baba was a great saint of the 18th century; his teaching, preaching, and miracles done for human goodness made everyone his devotee. People still worship him as God in different places dedicated to Sai Baba. The temple Saipuram faces the Bay of Bengal. The view of the seashore with lush greenery all around make it a must-visit place. In the complex, there are various other temples and structures other than the prime building dedicated to Sai Baba. Those who want to celebrate any major day of Sai Baba or cherish the peace of the coast are welcome here. The shrine of Sai Baba in the main temple is made of pure white marble. The handcrafted shrine is in a sitting position, and the temple is also built using white marble with a height of 100 ft. Sai Baba, in his days, used to burn the holy fire, also known as Dhuni. He believed that the Dhuni has the power to heal all the ailments of people. The same Dhuni burns in the temple uninterruptedly, and the ash is distributed among the devotees as the blessings of Sai Baba. There are other sub-temples where various Gods and Goddesses are placed. These are Shiva and Parvati, Durga, Hanuman, Ram, Sita and Lakshman, Venkateswara, Navagrahas, Krishna and Radha, and Muruga companions Valli and Devyani. There is a tree in the temple, and as per the belief, anyone who ties a turmeric dipped string with his wish gets granted by the same. People on Thursdays and Fridays visit the temple; they take the string and tie it to the tree. To facilitate the devotion, there is a Meditation Hall where people meditate and gain mental peace for some time. There is a free Health Care Center, too, where disciples get help with their ailments. There are shops for Puja items from where they can buy Puja items and books like Sai paraphernalia. To satisfy the hunger, there is a canteen as well. People can also make phone calls, and transportation facilities make it easy for people to transport to this place. At every Sai event, various ceremonies happen. Devotees say, Artis, become a part of the special Pujas. They also arrange food for the poor and earn good karma. One can visit the temple from 7 A.M to 1.30 P.M and 4 P.M to 8 P.M. Inside the temple As you enter the temple complex, the vibe of serenity and peace engulfs your mind. People feel the divine presence of Sai Baba, and they become one with the place. They engage in admiring the beautiful shrine of Sai Baba that they feel fulfilled with a compassionate soul. Other than the prime shrine, there is a small Sai baba temple which has a Bronze construction. The Ganesha idol, known as Vallabha Ganapathy and adorned with ten arms, is one of the temple's main attractions. There are other shrines of Lords like Shiva, Dattatreya, Vishnu, Hanuman, Ram with Sita and Lakshman. The prime Sai temple is made having a hexagonal structure. There are concrete ladders that lead to the top as the temple reaches a height of 100 feet. There are many other buildings to visit within the complex; the greenery all around produces cool air, and the seashore view makes it a magnificent visit for everyone. This shrine of Sai Baba is known as Dwarakamayee, and it is similar to the one established in Shirdi. Other than the Kalpatharu tree, a wish-fulfilling tree, people also take circles of the Danvanthari tree. It is believed that those who have any ailments if they take nine rounds of this tree, they gradually become free of their diseases. Those who want to stay for a day or two can make use of the guest house.

I am not talking about any particular religion rather about a belief in a super-natural being - the all powerful God. The answer to the question was to curb revolution or uprising. You may find this answer weird, but this is the truth.                Religion plays an important role to maintain the staus quo: Keeping the rich to their well-established status and restricting the poor from upward social mobility. This fact can be corroborated by going through the caste system of world's oldest religion, that is, Hinduism. The latter divides people according to their professions. In it, rich will getting richer while the poor will die of hunger..                 But another question arises here. What caused other religions to leave this abominable caste system. This is what we call a progressive human mind. Exploiters saw that this system of blood-sucking is causing annoyance, and people are considering it derogatory and inhumane. So, they invented change. But this time the change wasn't linear. People who were exploiting were from different societies, and they invented various religions according to their own rules. And because of this a plethora of new religions were given birth by the elites.                Meanwhile, the purpose of this creation of religion was that the poor were asked to find solace in God. They don't want to tell them the reality: that we are explioting you. Rather, the whole burden of their poverty falls on the 'fate'. The word fate is very intriguing and ambiguous. It deserves another article.              Coming back to our point, undoubtedly, religion is the mother of all ills because of its culture of promoting charity which, in turns, suffocates revolution. It wouldn't be wrong to say that the charity and revolution are inversly proportional. If one rises, the other have to bite the dust.                 In addition to this, it is often said that the capitalists exploit the masses. True. But what tool they use to exploit them? The tool is religion. They use it to justify their exploitation. And the main explanation they give is that 'it was in your destiny'. They often say that it is the God who has made you poor;  it is your destiny which is to blame; the god is angry at you; and you should atone for your sins. We have nothing to do with it.  These are many other explanations they give to poor in order to appease them.                        The conclusion which we can draw from this article is that if we want to eradicate expliotation of the poor, we should shun religion.

Even a few centuries ago, astronomy and astrology were considered to be the same things. But with the advancement of science, each and every practice had to give scientific evidence to prove its usefulness. Astronomy passed this test with flying colors and was taken up as a science but unfortunately astrology was unable to give adequate scientific evidence and was given the status of a pseudoscience and due to this reason the twin sisters parted ways forever. How is astrology different from astronomy?There is a marked difference between astronomy and astrology. Astronomy is the scientific study of the celestial objects such as stars, galaxies, planets, etc. whereas astrology uses the positions of the planet and relates it to the events of a person’s life.Astronomy tells about the universe and various aspects of the solar system and the celestial bodies. On the other hand, astrology utilizes the information related to planets and stars and attempts to draw a connection between the celestial bodies and human affairs.  As per the , astrology is based on astronomy but is not equivalent to it. The main reason behind this difference is that astronomical calculations are the same for everyone and therefore, can be taken as a standard value but the effects of a particular planet might be different for different individuals.  Why do people still believe in astrology?Although many people consider astrology to be a leisurely passtime, there are many who still believe in this genuine practice and base the important decisions of their lives on the basis of astrology. So how is it that even after lack of scientific evidence, astrology still remains to be a trustworthy practice that plays a major role in people’s daily lives? The reason is that astrology may not be a science but the predictions made by the astrologer have worked for the betterment of people since many centuries and continues to do so. The concept of astrology is very simple. According to the , every individual is unique and therefore, their horoscope charts are unique as well. No two horoscope charts are the same because every person has their own destiny based on their karmic actions. As the karma of a person changes, so does their fate and therefore, only they hold the power to change their destiny. This is what astrology teaches them and guides them to the right direction that leads them to fame and fortune. While astronomers tell about the external nature of celestial bodies, astrologers deal with those aspects of planets where their positions can hamper the functioning of the lives of the people on earth. And it is an established fact that many people have got solutions to their problems through the medium of astrology. So, even this twin sister has not retained its outer beauty (scientific evidence), it still holds its inner beauty (guiding people and solving their problems).", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/religion/why-are-astrology-and-astronomy-called-twin-sisters.html"},
{"heading": "How to Incorporate the Teachings of the Quran in Your Life?", "author": "Anoshia", "description": "The glorious Quran is full of wisdom and contains teachings for a happy, fulfilling, and successful life both in this world and the hereafter. The question is: how to incorporate these teachings in our lives? This article attempts to provide a few tips.", "word-count": 629, "body": "One of the best ways to bring real meaning to your life is by incorporating the teachings of the Quran in your daily routine. Quran has everything that enlightens the mind and soul and softens our hearts. Practicing its teachings in our day to day life is the most effective way to bring a positive change in your attitude and behavior.Here are some top ways you can do that now!To implement what the Quran says, you first need to understand what Allah (S.W.T) is conveying in His book. In addition to learning the Quran with the correct Tajweed (recitation rules), you must also read it with an easy translation that helps you understand that message.Reciting the Quran has its own blessings. It instantly connects you with your Creator and alleviates all sorts of negativities, grief, and sorrow in your heart. Start with a few pages every day and jot down the message you receive from it on a daily basis.  A great way to do this without even getting out of your home is to . This is especially useful for those who find it difficult to physically go to Islamic learning centers due to their tight schedules or long commutes.The Quran is full of kind and beautiful gestures that not only make you a good Muslim but an amazing human being. Learn from that message and start incorporating them into your daily life. Here are a few examples:There are several verses in the Quran that advised people to treat their parents with kindness and respect. In chapter 31, verse 14, Allah says in the Quran:'And we have enjoined man in respect of his parents -- his mother bears him with faintings upon faintings and his weaning takes two years -- saying: Be grateful to Me and to both your parents; to Me is the eventual coming.'Respect your parents and be good to them, especially when they start aging for they have been through a lot to bring you where you are today. Listen to them, be patient with them, and show utter respect. It's one of the best ways to please your Lord. Quran has generously mentioned the rights of neighbors. To become a good Muslim and human being, it is important that you treat your neighbors with respect.Usually, we are so busy with our friends, social life, and work pressure that we forget people who are living next door.To be good to our neighbors is not only a great teaching from the Quran but also a great example lived by our Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W). Keep yourself updated with their situations and offer help whenever needed. Invite them over to your house and share your food.  'The believer's shade on the Day of Resurrection will be his charity' - Hadith of the Prophet.One cannot ignore how many times the word 'charity' has been mentioned in the Holy Quran. Feeding the needy and the poor, travelers and relatives, supporting orphans, and spending your wealth in the way of Allah are some great references you can find in the Holy Book that you can easily implement in your daily life.Gone are the days when mealtime was family time. The dinner table used to serve more than just a place for everyone to eat. It was used for family discussions where religious teachings, principles, and values are passed onto the younger family members.Mealtime is a great way to spend quality time with family and communicate ideas. Use this place to establish an Islamic culture in your home. In addition to sharing the values, use the dinner table for 'Dhikr'. For a Muslim, it's never late to turn to Allah or his Holy Book. These are some great ways to help you reconnect to its beautiful teaching and resonate with spiritual fulfillment.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/religion/how-to-incorporate-the-teachings-of-the-quran-in-your-life.html"},

The Cancer Lagna, as falls under the aspect of the ninth lord Jupiter and fifth and tenth lord Mars, forms a Raj Yoga in the chart. In 1982, there was the Dasha Chiddra going on when Sachin was nine years old. The Moon-Moon period in Vimshottari, along with Saturn that went through the 3rd house, made him enter the cricket school of Mumbai. This was the first step of Sachin toward the world of cricket, where he got his training from late Shri Ramakant Achrekar of Mumbai. He first got the eyes of media when he was 16 years old in 1989. This was the time of Sade-Sathi’ for him, and Saturn transited over his natal Moon in Sagittarius, making him under the limelight. The Moon-Ketu Dasha period in Vimshottari also led him to make a debut on 15-November-1989 against Pakistan. The moon residing in Lagna with tenth lord Venus and conjunction of the 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 11th houses/lords in the Dashamsha chart make him savor as a great sportsperson. Sachin continued to dominate the cricket world for all these years until he was once accused of ball tempering. In that period he was going through the Rahu-Rahu phase in Vimshottari, which happened in 2001. After a year from 2002 to 2003, the Rahu-Jupiter period made Sachin go into controversy again. Rahu in the 6th house here troubled him due to import duty related to the Ferrari car, which was gifted to Sachin by the F1 Champion Michael Schumacher. From July 2004 to June 2007, the Rahu-Saturn period in Vimshottari was going on. This made both Rahu and Saturn go in a 6/8 position from each other. The influence of this period became the reason that Sachin suffered from a back injury that there were rumors about him for going off the field. However, both Rahu and Saturn at this stage were in good yogas that helped him with an amazing comeback. In 2010, his chart presented with the Vimshottari Dasha of Rahu-Ketu. As a result, Sachin was offered with the Indian Air Force’s honorary rank of Group Captain. The Rahu was placed in Sagittarius, which gave him the honor for his achievements and contributions to the nation in the field of cricket. The period from January 2011 to January 2014 was the Dasha of Rahu-Venus in Vimshottari. This Dasha is known for bringing great transformations, and the same happened when Sachin won the world cup in April 2011. At that time, Venus was well-placed in the Lagna as well as the Rashi chart that made Sachin go after the achievements. In the same year, 2011, the master blaster took a loan and gifted himself with a 450 sq ft 1BHK in Panvel, Mumbai. When the lord of 4th &amp; 10th together reside with Saturn and Mars, the person acquires mansions. Here the Chathurthamsha Venus giving aspect to the lagan with the twelfth lord Jupiter showcases that the change in residence was destined. After Sachin achieving so much and getting famous, people thought that Sachin would take retirement from the field. However, he carried on and made some more records and gained the sponsorship money. Later the transformational Dasha of Rahu-Venus made him achieve even more. There were few more surprises waiting for him, and the wax statue at the Sydney Cricket Ground was one of them. On September 28, 2011, he shifted to Mumbai’s posh Bandra locality as well. With his brilliant cricketing career and runs going on always, he was able to afford 40 cars. These cars include brands like BMW, a Porsche Boxster, and a Mercedes C-36; all 40 cars are placed in different properties that Sachin owns. This was also the time when Rahu-Venus Dasha made him was nominated for Rajya Sabha. In November 2013, he was honored by the “Bharat Ratna,” which is considered the highest civilian award of the country. On November 16, 2013, he got his retirement from all kinds of games of cricket, which was justified with the Rahu-Venus-Ketu time in Vimshottari as Ketu was in the twelfth house of retirement. If you also want to explore your future predictions, contact a professional astrologer.

The day happens in the month of Dhanurmasam (December-January) as the Sun runs in the Dhanu Rashi. Temples like Tirupati Balaji, Srirangam Sri Ranganatha, Bhadrachalam, which are at different places in South India, celebrate the Ekadashi on a grand level.It is very much believed that on this day, Lord Vishnu opens up the gates of heaven. Devotees who worship Lord Vishnu and pass through the abode gate made in temples seek Moksha after this lifetime. They become free from the cycle of life and death and reside in the Vishnu abode as a result of their good karmas.Different temples in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana open this special gate only on . The queue of devotees encircles the altar of Lord Vishnu while passing through the gate.Observing fast on the DayDevotees who keep fast on this day attain the benefits of all Ekadashis that fall in Krishna and Shukla Paksha. However, the Vrats are observed like any other Ekadashi during which people can consume one meal only. Those who observe fasting more strictly avoid having any food items. Also, one must not pluck Tulsi leaves on this day; if needed, it should be done a day before.It is prohibited to consume rice on any Ekadashi since it is believed as the home of the demon on Ekadashi. People also stay awake all night, and they indulge in Bhajana and Kirtan or chant the Mahamantra of Krishna, an avatar of Lord Vishnu.One should not sleep during the daytime, and if possible, watch the all-night reading stories related to Lord Vishnu. The Vrat should be broken the next day, on Dwadasi after performing the Puja, and donating food to the poor.Mythological Connection Behind Vaikunta EkadasiAs the Padma Purana indicates, Ekadashi is the female energy of Lord Vishnu that once saved Lord Vishnu from the irrational and murderous act of the demon Muran. This happened during the month of Margazhi when the Sun was in Sagittarius or DhanuRashi.The legend states that Muran, a demon, was spreading his domination in heaven and among the Gods-like. Unable to bear his oppression, all Devas approached Lord Shiva, who then directed them to Lord Vishnu. Vishnu attended the Gods-like and decided to terminate the demon forever.The war went on between and the demon Muran. However, it was getting challenging to triumph over the demon. Lord Vishnu then took a break from the war and went to a cave to prepare an upgraded and mighty weapon. One night when Lord Vishnu was slumbering, the demon exposed the gut to outbreak Lord Vishnu.Right away, the female energy from within Lord Vishnu took her form and slain the demon into pieces on the ground. Lord Vishnu, when realized the life-saving act of her energy, he gave her the name “Ekadashi.” He also gave her the boon that whoever will worship her and go through the gate of abode will attain Moksha or the abode of Vishnu.Since then, to seek salvation from the materialistic world, devotees worship Lord Vishnu on this very day. Plus, they stay awake the whole night, read the mythological stories about Vishnu, and observe fast with utmost devotion. Observing fast on this single day has the power to offer the devotees the effects of all the Ekadashis together.Fasting cleanses our minds as we become able to fight our shallow thoughts and ill-words that we use for others. Even it is just for a day, by fasting, we remind ourselves that we don’t have to bring negative thoughts. Here our Rajasic and Tamasic qualities are a depiction of the demon Muran that we need to defeat with the light of positivity and the vibe of devotion we receive while fasting on Vaikunta Ekadasi.Let the feeling of lust, arrogance, and anger diminish this . Observe the fast on VaikuntaEkadasi and receive the blessings of Lord Vishnu in your life. Let your mind be in the service of Vishnu!Astropedia brings you information about different fasting rules on different days.

The couple flew to Cancun for their wedding anniversary and spend $18,000.00 for a two-bedroom, one week timeshare 10 years ago. They have used it once.Last winter, Ron was laid off from his semi-retired job, he started looking on the internet for ways to sell their timeshare and recover at least part of their purchase.

{"heading": "Ten Profound Life Lessons to Learn From Buddhism", "author": "Janvi Tyagi", "description": "Buddhism was founded by an Indian religious, spiritual preacher and philosopher", "word-count": 779, "body": "Always Be Positive &amp; Never Lose HopeBuddhism emphasised on always being hopeful despite one's being in tough times. It mentions that nothing is permanent in life i.e. be it happiness, sadness or even one's identity. 'Change' is the law of nature, and all bad situations would pass off one day and bring happiness to life again. Everyone is doing his own karma according to his own will &amp; hopes. Hence, one should always be optimistic about life.On the off chance,if you are facing negative thoughts daily,then meditate in front of a buddha statue for 20 minutes and keep your worries at bay. Helping Other GenerouslyOne other important doctrine of Buddhism was helping the needy to the maximum extent. It specifies that despite one's problems, one should help others which shall make you feel happy. The power of giving has an immense impact. It not only reduces the misery of a person but generates true strength in oneself. Thus, one should always bring happiness to others' lives so that their own life always remains happy. Compassion and Sharing with others are two key factors to one's happiness. Free Yourself From AttachmentsBuddhism stipulates that one should be self-reliant and not rely on external factors for attaining happiness. It further establishes that one should go on doing his karma in life, without being dependent on others. All relations and assets in life are replenishable. One should not be attached to worldly gains and relations as they tend to deprive you of your freedom. Therefore, accept life with enthusiasm, and worship buddha idol daily to grow in life with happiness, without being attached emotionally. Death, Decay, losses are various aspects of life, and a wise person would not grieve as this is the law of nature. Whatever situations in life prevail, one should walk untouched and unattached. Understanding Is the Key to ProgressProgress in one's life comes through Understanding. One should understand various aspects of life and show compassion for one and all irrespective of the fact that there may be a difference in opinions/insight/views. Your karma, based on your understanding, shall fetch happiness in your life. Changing Your Life Is Entirely in Your HandsYour life is only yours, and you have to walk the path bravely, understandingly and with great wisdom to attain your goals in life. One has to conquer one's own self to attain happiness in life. One cannot rely on others for making a path in their life. You have to conquer your mind &amp; ego and move forward positively &amp; humbly with fixed perspectives, great courage, calmness and patience. One should not forget that 'There is no path to happiness – Rather Happiness is the path. Trust Your Common SenseIn this fast changing world, where everything has been aesthetically commercialised and presented lucratively, one has to trust one's own common sense. The skills acquired in life need to be practically established, and without relying on others, one should co-relate the same to its common sense to derive the desired happiness/result from the same.  Holding Onto Anger Isn't UsefulBuddhism enfolds the power of patience and teaches us to keep ego and anger away from you to lead a joyful life. It propagates that anger does not lead you to anything positive or concrete – rather, it decreases your happiness, energy and peace. Any situation can be faced by avoiding anger and instead of practising tolerance and patience. Our great Scholars have rightly said that we shall not be punished for our anger, but shall be punished by our anger. Do Not Stoop to Anyone's LevelBuddhism taught people to practice patience and conquer hate with love and passion. People often tend to provoke you. But you need not come down to their levels and act accordingly. Instead, by practising patience, cool and wisdom, you may win over them; convert their hatred to love while keeping your integrity intact. For practising the principle taught in buddhism, buy buddha statue online and meditate daily. To Be Beautiful Means to Be YourselfBuddhism teaches that one can become a beautiful human being through self-compassion, being morally high, nourishing the body with the right food, always ready to help the needy etc. Such a person knows his targets to be achieved during his journey in life. He happily accepts whatever comes his way. The Moment Is the Only Thing That ExistsBuddhism emphasizes the fact that the past is already over and the future is yet to come. So, the most important thing that matters is the present moment for a person to live in. Hence, one should utilise every moment of his current life to work and enjoy so that the future automatically gets better.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/religion/ten-profound-life-lessons-to-learn-from-buddhism.html"},

Obviously, the salespeople do not want to incur a loss on having the potential client walk away with the free gifts without making a purchase. As such, the timeshare salespeople are very motivated by their commission structure to ensure that the client makes a timeshare purchase.The sales team is carefully trained to target the right type of vacationer to attend the timeshare presentations. For example, they normally approach people over 30 years of age, in couples, as they assume that they will have two stable incomes and be able to afford to vacation regularly or purchase a timeshare. The salespeople that work in timeshare scams companies normally try to sell the timeshare for the highest amount possible, but when they are not successful, many companies will offer a smaller vacation club package.Timeshares do not have a fixed value. The salespeople from timeshare scam companies are very skilled at gathering information about the client during the free breakfast and initial survey in order to assess the client´s financial status and ultimately, the price that they will offer the timeshare. When the client refuses, they offer deep discounts to entice the client to purchase, and often send in a closer to make the special “one day only” deal. They may promise offers of guaranteed rentals, resales, or annuities, which are some of the most common timeshare scams, to entice the clients to purchase; however, some clients are more persistent at saying no, and refusing to buy the timeshare.The salespeople offer vacations club packages as a cheaper alternative to a timeshare to the vacationers who say they cannot afford a fixed timeshare or a high value package.The vacation clubs normally work on a points system and the salesperson makes claims that the points can be used at hotels throughout the world. The timeshares salesperson from the timeshare scam companies state that the vacation club offers the client deep discounts on travel, such as reduced airfares, very cheap weekly hotel rates, discounted rental cars and many more excellent benefits. These packages are offered at a fraction of the price of a timeshare, often just a few thousand dollars, so the clients who were not interested in a large timeshare package, but are interested in having more affordable travel opportunities, are persuaded into buying. Unfortunately, these packages are another version of timeshare fraud as what the timeshare salesperson promises is not what is actually offered to the client once they return home and try to use the vacation club.During the sales presentation the salesperson shows the client a detailed book of all the vacation club benefits. Normally, clients will ask for a copy so that they can review it while they are still on vacation. The salesperson will say that the book will be mailed to the client at their home address so that they do not have to carry a heavy book with them on their trip home. Often, the package of information never arrives, or in cases where the client does receive the book, it is a different version. The version of the book that the client receives offers far less hotel options, requires a higher points value per night, and does not offer the other discounts promised during the time share scam sales presentation. Read this to avoid becoming a victim of timeshare scams in Mexico or by a vacation club scams.Even if you have purchased a timeshare scam in Mexico, and it is already past your 5 day rescission period, we may be able to help.  at Mexican Timeshare Solutions for your free consultation to assess your situation and advise you of how you can get out of your timeshare contract as soon as possible. To learn more about services for timesharevictims, visit:<b></b><b>About Mexican Timeshare Solutions:</b>Our goal is to assisttimeshare purchasers who feel they were scammed or taken advantage of byfraudulent salespeople.

{"heading": "How To Spot A Phony Psychic", "author": "Carolyn Molnar", "description": "Make sure you know how to spot a psychic scam artist. A phychic's job is to advise. Beware of those who offer a lucky spell to fix your life or scare you into parting with your money.", "word-count": 491, "body": "As a psychic medium who’s proud of her work, I get disgusted and angry whenever I hear about phony clairvoyants whose only aim is to hoodwink people out of their money or, worse, their sense of power. I hope you never fall prey into a spider web cast by a devious intuitive. And to make sure you don’t, here’s how to spot a psychic scam artist. 1. The scammer says you’re cursed, and only they can remove this curse.There is no such thing as a curse. No one can give you the evil eye unless you believe it. And when you believe someone has the power to make bad things happen to you, your belief system turns your fears into reality. As Eleanor Roosevelt said, “No one can make you feel bad without your permission.”2. The scammer wants a ridiculous amount of money for a session.Many psychics base their rates on their notoriety. Expect to pay The Long Island Medium or John Edward several hundred dollars for a session. Don’t pay that kind of money to an unknown psychic with a neon crystal ball in the storefront window.3.The scammer says you need more sessions with them to clear away your problem.Bogus mystics often offer a free first reading, or charge just $20 to lure you in. But then they’ll tell you you’re cursed and need to come back again – and again – at $100 a pop.4.The scammer says you need to give them your money “to clean.”Don’t laugh. I’ve heard stories from doctors and lawyers who have handed over tens of thousands of dollars because they were told their money was cursed and unclean. And once that happened, their money was gone with the wind.5.The scammer says you must buy their “mystical trinkets.”I’ve given readings and suggested to clients they might want to carry a certain stone on their person to help ground them. I’ve also suggested books for clients to read, like Louise Hay’s You Can Heal Your Life. But there’s a world of difference between a $5 stone (I don’t carry anything for sale in my office) or a book that you can also get out of a library, and $150 candles scammers sell that, after burning, will “clear away negative energy.” Believe me, you feel plenty positive after burning a $2.50 vanilla-scented votive available just about anywhere.6.The scammer tells you that you have no power.You are the most powerful person you know. Why? Because you have the strength to say “No!” Never give your power away to anyone – especially someone masquerading as a psychic.A psychic is supposed to advise, not give you a lucky spell to fix your life or make doom-and-gloom pronouncements. People who want their problems to be magically fixed are in danger of becoming victims – because they give away their hope and power. Believe me, working to improve your life is just that – work. Lucky Charms should only be for breakfast.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/scams/how-to-spot-a-phony-psychic.html"},

If you are like millions of small-business owners, you probably cannot imagine how a cyber criminal halfway around the world could possibly cause your business to suffer a data security breach.", "word-count": 651, "body": "6 Important Small Business Cyber Security TipsChances are, you think twice before entering your credit card information online to buy something, watch out for malicious links in emails and keep your PC updated against viruses, spyware and hackers.However, how much thought do you put into your small business data security and protecting client information?Hopefully a lot, because according to Microsoft:• An attacker resides within a network for an average of 146 days before detection• The average cost of a data breach to a business is $3.8 million• The total cost of cybercrime to the global community in 2016 was $500 billion• 63 percent of attacks are the result of compromised user passwords and usernamesAs these threats continue to become more sophisticated, legislation must too. ]In Canada, many government departments such as the Department of Justice, RCMP, Public Safety Canada and Global Affairs Canada work together with international, federal and provincial law enforcement agencies against cybercrime.  That’s great, but you want to stop any potential attacks before your clients’ data security is breached!And, if you’re thinking that your site is too small to appeal to hackers, think again. Sometimes a cybercriminal’s intention isn’t to gather sensitive content, but to relay spam emails from your server.Let’s use the example of a membership site for these small business cybersecurity tips.A membership website has specific resources available for members who generally pay a one-time or recurring fee to get content such as videos, eBooks, articles or tutorials. My AMPLiFY! Business Academy is an example of this type of website.  Because people are entering sensitive information such as email addresses, passwords and payment information to access my content, we need to be vigilant about how we keep them safe from online threats. (A secure site is also more likely to earn trust, which in turn can increase revenue.) To help safeguard your clients’ data security, I suggest that you:1. Choose a reputable web host. Don’t just go for the cheapest! I compiled a list of web hosting providers that I recommend; you can view it on our website.2. Install an SSL certificate on your site. This means having HTTPS vs. HTTP in the URL. This is the prefix to your web address, and the SSL provides additional security and makes it harder for hackers to access.You can often add this service to your web hosting package for free, or for a small cost. An added bonus: a secure site can actually rank higher in Google.3. As soon as you see a new software update, install it. Many membership sites are built in WordPress, which lets you simply click the ‘Update Now’ button. This helps keep cybercriminals from taking advantage of security flaws in older versions. Similarly, look for plugins to help manage online security.  4. Enforce complex passwords. Request or even demand that users create passwords with a combo of upper and lowercase letters, symbols and numbers. This will deter people from using ‘12345’ as a password. You can also install a plugin on your WordPress site that only gives someone a number of tries to log in to before they’re locked out.5. Approve comments manually. Spammers love unattended comments! They can post links there that a) may drive traffic back to their site and b) may trick Google (however briefly) into thinking that their site has valuable content.6. Clean up information that’s no longer relevant. Previous members, people who have cancelled, those who have completed your course… get rid of user info and payment info as often as you can. By following these small business cyber security tips, you can minimize the risk that your website is going to be targeted by scammers or cybercriminals.Don’t cut corners when it comes to protecting client information, and you can create a safe space for loyal fans who feel comfortable handing over their personal and payment info.Of course, there are many more components to maintaining a secure website.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/scams/the-serious-job-of-protecting-client-information.html"},

Here, typically the developer will reveal, the particular possible buyer, a piece of land on which his project signboard is displayed. Yet, typically the land either doesn’t belong to him or her or he doesn’t have the official clearances for that land in question. It's prudent not to buy attributes which have no foundation laid.

{"heading": "Facts That You Should Know About a Diminished Value Appraisal in New Hampshire", "author": "mianahmad", "description": "If you’ve never heard of a", "word-count": 461, "body": "What Leads to a Diminished Value? Essentially, diminished value occurs when a car, truck, or motorcycle sustains damage that lowers the overall worth. The event could be the result of a severe traffic accident. Diminished value may come about because of damage caused by the negligence of another party. Even acts of nature, such as flooding, can mean that the vehicle is no longer worth the same amount. Do Insurance Companies Take Diminished Value Into Consideration? Most auto insurance providers do ask questions that are intended to determine if the value of the vehicle has decreased for some reason. Along with information gathered from the vehicle owner, many carriers also obtain permission to research the history of the vehicle. This makes it possible to determine if some event took place that left the vehicle with serious damage. In that scenario, the amount of benefits and the scope of coverage that the insurance company is willing to extend may be limited. Why Does Diminished Value Matter if I’m Purchasing a Used Vehicle? If you’re thinking of purchasing a previously owned vehicle, it makes sense to arrange for a thorough inspection. That inspection can determine if there is something wrong with the vehicle that seriously affects the total market value. For example, that inspection will uncover any evidence that the vehicle was in an accident that bent or otherwise damaged the frame. You can also expect the inspection to identify any signs that the vehicle was involved in a flood situation. With both of these examples, the findings will indicate the vehicle is not worth the same amount as a similar make and model that has not been through a severe accident or immersed in water as the result of a flood. Does Diminished Value Mean the Vehicle is Worthless? Diminished value does not mean that the car, truck, or motorcycle is not worth considering. What it does mean is that you should be careful to not pay more for that vehicle than the figure quoted as part of the appraisal. It’s quite possible that the repairs made resulted in a vehicle that’s safe to drive for several more years. Only you can determine if a vehicle with diminished value can provide the benefits that you seek. If the goal is to invest in something that will get you to and from work each day, purchasing that vehicle may be fine. Should you be in the market for something that you can take on road trips several times a year, do look closely at the inspection results and determine if the vehicle is likely to require a lot of additional upkeep. If you feel that the purchase price and the projected repairs are within reason, buying the vehicle may be the right move.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/science/facts-that-you-should-know-about-a-diminished-value-appraisal-in-new-hampshire.html"},

Meaning that when there is nuclear energy, there will be high levels of dangerous nuclear waste, or also known as radioactive waste.

Because it is a lot cleaner than other power plants that are polluting the air a lot.

Something that will not make nuclear energy beneficial to smaller countries.The importance of disposing of nuclear waste correctlyAs said before, with nuclear energy plants comes nuclear waste. And, the waste needs to be disposed of correctly. But, the question is why and how do they dispose of it correctly?The nuclear waste is radioactive. Meaning that it is really dangerous to all living things. This includes plants and animals as well. The containers should be air-tight and should not be able to damage over time. Nuclear waste can be harmful to hundreds of years. It should also be closed in such a way that the containers can never be open again.Disposal sites of nuclear can’t ever be used again for any other purposeThis is the saddest part of it all. Once you have used a piece of land for the disposal of nuclear waste or radioactive waste, then you can’t use the site for anything else, ever again. This is because the area will be radioactive, no matter how tight the containers have been closed.It takes hundreds of years before one container isn’t active anymore. Meaning that only after a couple of hundred years after the last nuclear waste has been dumped there, the site will be suitable for usage again. And, only if the site isn’t radioactive anymore.These are just a couple of facts about nuclear energy and nuclear plants. The most important thing that any country should consider is the nuclear waste that these nuclear energy plants are producing. The waste is harmful and can kill a lot of people.

There isn’t much downtime for nuclear energy to be produced. Meaning that towns and countries that have nuclear energy don’t have to deal with power outages all the time.When nuclear energy has downtime, there is enough energy to keep the lights on for hours before people are starting to feel the effect of the nuclear power station being down. Not like when a normal power station is down.It gives less air pollutionThis is one of the main reasons why people are starting to consider nuclear energy. Because of the air pollution that will be a lot less. Yes, there are some radioactive waste that needs to be disposed of, but if it is done correctly, there isn’t any danger of the waste causing pollution.Air pollution is something that many countries are struggling with. And, there are many dangers to this pollution that you need to consider. The less air pollution a country has, the fewer health problems people will struggle with.More affordable to produceSomething that people don’t know is that nuclear energy is more affordable to produce than normal energy. This is if you are excluding the build of the power stations. Nuclear power stations are more expensive to build but cheaper to produce than normal power stations.There are many things that will let the price of nuclear energy go up or down. But, in general, you will see that it is still cheaper and more affordable than other forms of energy. The reason why countries can’t afford to produce nuclear energy is the fact that building the power station is expensive and it is hard to find the right place for radioactive waste.Modern nuclear plants are saferIn the first couple of years of producing nuclear energy, people were worried about the safety of the workers. Because of radioactive waste that might spill and cause workers to get sick.This isn’t the same today. The modern nuclear plants are much safer to work in. There are more precautions taken with radioactive waste so that it doesn’t get spilled or leaked. The dangers are less for the workers and the people living in the area.Problems and disadvantages with nuclear energyEven with all the advantages of using nuclear energy, there are some problems and disadvantages that you need to know as well. The radioactive waste that these plants are producing needs to be disposed of correctly and safely. And, as we said before it is expensive to build nuclear power plants.These are some of the most important advantages and some disadvantages of nuclear energy. This will let you understand nuclear energy a lot better. There are many people that are against nuclear energy, and this is just because they don’t know the facts and benefits of it. The advantages are a lot more than the disadvantages and problems that nuclear energy can have. It is more affordable, more reliable, and for sure safer than a couple of years ago.

It is very important that you choose a different long tail keyword phrase for each post you make.  Each blog post is equivalent to a new page, so that is why you will want to make sure that you optimize each blog post for a different keyword phrase. Select keyword phrases that have low competition and only a few searches per month.  I really do mean only a few searches i.e. 30 – 300 monthly searches.  If you are consistently and regularly posting on your blog the few visitors you get for each post will soon add up over time.Add your keyword phrase in the title and two or three times in the actual post.  If you add an image to your blog post you can add the keyword phrase in the alt image tag as well.  If you are using an SEO plugin on your blog, be sure to add the title, description and keyword phrase in the form provided.You can monetize each post by linking to one of the online business opportunities, an affiliate product or home business ideas you are promoting.  Or an alternative way to monetize is to blend Google Adsense ads into your blog posts.Then a further step you can take to push your posts even higher up in the rankings is to write an article related to the theme of your blog post and distribute it to the article directories.  In the resource box use two links, i.e. firstly link to the home page of your blog with your blog’s main keywords and secondly, be sure that you link to the actual post on your blog that you want to rank higher with the keyword phrase you optimized that blog post for.If you follow these simple steps you will have many of your blog posts on page one of the search results which will result in increased traffic and sales.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/se-positioning/how-to-get-high-rankings-for-your-blog-posts.html"},

Besides, what are the chances that your prospective clients will key in, exactly, those keywords that you chose in, precisely, those same search engines that you have targeted to locate your website within the first page of results?", "word-count": 1206, "body": "If placing your website within the top search engine results, entering certain keywords in Google, Yahoo, MSN Search, or Alta Vista, has become your daily obsession, stop for a moment and reflect. Is achieving top search results with selected keywords the real objective, or, is it perhaps developing a means for connecting with your potential customers, thus attracting more qualified traffic to your web site, what you are truly after? Besides, what are the chances that your prospective clients will key in, exactly, those keywords that you chose in, precisely, those same search engines that you have targeted to locate your website within the first page of results?Now that the majority of website administrators have finally accepted that online marketing applying search engine technology is the most efficient strategy in the long term for capturing qualified Internet traffic, companies that offer web optimization and search engine submission services have started launching aggressive campaigns guaranteeing top positions for their clients by using a limited number of keywords (typically five, ten, or fifteen), regardless of their websites’ business domain. This approach should immediately raise doubts as it is obviously much easier to position a website dedicated, for example, to the dissection of butterflies, that probably enjoys very little competition, than positioning a website dedicated to real estate operating in an extremely crowded market. Therefore, one must always carefully weigh in the promises made by these web-positioning firms since two different scenarios could occur:- In order to achieve the promised top search results, a web-positioning company may be forced to choose keywords that are so exclusive and specific that even if your website surfaces among the first few spots, the chances of a prospective client typing those exact keywords is extremely remote.- On the other hand, a client may demand from the web-positioning company the utilization of keywords that are so generic and belong to such a highly competitive business domain that the web-positioning company is unable to realize their promises even after applying all the proper techniques correctly.This raises the question of whether the mechanisms currently employed for determining the success or failure of a web positioning strategy are adequate, or, perhaps, better alternatives exist. In most cases, web-positioning companies justify their success by providing periodic web positioning reports to their clients. These automatically generated reports show the positions achieved by each of the selected keywords with every search engine targeted. Software programs repeatedly launch queries once a week, or once a month, with each of the search concepts using all the search engines selected, capturing the results and presenting them in weekly or monthly reports. The customers review these reports and apply their information as the only basis for determining the level of success, which brings us back to the original question: Is achieving a good positioning the real objective, or is it using web positioning as just another means for obtaining more qualified traffic the intended goal?From my perspective, attracting qualified Internet traffic should be the ultimate goal of any online marketing strategy, from web positioning to online advertising, including email strategies, permission marketing, or pay-per-click campaigns. That is why marketing professionals should be using web traffic reports as the true indicators of their online marketing success, as opposed to relying solely on the information provided by web positioning reports. Even though these latter reports can offer a good indication of where a website would appear if certain keywords were used in a search engine, the cornerstone for determining how well a website is actually performing comes from analyzing the real-time statistics provided by web traffic reports. Let’s analyze next some of the reasons that make these reports such an invaluable asset.- A potential customer can locate a website entering such a large variety of keywords, phrases, synonyms, misspelled words, expressions, etc. that limiting the positioning of a website to the utilization of five, ten, fifteen, or even twenty keywords would not begin to cover the spectrum of possibilities available to any Internet user.- The origins of prospective clients are typically so diverse that adopting an online marketing strategy that simply positions a website for a limited number of search engines would greatly reduce the chances of capturing additional audiences frequenting areas such as forums, user groups, e-mails, newsletters, referrals, chat rooms, blogs, online articles, etc. Even though, in most cases, Google, for example, generates over 75% of the traffic referrals for a website, it is important to note that external referrals to a website from areas such as forums or newsletters are also taken into consideration by Google and other search engines while positioning a website. A complete web positioning strategy should therefore take into consideration external website referrals due to the effect that they have on the overall positioning and also because these referrals are excellent sources for directing more qualified traffic to a website.- A web positioning report illustrates the ranking that a website would obtain if the keywords chosen by us were submitted to the list of search engines also selected by us. A web traffic report, on the other hand, shows exactly how a prospective customer found our website (i.e. shows both the keywords typed in by the customer and the search engine used by the customer.)- A web positioning report shows the spot that could be achieved, but provides little insight on how to improve the results obtained. One of the many features of a web traffic report is the ability to capture what specific keywords and corresponding search engines generated the majority of the visits to a website, or those that actually converted visits into real customers. This continuous feedback provided by the web traffic reports is an excellent mechanism to fine-tune search concepts and improve their effectiveness.- Web traffic reports can also be utilized to analyze how the popularity of a particular search concept evolves over time and how new trends or concepts are born. This information enables the incorporation of new niche keywords that will improve the positioning of a website not only by reducing the scope of a search, but also by increasing the chances that a potential customer will select those keywords.- Finally, a web traffic report also lists all the external referring entities (e.g., forums, chat rooms, blogs, etc.); information that will prove invaluable for expanding a web positioning strategy and enhancing its vision for a more global reach.Attracting qualified Internet traffic to a website (i.e. customers that are interested in the products or services being offered) ought to be the ultimate goal of any online marketing strategy. This effort cannot be simply limited to the selection of a series of search keywords and engines, all chosen beforehand. Instead, a more global approach must be adopted that encompasses web optimization, search engine submissions, inclusion of references in external areas such as forums, user groups or value-added portals, the publication of articles, and the contribution of content to other websites. This expanded strategy will enhance our overall Internet presence and will enable the most popular search engines to locate a website applying a greater variety of search concepts. Lastly, by applying the feedback obtained from the web traffic reports, our global Internet presence can be continually improved and sustained to ensure consistent and effective results.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/se-positioning/what-is-your-real-goal-web-positioning-with-top-results-or-the-ability-to-attract-more-qualified-traffic-to-your-website.html"},

Google's convenient first archive is by and by a reality, which recommends it's drawing its outcomes from adaptable improved destinations first, instead of territories arranged to work stations. On the off chance that your site isn't convenient overhauled, you danger getting senselessly under-ranked. Huge amounts of the SEO ranking components we'll take a gander at in this article will help you with building up the framework for a decent search engine ranking, yet you additionally need to consider client experience when individuals land on your site.  Did you comprehend that about 60% of the regions that have a rule ten Google search ranking are three years of age or more? Information from an Ahrefs investigation of 2,000,000 pages proposes that generally, hardly any destinations not really a year old accomplish that ranking. So on the occasion that you've had your site for a long time, and have advanced it utilizing the tips in this article, is beginning at now a supported position. Once in a while, the zone name matters. Despite the way that Google has repelled positive match domains (those where the objective keyword is in the URL), that control is commonly for repulsive regions with weak content. Research from Moz shows that definite match spaces that are considered to be huge, essential, and high-bore can see a ranking list as a result of it. Nonetheless, in the event that you beginning at now have a created site, you don't have to go searching for a careful match space for your business. The best course for picking your space?

Moz has portrayed this into page authority and space authority scores, both ranked from 0 to 100, which uncover to you how likely a specific page or region is to rank in search results.  We said before that getting the code right is one bit of updating content for better search engine rankings. This can be unnerving, particularly in the function that you're considerably more a researcher and to a lesser extent a 'geek.' Here is a portion of the viewpoints you can control whether you're not a coder:- Fuse keyword phrases in page titles, which is the spot Google first intends to figure out which content is suitable to which search- Use header imprints to show content progression beginning with your title at h1 and a brief timeframe later use h2 or h3 for subheads- Make a meta description that the two bids perusers and breakers your keyword expression- Keep those meta descriptions short and powerful at around 160 characters- Use keyword phrases in picture alt names to show how those photographs are pertinent to the vital content- Join alt marks in like way help individuals who are apparently debilitated exploit your site with screenreaders- Use graph markup to mention to Google what sort of content you're conveying  For a long time eventually, Google's been utilizing man-made consciousness to all the practically certain rank site pages.

That additionally recommends you must have not many inbound links from inferior quality regions. You can locate your inbound links utilizing an instrument like SEMrush or one of the keyword research contraptions shared before in this guide.  Simultaneously, you need to show that you're making quality content for your guests.

Frankly, for the success of your customers, you ought to evidently be doing this notwithstanding to guarantee you to give the most worth.  At long last, linking to your own content can help arrange pages for both Google and your guests, making each page more huge. On the off chance that you have a definitive page and link to another page on your site, that enables your guests to locate the other page furthermore passes on some power. This assists with seconding page help with searching engine ranking. As you make new content, cause sure to produce a strong catch of inside links so your pages to can keep up one another.

Google's official word is that social offers are not an immediate ranking component. Links from Twitter or Facebook aren't considered near links from other real regions. In any case, there's no excusing that the most brought ranking pages up in Google search results, overall, have plenty of offers. Despite the way, this is more than likely a consequence of a couple of related components:- More social offers make more traffic to the page itself- More offers additionally make your content bound to gather backlinks  This last tip is basic for organizations focusing in on express areas. The closeness or nonappearance of business information is one of the most fundamental closes by SEO ranking components.

You must be searching for the reason for such behavior. Try to remember whether the  you chose in the past focused on link building for your website to gain good ranks. If “yes” then it is most likely that Penguin has found unnatural backlinks to your site.  Now what? You can definitely recover your website and be there at the top of Google’s search engine just be dealing with the site a bit intelligently.Knowing the Penguin betterThe Penguin algorithm of Google was launched on 24th April 2012. There were many digital marketing companies that tried to gain Google’s trust and ranks by creating too many unnatural links to the client sites. This, in turn, created a poor user experience. The main aim of the Penguin algorithm was to look for sites having unnatural backlinks.Did you make a grave mistake by doing link building?Absolutely not! Links are important to ensure that your site is trustworthy. If any reputed site links to yours, this is seen as a recommendation and is definitely good for your business. However, many SEO professionals in the past tried to manipulate the algorithm to create a bunch of self-made links to the site to increase the number of backlinks. The professionals would collect links from easy-to-get places and choose links from places like self-created content sites, directory listings, and put links in comments and forum posts. These techniques are a passé now.Penguin is capable of detecting these kinds of low-quality links and would affect the ranking of the site if the links are not of high quality or from reputed and trustworthy sites. In such a situation Google sees your site as untrustworthy and reduces its rankings. The position of a site on the search engine is inversely proportional to the amount of link manipulation that has been done.Recovery from Penguin hitPenguin, just like other algorithms of Google, is re-run and updated regularly. Each of the sites is re-evaluated every time there is an update. There is a certain gap between two updates. So, during this time you could make the necessary corrections to your website. The top digital agencies in Mumbai can help your website go high up in rank when the next time it is crawled at the time of an update.

Once everything is clear and checked, your site is ready for facing the next update, which could let it win over Google’s trust.Remember, that Penguin algorithm is not similar to manual unnatural links penalty. Unlike the later, Penguin does not require a reconsideration request to recover websites. There is also no need to document the work done to remove the links. During a Penguin algorithm update, every website is crawled by bots and not by humans. Thus, it works differently than the manual links penalty.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/se-positioning/how-can-an-internet-marketing-company-recover-your-site-from-penguin-hit.html"},

But, creating unique and powerful content is not everyone’s cup of tea. At least, it’s not easy to do if you don’t follow the right strategies. For instance, to get the attention of your audience, you have to make sure they have something to consume. Unique, informative, and tightly-woven content is consuming content.However, in SEO, just publishing a couple of content won’t do much good for your website in the long run. To secure a good position for your website and to make sure it doesn’t drop from that position, you must create those contents continuously.But how to do that? How do we create unique content on the same topic over and over again? The answer is: find yourself a free paraphrasing tool online.Because using a paraphrasing tool is one of those strategies that will lift up your website ranking by aiding you with great and unique content. What is paraphrasing? In simple words, paraphrasing means to change the words and phrases of a statement while keeping the meaning the same as before. Paraphrasing is used in many spheres of our life. In delivering speeches, writing theories, composing assignments, content writing, and so many other ways paraphrasing gets used. What is the purpose of the free paraphrasing tool online? There are a few things that you should take care of while writing for publishing. And the concept of paraphrasing helps you in those matters. By using a free paraphrasing tool online you can ensure a healthy and safe writing environment.  One of the most unethical things one can do is stealing someone’s idea and making it their own, i.e. copyright infringement. It is not wrong to take inspiration from other’s work but take that inspiration artfully. Try subtlety over explicitness. Make sure your writing does not abuse the copyright act by using a paraphrasing tool. A paraphrasing tool will change original words and phrases and even the sentences but still express the same emotion of the original content.  In SEO, you will need to provide high-quality content nonstop. It sounds scary but is not impossible if you have a good free paraphrasing tool online at your disposal. You can create an article and use it in different places by recycling it with the free paraphrasing tool. Since the tool returns a unique result every time you use it, you won’t have to fear the content being similar to previous results. What’s the best way to use a free paraphrasing tool online for powerful content? While you are using a paraphrase generator, there are a few pointers that you should keep in mind. These pointers will help you generate not only unique content but also SEO –friendly content. If you can learn to tweak some things, then the content won’t seem too foreign, instead, it will have a unique style that is your own. When you use the paraphrase generator, it will give you unique content and will show where the changes took place. Some paraphrasing tools like ’  have an option that allows you to change the words to your liking. For that, all you have to do is hover on the word you want to change. The free paraphrasing tool online will then suggest similar words from which you can choose the one you need, or you can add your own word to suit the context.  Good paraphrasing tools understand natural language quite well. But, there are some limitations when it comes to retaining keywords. For instance, if you have a key phrase “best paraphrasing tool” in your content, the tool might change it into “superior paraphrasing device”. While, the meaning of both phrases are the same, but you have to keep the keywords unchanged for SEO’s sake.So check that your keywords are the same as before when you rewrite your content.  The free paraphrasing tool online always produces unique content.

User experience is what matters the most when it comes to SEO as the goal of Google is to provide an excellent user experience. Content is crucial, but how the users experience the content is what matters more. Because having the best content in the world will not matter if the users leave due to slow loading pages, pop-ups, and more.The Total Package Matters- If the content is what matters the most, you can just create quality content, sit back, and watch as the organic traffic increases and an increase in the revenue.

Many of them wish they’d learned to develop – and then trust – their intuitive abilities a lot sooner. Instead, they listened to their parents/siblings/friends/spouse/school teacher/religious leader/ (pick relevant one or several) and convinced themselves that their perceptive insights were irrelevant.Think about it: How many times have you promised yourself you’d take that vacation, learn a new skill, try writing that novel, or begin that exercise regimen? It’s never too late until it’s too late. As Nike says, “Just do it!”2) I wish I didn’t work so hard.I applaud people who work hard to support their family, and even take a second job to make their kids’ lives easier. But how much money buys enough happiness, and when does the need for financial security lead to insecurity?One of my clients, Raj, was so concerned about not making enough money that he worked himself into a heart attack. His hard labours were for an admirable reason – he wanted to provide comforts for his family of five once he was gone. “But Raj,” I told him, worried because he had to take time off work to recover his health, “what’s the hurry? You’re not gone yet!” Even his father, who touched in from spirit, told him to stop and smell the curry. (His dad was quite a joker – and quite wise!)3) I wish I had the courage to express my feelings.Moira made an appointment because she wanted to hear from her mother. I centred myself, then felt the presence of an older gentleman who began talking to me about a coin collection. “And he’s showing me a striped tie that you had given him for Christmas when you were a young girl. He’s thanking you for it.”“That’s not my father,” Moira said sternly. “He collected coins. But he’d never acknowledge anyone’s kindness toward him.”“But he’s acknowledging it now,” I said. “He’s saying he loves you now, because he wasn’t able to say it while he was living.”Moira snorted. “It’s a little late for that,” she said, and asked again to hear from her mother. I felt her father’s presence shrink a bit, yet he still stayed nearby, hoping for another chance to connect with his estranged daughter.4) I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.The lyrics to this traditional Girl Guides song speak so eloquently to this: “Make new friends, but keep the old.

One of the most intriguing stories he collected was from David Maginley, a Lutheran pastor and chaplain at the Cancer Program of the Queen Elizabeth Health Sciences Center in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Maginley integrates Christianity with Buddhist practices to help him understand attitudes of fear and attachment, which comes in handy when he works with patients who are struggling with their attachments to people, their memories, and even to their body.David says he cares more about the “here” than the “hereafter.” He believes the fear of death can be so profound, many people would rather think about the afterlife, instead of confronting the pain of leaving everything we know.As a Spiritualist, I know that death isn’t the end. There is life after life, and we don’t lose our loved ones; they are with us in spirit to help and guide us, if we’re open to receiving them. Still, the transition we call death can be very frightening, which is why David stresses that the most important thing to remember is that love enables us to die feeling completely safe.David administers therapeutic touch to patients who ask for this relaxation therapy. Briefly, therapeutic touch is energy manipulation work that involves moving the hands through the patient’s energy field to reduce their pain and anxiety. In addition, the energy worker sends compassionate thoughts to the patient.“Therapeutic touch helps people experience themselves as more than physical,” he explains. “That’s an important aspect of feeling completely safe, even as they die.”David tells the story of a 14-year-old cancer patient who enjoyed receiving therapeutic touch. Unfortunately, the aggressive cancer spread through his body, and he went into coma. Doctors sedated him and the family asked David to give their son one last treatment.“The family gathered on one side of the bed, and I stood on the other side,” David remembers. His voice softens as he continues: “I centred myself until I was aware of only me and the young man. I felt a deep sense of fear within him, and sent him thoughts of love and compassion as I moved my hands around his body.“His breathing became shallower as his fear seemed to subside, and I began to weep. When I looked up, I saw the family’s minister standing with them on the other side of the bed. I told him he could take over and he said, ‘It’s okay, you’re doing good, keep going.’“I finished the treatment with a sense of deep love, and felt the boy’s spirit say Thank you. I stepped away from the bed and told the family I felt the boy had sensed their love, and it helped dissolve his fear. His parents asked for some time with their son, so the minister and I stepped out of room. The boy died a few moments later in his parents’ arms. They came out of the room weeping and grateful.”David reflects for a few moments. “Too many people die feeling scared of pain, or they’re afraid they’ll encounter profound isolation as they spiral into darkness. The important thing to remember is that in love and connection, we feel safe. It’s possible to die feeling completely safe.”", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/metaphysical/a-hospice-story.html"},

Training programs are inevitable for organizations that aim at reaching their objectives effortlessly. Training is intended to fill in the gap between the present and expected skills of the employees. Now, training courses depend upon the type of training that one employee requires and the job he performs. Training is applicable both for new and existing employees. New employees need induction training to acquaint themselves with the job that they are going to perform.

So, you can easily build trust and positive relationships through effective communication.

Analytical and logical thinking are important problem-solving skills that one must possess. In addition, the employee must be flexible to produce a broad range of uncommon ideas to solve a situation.

This is in reference to Article 401 of the Federal Law number 3 of 1987 (UAE Penal Code) imposing criminal penalties for the issuer of a bounced cheque. To record a criminal case for a dishonoured cheque, the recipient must start the procedure by officially registering a grievance with the police of the specific emirate against the issuer of the cheque. In Dubai, the recipient can benefit the administration of the Dubai Police mobile application in registering such grievances without stepping foot in a station.With the issuance of Law number 1 of 2017 in the Emirate of Dubai known as Criminal Law Order, has been empowered to entertain criminal cases for cheque bounce until a certain amount, without referring the matters before the court authorities. This authority is until the dishonoured cheques amount equal to or less than AED 200,000. According to this, the wrongdoers of bobbed checks will be culpable with the accompanying fines:Amount less than AED 50,000 is AED2,000Cheque amount Between AED50,000 – AED100,000 is AED5,000Cheque amounting Between AED100,000 – AED200,000 is AED10,000A Civil ActionIn UAE and almost all other countries, the criminal courts and civil courts are independent bodies of the judicial system, hence, a case for cheque bounce is a criminal as well as a civil action against the issuer of the cheque. It is important to understand that the fines issued by the criminal act for wrongdoing of issuing a dishonoured cheque will be submitted to the government and in order to obtain the cheque amount, the receiver of the cheque is obliged to register a civil case against the other party before the relevant civil courts of Dubai. In view of the proof and realities introduced by the parties, the civil court will give a judgment obliging the defaulter/issuer of the cheque to pay a sum comparable to the estimation of the cheque along with the requisite amount of interest as decided by the courts of Dubai. The civil procedure of Dubai is certainly different from other countries and thus, requires an expert Civil Lawyer of Dubai to legally represent you before the court authorities.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/law/the-story-of-a-bounced-cheque-in-dubai.html"},

Your customers can scan the code and get access to all the data linked to the code. From website and landing page links to phone numbers and email contact, you can integrate all sorts of information required to streamline your marketing efforts", "word-count": 1359, "body": "The evolution of QR codes deserves a special appreciation. Who thought these slightly evolved barcodes would become the cornerstone of marketing for small businesses. Now, QR codes are being used not only as a payment system but also as a full-fledged marketing tool. You can integrate enormous amounts of data in a small code, and users can access that data in seconds by scanning the core. In this post, we'll delve into how small and midsize businesses can use QR codes for marketing.  For those who don't know, a QR code is a modern-day barcode that stores a wide range of information. You can link a barcode to any online destination: a website, social media profile, product page, landing page, and more. When someone scans a QR code, they get directed to the code's destination, usually via the internet browser. Now comes the question, why should you use QR codes for marketing? Well, the reasons are numerous. You can use them to accept digital payments instantly. You can direct your customers to your website using QR codes. They can also be used to promote discounts and offers.But in a nutshell, the purpose of QR codes is to bridge the gap between online and offline marketing. Let's understand this with an example. You're a local retail business that sells consumer goods. You've had a presence in the region for almost a decade, and consumers see you as a trusted and reliable business. But due to COVID-19, people have stopped coming to the store. At the same time, online retail is on the rise. More people are ordering goods online. To respond to this paradigm shift, you decide to start selling online. You set up an eCommerce website and social media handles. But the next hurdle is to get people to come to your site and shop from you. SEO is becoming highly competitive, so it could be several months before your site starts ranking on SERPs. You could try paid ads on search engines and social media, but running ad campaigns is quite expensive. And in a time of recession, you would want to save money. Here's where QR codes can help. The footfall to your store could've plunged, but it wouldn't have completely stopped. There must be some consumers coming to your store. Inside the store, you can put up posters and banners showing that you're selling online. Include a QR code on the banners that link directly to your website or social media profiles. Your customers can scan the code and reach your website. The next time they want to shop from you, they could place an order online. You can also run newspaper ads showing that you're now available online. Include the QR code along with the ad, so your customers can instantly scan the code and reach your website.  We just discussed the example of how a retail business transitioning from offline to online retail can use QR codes. But that's just the beginning. Businesses can use a  to enhance their marketing efforts in a plethora of other ways. Let's discuss them in detail. As discussed in the retail example, you can link QR codes to your website or landing page. This way, whenever a customer scans the code, he'll be directed to the page. Several opportunities are available when it comes to linking web links to QR codes. The first one is, of course, your business website. Customers can scan the code and land on your website's home page. You can also link the code to a specific product page. Let's say you are running a special offer on a pair of Adidas sneakers, and the offer applies to online purchases only. To promote this offer, you can put up a large poster outside your store, showing Adidas sneakers are at a special discount if purchased online. To facilitate the purchase, you can include a QR code on the poster, which your customers can scan to land directly on the product page. Even though we live in an era of instant messages and live chats, nothing can replace the quality of a phone conversation. In fact, customers prefer brands that can be approached via phone. Ask yourself. Would you rather purchase something from a store that doesn't have a phone number or from a store that has a phone number? Maybe a product runs into some issue, and you want to confirm whether it can be replaced or not. If there's no phone support, you'd need to drive to the store to figure out what to do with your damaged product. If phone support is available, all you need to do is call and discuss the solution with customer support. But here's another problem. If you disclose your phone number in public, it would be visible to everyone, including those who aren't your customers. You may receive a lot of spam calls and messages. For that reason, many businesses don't disclose their phone number to anyone. You can resolve this hurdle by linking your phone number to a QR code. Instead of disclosing your phone number publicly, you can link it to a QR code and include the code on the bill or product package. If your customers need to contact you, they can scan the code and dial your business phone number. Using phone number QR codes, you can ensure only your customers will be able to call you. If you don't have the resources to offer phone support, you can also use email, live chat, or text message to interact with your customers. But like the phone number, sharing your email and other contact information could be an invitation to spammers. You can resolve this issue by linking your contact information to QR codes. When customers scan the code, they'll be directed to email, live chat, or any other form of communication as per your choice. Social presence is critical in today's digital world. Consumers are using social media not just as a place to interact with their friends but also as a channel to engage with brands. Having a social media presence will enable you to stay in touch with your customers. You can share new offers and deals and encourage your customers to shop from you. At the same time, you can also use social media as a customer service channel to resolve queries and gather feedback. But customers don't really have the time to open their social media account, search for your business, and follow you. You can shorten this journey by linking a QR code to your social media account. The rise of mobile commerce is no longer a mystery. Studies have suggested that mobile commerce could overtake desktop sales by 2025. For businesses, this indicates a sudden need for mobile selling. But even if you develop a mobile commerce app, it would take significant work to encourage people to download it. One way to increase app downloads is by promoting it in your store. You can have put up a QR code linked to your mobile app. Therefore, your users can scan the code and download the app.Maps can be tricky. There are multiple spots and locations from the same name in the same city. You certainly don't want your customers to search for you and end up shopping from somewhere else. You can provide your accurate address to customers through a QR code. When a customer scans the code, he'll be redirected to the navigation mode to your store. You can share this code with display and print advertisements. If you have multiple locations in the city, you can also put up a QR code for all the sites in your store itself. When it comes to marketing, QR codes allow you to share all forms of data. Your customers can scan the code and get access to all the data linked to the code. From website and landing page links to phone numbers and email contact, you can integrate all sorts of information required to streamline your marketing efforts. Moreover, the  is low, so a business of any size can implement a QR code marketing strategy.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/marketing/6-ways-to-use-qr-codes-for-marketing.html"},

Then, we put it in an envelope and she mailed it to the North Pole.At the time, I thought my teacher had a connection with Santa Claus. She said so many nice things about him that she must have known him personally. Accordingly, I thought a letter delivered to him by my teacher would have credit.The other night the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I were sitting around drinking some hot cocoa and thinking about Christmas. She had just put up the Christmas tree with all of the decorations. She does such a wonderful job that I let her do it.Actually, one year I did try to help her and it was a catastrophe to say the least. Since then, I am to watch and fetch and that’s all. The Christmas decorations are wonderful and create a Christmasy spirit.As I was admiring the Christmas decorations, I happened to mention to her about the first grade letter to Santa. I casually said, “I guess Santa never got my letter.”Looking at me she said, “Why do you say that?”I chuckled and said, “I never got a pony for Christmas.”Together we laughed and then she said something that caused me to pause. “Do you want a pony for Christmas this year?”The way she looked at me when she asked that question, I thought she was being serious. It caused me a little bit of pause because what in the world would I do with a pony now.Then, I’m not one to let a situation go without playing it for all it’s worth.With a very serious look on my face, I said to her, “I sure would love to have a pony this year. It would make my Christmas just wonderful.”“Well,” she said rather sarcastically, “you’ll have to send a letter to me if you want that pony this year.”After a few moments of silence, we both broke out laughing.Where in the world would we put a pony in the Parsonage? What in the world, would I do with the pony in the Parsonage?Actually, I had not thought about that letter to Santa for a very long time. It is amazing what you do when you are young and then years later for some reason you remember it.Then in the middle of all of this pondering, my wife hit me with the question that I’m still not sure about.“Okay, what do you really want for Christmas this year?”I can think of many things. Pens, books and pocketknives to add to my collection. I can never have enough of these things. But, is that what I really want for Christmas this year?Pondering the question, I could not come up with a serious answer.To try to throw her off her guard, I said to her, “First, tell me what you would like for Christmas this year.”I thought she would give me a well-documented list of gifts that she would like for Christmas. She is so organized in everything she does I was pretty certain she was organized in this area as well.My problem in buying Christmas presents for her is that I don’t know what she would like. She has everything she wants and can use. I cannot buy her anything in the category of tools because that is an unknown territory for me.I have known this young lady when she was actually young and to this day, I would have a hard time getting a present for her that would actually surprise her. We have different likes and dislikes which makes us a very good team.“Oh, no,” she said abruptly. “You’re not getting away with that. Before I tell you what I want for Christmas you’re going to have to tell me what you want for Christmas.”If anybody knows how to back me into a corner, it is the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage. I have been backed into so many corners that there are none left in our house.I honestly did not know what to tell her. Then, much to my surprise, a wonderful thought began dancing in my cranium. It danced so much it made me think. I came up with a special Christmas gift for this year that I knew she could not contradict.“After giving this a lot of thought,” I said very soberly, “what I want for Christmas this year is another year to live with you.”Needless to say, she had nothing to say about that. Very few times do I get to say something that causes her to be silent.I was reminded of what the apostle Paul said. “That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death” (Philippians 3:10).The most important thing about the Christian life is not what God gives you, but rather that he gives you himself. Relationships are a great deal more important than possessions.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/humor/santa-claus-hasnt-received-my-letter-yet.html"},

As soon as I lay down my fork on Thanksgiving Day, the battle drums begin to roll. Somebody, who apparently does not have much of a life, takes a pot shot at the Christmas holiday. You would think, from some of their comments, the Christmas holiday was the greatest conspiracy in all of human history.According to these protesters, the very word 'Christmas,' offends them to no degree. They forbid people to say cheerfully, 'Merry Christmas,' as if those words in and of themselves would create the ultimate damage to the person hearing them.To placate these values-challenged patrons, some businesses have chosen not to put the word 'Christmas,' anywhere near their business, replacing that offensive word with the words, 'Happy Holiday.' Even employees are prohibited wishing customers a Merry Christmas, but rather a 'Happy Holiday.' This, according to the all-wise Christmas Grinch, is more acceptable than simply saying, 'Merry Christmas.'Of course, anybody who is as smart as a fifth-grader knows that the word “holiday,” according to Webster's dictionary, means, 'A religious feast day; a holy day.' So instead of saying 'Merry Christmas,' they want us to say, 'Have a happy holy feast day,' which seems more religious to me.I am thinking of starting a grassroots movement of people who are offended by people who are offended by the word 'Christmas.' The only problem with this, I would have a hard time finding people as nasty, venomous and as gray-matter-challenged as those offended by the word 'Christmas.' People who believe in Christmas and the Christmas spirit are rather good, loving and generous people.Part of our agenda would go something like this. People offended by the word 'Christmas' and by celebrating the Christmas season should not be allowed to take Christmas day off with pay. I do not hear any of these people complaining that they have Christmas day off with pay. If they really were offended by the Christmas season they would refuse taking any time off and getting paid for it.Along with this, all those objecting to Christmas would not be eligible for any kind of Christmas gift or Christmas bonus. All of these 'offensive goodies,' would go to those who love and appreciate the Christmas season.All government offices would be opened on Christmas day and staffed by all those people who find the Christmas season so very offensive. Why isn't the post office open on Christmas day? Moreover, why don't I get my Christmas Cards delivered to me on Christmas day?To further our agenda, all those offended by Christmas should not be permitted to shop at Christmas time to purchase 'Christmas gifts.' Nor should they accept any Christmas gifts. If they are honestly offended by the Christmas season this should be anathema to them.Any business person with a store should not have a Christmas sale. If they are really offended by Christmas, why do they insist on benefiting from those who delight in Christmas?While I am on the subject, why are all of these people who want to take God out of government, our school system and businesses still greedily accepting American dollars that have clearly printed on it, 'In God we trust.' If they were really true to their beliefs, they would never touch another American dollar in their life.This would be another part of our grassroots agenda. Those desiring to take God out of all of these things, if they are honest people, should surrender all their money to people who believe in God. After all, if you do not believe in God, why accept money that boasts in believing in God?Throughout the rest of the year, prayer in school offends these Grinches. This has always 'wondered me.' They do not believe in Christmas or God and yet when either is mentioned they go into a convulsive seizure as though their very life is being threatened.If I did not believe in something as radical as these people say they do not believe in God or Christmas, it would not threaten me. I might smile at people who believed in it, but it sure would not bother me and I would not be upset to the point where I would forbid others celebrating it. After all, I do not believe in Halloween, but I have not started a movement to ban it from our country. I think it rather silly for people to get all dressed up in scary costumes, pretending to be something they are not and begging for candy. As of today, I have not started a movement to ban them from running for political office.I allow those who do not believe in Christmas or in God to celebrate their holidays: Halloween and April 1. Just let me celebrate my holidays.I celebrate Christmas because of what the Bible says. 'But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father' (Galatians 4:4-6).Christmas means that God provided redemption for all humanity. Jesus is the real reason for the season.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/humor/behold-the-christmas-grinch-cometh.html"},

You should train your recruits about the products and business practices being adopted and should set aside some time and spend a minimum of at least a month with them.Explore Different Promotional ToolsIn order to achieve success in network marketing, you should learn about the different methods of promotion using various communication strategies along with direct selling such as social media and digital marketing, online marketing, and other communication tools to brush up on your skills and generate more leads.Find the Right Company and Market Your ProductFor network marketing success, you should choose to work with a respectable company and give back to your business by promoting the product almost on a daily basis. It can be anything; you can start a website, share product samples, start blogging and sharing videos, or even use the social media to create awareness about your product.Work HardYou won’t be able to succeed if you treat your MLM business as a hobby. The harder you work, the more opportunities you’ll have for income generation. You need to work on prospecting and presenting and should focus on following up and registering new people. Some time should always be allotted for training and support but your main focus should be on prospecting as this can be the key to your success.Be Persistent and Make New FriendsBuilding an MLM business can take up a lot of time which is spent in contacting a large number of people, delivering presentations and you may also come across a great deal of rejection. But only those who are persistent in duplicating a system will succeed.Success in network marketing will come by when you lend a helping hand to others so that they too can reach the heights of success.

There are plenty of bachelorette party favors youcan prepare to suit your guest’s tastes. But if you have no clueabout what to get them, here are some fun options you can choosefrom. 1. Candy – These are probably one ofthe most affordable party favors you can buy for your entourage. AndI’m sure they will be more than happy to accept a loot bag full ofchocolates and confectioneries for participating. You can stick tothe common retailed packages and sort them out. Or have aprofessional make you exclusive treats for the party, withheart-shaped pictures or statuettes of the bride and groom. 2. Naughty gifts and toys – It willcertainly excite the all-female party comers if they go home with abag of condoms, vibrators and underwear as party prizes. You couldtell them to postpone opening their care packages until they get homeso they’d be even more surprised with the contents. To make it morememorable, I suggest that you approach party specialists and have thebride and groom’s names or pictures printed on the packaging. 3. Tequila shot glasses or Champagneflutes – They are fancy souvenirs. And since bachelorette partieswill always have alcohol involved, they are more than appropriategiveaways for the event. It would make sense to commemorate the partywith customized drinking utensils since they are reusable. However,they might be a bit more expensive than the first three optionsmentioned. Regardless, they are worthwhile bachelorette party favorsto consider and would go great with a bottle of the appropriateliquor. 4. Spa certificates – What womanwouldn’t like to be pampered after a hectic bachelor party andwedding day schedule? I think everyone would be competing fiercely ifthey knew they would be getting manicure, pedicure and massages as areward.5. Gift packages. Fill up baskets withlotions, perfumes, towelettes and scented candles and give them awayas party freebies or prizes. To personalize the whole thing, you canplace a note card on there with the picture of the bride and groom,which guests can keep. Or again, have the labels replaced with thatof the bride and groom’s names. Of course, youhave to match the party favors with the motif of your bacheloretteparty as well as the guest list. It would be awkward to send outkinky items during a classy soiree to elderly family members who areattending. Now, regardless of what you go with, I believe it would bemore than a happy consolation for everyone to just be in the companyof friends and loved ones during this special occasion.

But in saying that, do not underestimate the power of custom web design when you are all set for the next step.Today, your customer is interacting with your business from the comfort of their home, through a mobile or a PC. Now, in order to attract them, extra efforts are to be made. In the beginning, when you are growing your brand, this might not be an issue, but as you see your brand growing consistently, it’s necessary to have a custom web design to grow your business.In this article, PixelPhant is up for sharing the need for a custom web design, and how it can impact your business towards positive gains.PixelPhant is among the most admired  for eCommerce. With professionals by our side, we have been helping eCommerce with their product image editing. Now with our blogs, we are inspired to share how to grow your eCommerce, generate more sales, and build your own brand. Branding is a crucial factor for any business, both online and offline. It makes the experience memorable and allows people to return as well as share a word with their respective friends and family.So what is the one thing that your customer will remember about your eCommerce? If it's the product, too bad cause they might appreciate the product but would not be able to recommend your specific website if they don’t remember it.A custom web design gives you a stand-alone chance to get in sync with your brand image and follow the same theme of color, font, style, logo, image, etc. to grow your business.Moreover, if you do it right, you can get a custom web design around your product. Not only will it motivate people to buy the product, but would also make it easy to remember and share your website with your product.If we weren’t just clear then here it is, loud and clear. You need to make yourself stand out. You might be giving the best customer service, highest quality, lowest price, or even all of them.But what if no one ever buys a product. Or if they do, but are not so frequent with the purchase as they should be. The reason can be they found you, a competitor just like you, and truthfully they won’t care from whom they are buying if the product is the same.A custom web design gives you a chance to stand out of the league and deliver your separate identity. In addition, if you can give your viewer something unique about your website, something that’s worth remembering, you can ensure that you have gained yourself a word of mouth marketing.This point isn’t just for the sake of reading but understanding. There might be millions of themes that are all set for you to run your website on. But every single one of them has that singular (or maybe more) factor that you wish you could change.Moreover, if you change it according to you, another issue starts popping up. On the other hand, a custom web design allows you to make every single piece of your website alter according to you.Be it the smallest icon to move on to the next page, or your homepage hero image that would bring in new customers. You can set up every single element according to your sales funnel, according to your copy, and according to the way you wish to present your products.A custom website design allows you to ensure that every single element of your website is according to you and can be updated whenever, and however, you want.A custom web design is built specifically on the way you perceive the future. Don’t get us wrong here, as you can always update the site according to you, but when a custom website design begins, the core aim is to ensure that your site is future-ready.The presentation, the , the on-site product promotion, product placement, checkout process, tracking, and more. All are centered around the goal to make sure that, even if 10x to 100x people come to your site, it is easy for you to manage them. While we were discussing the growth in traffic, the SEO of your website plays a very important role in it. SEO or search engine optimization of your website would decide whether or not your site would appear in the search result.As you might already know, it is the most important factor for any website to be SEO friendly as it would directly determine whether or not your eCommerce would be successfully sustainable.When working with custom web design, you can eliminate this worry as most web designers ensure that the website is SEO supportive first, and then work on the way it looks.While speed is part of a good SEO practice for a website, security turns out to be the most important factor. Especially if you are dealing with the customer’s data and privacy or if you are running an eCommerce store.Speed and security shall go hand-in-hand to make sure that none of the bulky protection eliminates the way your customer is interacting with your website. A custom web design ensures exactly the same and provides you with the most secure and quick website.At last, it burns down to the fact of how your website deals and interacts with your visitors. If it’s fairly ok, it won’t run for long. It needs to be exponentially good. And now it shouldn’t get you by surprise that a theme-based site might not deliver the same.On the other hand, a custom web design that is entirely based around the product and your customer persona can lift the bars and give your customer the best experience you plan for. From minimalistic to maximalism, you can choose what you want, where you want, and well how you want it. There is no doubt that a custom build website can enhance the customer experience to the fullest and get you to trust points from your customer more actively. You can learn more about How  to grow Online.Even though you might be satisfied by the theme-based site you are running right now and this is not an issue at all. But at the same time, the benefits of having a custom web design, can’t be overlooked.In the following article, as you saw there are about 7 core reasons to work on custom web designing for your site.

So, what is the domain name system and what is its use?The domain name system is the largest distributed network in the world. It is an internet service that helps to locate the domain names on the servers. When you type in a website name in the internet browser, the domain name system, or DNS, translates it into the corresponding IP address. This IP address is the internet protocol address. The domain name system looks for and finds the data required to establish the requested network connection.So,  every time a device connects to the internet - be it a smart phone, home or office computer or a web hosting server, it is issued with an internet protocol address which is unique to it. An IP address, basically, is a unique set of numbers that is assigned to a device that connects to the internet. This address can’t be used by any other device simultaneously and is used to recognize and differentiate the device by the servers among several others.The computer and other devices may be assigned a different IP address every time they log on to the internet. This is known as the dynamic internet address. Large organizations and web hosting servers usually opt for static IP addresses which do not change over time.So, typing in the website names in the address bar of the World Wide Web browsers is extremely easy and convenient than to remember the set of IP address numbers for every single one of them!! Without it, surfing the net would be very difficult. This makes the domain name systems important as it eliminates the need to remember all the IP addresses of the websites.The domain name system is spread over a million of networks but works as a single database. When the IP address of a website is not found on a server, it is transferred to the other name server and so forth to find the same. This process happens in the fractions of seconds to find the valid IP address of a corresponding website. Once all this is done, the web server fetches the requested page from the correct site and displays it. While all this sounds extremely complex to us, it is an easy job for the devices.The DNS system offers many benefits. By subscribing to a good DNS network, the clients can get high security, network stability and the uninterrupted performance. For a stable network, these systems need to be regularly redesigned and researched to meet the industry standards. The regular upgradation of these systems equips them to provide defense against the networking and security threats. A robust system offers the highest quality carrier facilities, better data transfer speeds, efficient interoperability, strategic connectivity and deliverability.So, domain name systems provide great benefits to small and big organizations alike.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/domain-names/what-is-a-dns-and-why-it-is-useful.html"},

For example, on table 1 you are on a table full of big stacks with 7-6 suited and call a raise from the cutoff whereas on table 2 you face a raise from the short stack and have to fold that same hand on the button.Top tip 1When holding top pair good kicker versus a short stack fish keep betting. Slow playing or trapping is fancy-play syndrome when playing against these opponents. We make money from our hands that go to showdown and therefore need to ensure we get as much money in as possible when holding a relatively strong hand.Top tip 2Against the professional short stackers you can steal their blinds a lot. When you min-raise and they have 40 big blinds it is too much to just shove. They are not comfortable playing postflop and will fold to our raises a lot of the time meaning we make auto profit.Top tip 3Have a plan. You should be expecting to face three-bets a lot of the time when you raise. Before you raise know which hands you are going to raise/call with and which hands you are going to raise/fold. This will mean you make sure you are not folding or calling too often.When playing against tight players it is usually pretty easy to assign them a range. If a nit calls you they will likely have a pair, Broadway cards or a suited Ace. Against the calling station it’s almost impossible to assign them a range because they are playing such a wide, creative, wild and ambitious range. For example, the cutoff opens, you three-bet the button and a calling station cold calls out of the big blind.

You may be passionate about putting your ideas into words but without proper groundwork, there is a possibility of failure. Here are some tips on how to prepare and write a successful non-fiction book.", "word-count": 522, "body": "“Writing is an exploration. You start from nothing and learn as you go”                                                                                          ~ E. L. Doctorow ~ Many avid writers who feel passionate about a specific story or topic can’t wait to put words on paper to tell the world about it. Same is the case when writing a non-fiction book. But since writing a non-fiction book is quite different as compared to writing novels and stories, novice writers often tend to make mistakes. That’s why in today’s article, we will share a few tips on how to prepare and write a fantastically successful non-fiction book. The Topic – Decide What You Will WriteThis may sound a bit cliché, but choosing the topic is the most important aspect of writing a non-fiction book. This is mainly because if you just start off writing a non-fiction book without any focus on a specific topic, you could end up with just about anything. Your dialogue may become repetitive or you might even end up with a whole different book than what you intended. Therefore, choose a topic you are interested in writing, and one that is also relevant to your target audience. This way, you will be able to provide focus for your book while maintaining the interest of your readers at the same time. Ensure There Is a Market for Your BookWhen choosing the topic or genre, ensure that there is a market for your book. This is mainly because a book without a reader is a lonely, pitiful object without value or purpose. By determining your market beforehand and writing to meet the market’s needs, you will ensure an audience of readers before you even start writing. A Content Plan – Create the ChaptersAs mentioned earlier, writing a non-fiction book is different than writing storybooks and novels. When writing a non-fiction book, you can’t come up with chapters while writing the content.  In fact, you need to create a content plan and make the chapters beforehand.  Once you’ve written out all of the chapters, write a paragraph or two below each chapter that elaborates on the key points.  The process is similar to creating an outline or a table of contents for your book; making it easier to discuss different topics and organize them accordingly. Ultimately, this will help you focus on your main topics/subjects and keep you from discussing other matters that don’t pertain to your book. Research – The Key to SuccessThere is no harm in writing a book “off the top of your head” if you’re an expert on the subject matter. But often, doing so can lead to writer’s block and therefore slow down the writing process. The process will flow a lot smoother if you research your topic and include all important ideas and points in the table of contents you have created. Then, simply use your researched facts as plug-ins to compliment the areas of expertise that you’ve written about. Last, but not the least, hire a professional editor to avoid any delays when releasing and marketing your book. By following these tips, you will successfully be able to prepare and write a non-fiction book.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/domain-names/preparing-to-write-a-non-fiction-book-a-few-tips.html"},

Your domain will be the main detail your audience will remember about you.Choosing the right top level domain is also important. Whether you’ve decided on a .com or something quirkier such as .design for your creative blog, there are many extensions to choose from for personalisation.Choosing your domain nameWhen choosing domain names, make sure that it’s highly relevant for your business. Brand or company names are the sensible choice.In the event that the name is already taken, you can opt for a  service or look for alternative options, such as a different and unique TLD other than the common .net or .com, or an entirely different name that’s still relevant to what you do. Simple and catchy should do it.You need to make the domain memorable for it to stick. Remember not to use dashes, numbers and abbreviated words. These things make it harder for people to remember the domain when typing it.If your business is centralised in one location, try to include the name of the place in your domain. Country designations such as .au or .asia are also ideal as they make the name more regionalised.How to register Once you’ve chosen your domain name, you can register it at a domain registrar and make it officially yours. Type in your domain at the website and see if it’s available.Different TLDs have their own requirements. Some don’t require anything more than your basic information, while others have certain restrictions. Country TLDs like .au also require that you have an address in the country as well as a registered business number.Make sure to check the requirements and see that you meet them appropriately. Once you’ve registered, you can choose add-ons such as privacy settings on your Whois listing and others.It is also a good idea to recheck that your domain name doesn’t infringe on an established company or brand. Many lawsuits occur in relation to this, especially when the new domain name registered is too similar and can be confused to an already existing business.Maintaining your domainDomains have expiry dates, often depending on how many years you registered it or the minimum or maximum time required. Either way, once the expiration looms closer, you need to renew within the required period before the date.Take note that expired domain names get pooled into available names and can then be registered by other people, especially the ones who may have purchased a backorder service. Avoid loss of domain ownership as this could mean losing your business.Keep these things in mind about  so that you’ll know what to do when it comes to getting your own.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/domain-names/top-tips-for-your-domain-name-registration.html"},

Surprisingly, you are wide awake while watching TV or playing games and even at bedtime you have to force yourself to sleep. However, while studying, it is when the sleepiness state hits you the most.", "word-count": 642, "body": "During the exam days, sleep becomes the toughest hurdle in your way to success. When you have to pull an all-nighter, all of your time is wasted in running the drowsiness away. According to research, 70% of the students feel drowsy due to insufficient sleep and 50% report feeling sleepy in the daytime. This eventually leads to bad grades and poor overall performance. For this, we have some experimented tips which will help you ditch sleep and keep your focus stiff.1.Light Up Your Study RoomAt times, the intensity of light in your room is so low that you automatically start to feel drowsy. Make sure that your study room is well lit and does not give a comfy vibe that makes you crawl into bed and have a good sleep.2.Have a Proper Study FurnitureOne of the biggest mistakes a student make is to use their bed for studying purpose. It is only for sleeping or relaxing your body when you are tired. Set up a proper table and chair because your position matters a lot when you have to sit for long hours to prepare your test. Try to move your hands or legs at regular intervals to ensure that your body is up and active.3.Avoid Heavy EatingWithout you knowing, your body becomes lazy when you have your stomach full. According to science, when you have heavy food, your body relaxes and in return you become lazy. Hence, it is advised to avoid heavy food before the day you have your next big exam.4. Keep Yourself HydratedWater does not only help you in being fit and active but also keeps you alert. This trick is proved to be the most successful one among the students as constant drinking causes you to make trips to the restroom. Due to this your mind and body never sleep.5.Early Sleeper, Early RiserEvery student should lead a disciplined life. If you want to achieve your goals you will have to set some proper principles you should live by. The topmost rule is to sleep early and rise early.

The song came that referred to Santa’s nice list and naughty list. I was not paying too much of attention, but somebody else in the room was.“Do you think you are on,” my wife said rather sarcastically, “Santa’s nice list or naughty list?”I always get trapped by such questions. I have been married long enough to know that questions are not posed to get an answer, but rather to get someone in trouble, mainly me.I did not want to answer that question and I didn’t know how to get away from it. Suddenly the answer came to me.The telephone rang and I jumped up to answer it. It was some Robo call trying to sell me something I did not want. I took advantage of the situation and carried on a one-way conversation, hoping someone would forget the question they had asked previously.Finally, I hung up the phone and resumed drinking my hot apple cider tea in the living room.Then it came back again. “Well, are you on the nice list or the naughty list?”This only points out the difference between us. Nice is really a matter of perspective. Some people think something is nice while other people think the same thing is naughty.For instance. My wife thinks eating too many apple fritters is very naughty. I think you cannot eat too many apple fritters and it is really nice to eat one. Or two. Or three, or four.I cannot see what naughty has to do with eating an apple fritter.If eating an apple fritter puts me on Santa’s naughty list, then I gladly apply for that position.My problem is, looking at Santa and the dimensions of his waist, I do not think he believes eating an apple fritter is naughty. I am not sure my wife considered that aspect.After all, everybody sets out cookies for Santa to eat when he brings the presents. What is the difference between a cookie and an apple fritter?I think my wife will be surprised when at the Marriage Supper of the Lamb in heaven there will be apple fritters for dessert.Then there is the idea of organizing your mess.According to the other resident in our home, organizing and cleaning up after yourself is nice. If you do not do that, it is naughty.I sure would like to know who set those rules. I think if your mess is comfortable and you are happy with it, it should be nice.If she thinks organizing her space is nice, then why can’t she allow me the same privilege to think that my messy space is also nice?It is all just a matter of perspective.Then it is Christmas time and people should be able to indulge in certain activities that at another time may be naughty.One of my holiday indulgences is eating.A bunch of us gathered to have a Christmas dinner before the actual Christmas holiday and we had a merry time. I was enjoying myself and indulging in the luxury of eating everything set before me.Someone was passing a pumpkin pie and asked if I wanted another piece of pie. I’ve already had three pieces of pie, but this is the time of the year to indulge. Before I could even process the word “yes,” my better half jumped in and said, “No, he’s had enough pie for tonight.”Her definition of “enough pie” is a little different from mine. My definition is, “Yes, I’ll take one more piece.” It does not matter how many pieces I have had up to that point, one more is always on my plate. That is what makes eating pie nice for me.The most disturbing part of that conversation was when she looked at me and said, “Remember, you’re on a diet!”Her idea of being on a diet is to watch what you eat. That’s nice in her regard.My idea of being on a diet is to watch what I put in my mouth. That’s nice in my regard.“So,” my wife said after a long pause, “are you on Santa’s nice list or naughty list?”“That all depends,” I said rather slowly, “on your definition of nice and naughty.”What I think is nice for me may not be nice for someone else. And what someone else thinks is naughty I may not consider to be naughty at all. It is all just a matter of perspective.Then a thought popped into my head.“Are you referring to Santa’s list or to your list?”For once, she had nothing to say. She just looked at me and could not come up with a comeback. Now that’s nice.I believe Paul had this in mind when he writes, “Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more”  (1 Thessalonians 4:1).The question needs to be restated; are we on God’s nice list or God’s naughty list?To please God in everything I do is the great ambition of my life. I know that I cannot please God and other people at the same time.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/humor/nice-is-a-matter-of-perspective.html"},

{"heading": "7 Most Important eBook Features that Publishers should integrate", "author": "Emily Watson", "description": "This article lists important features that an Ebook should have and enlightens publishers on the effective use of these modern features to optimize sales.", "word-count": 1074, "body": "According to a report published by , the Ebook market currently stands at $15,740 million and it is projected to grow at a rate of 4.2 percent annually in the year 2020-2024 to assume a market share of $18,533 million by 2024. We can attribute this radical growth to the use of diverse interactive features that modern Ebooks come equipped with and the level of interactions and engagement they generate. Needless to mention, traditional print media are no match to the modern Ebooks. Publishers have started using sophisticated technologies to create interactive and innovative Ebook features that would allow them to deliver pleasant experiences to the target audience. In this article, we have discussed about 7 most important features that beautify Ebooks and make them more appealing to readers. Books are judged by their covers. This is a plain, simple truth that publishers and self-published authors should take into account. Research indicates that a user takes not more than 50 milliseconds to develop a perception about your book in his/her subconscious mind based on its visual appearance. So if you are a publisher, you should ideally take less than 50 milliseconds to understand if the cover page design is relevant to the content and if it can grab the attention of the readers at first glance. The first impression creates the last impression and so you should make sure that you create a big impact in the first instance. Secondly, the title of the Ebook gives it its identity. So the title should be notable and people should be able to remember it easily. Choose titles that suggest actions and convey the meaning of your content with better clarity. You may also use numbers in the title. Numbers invite more attention compared to generalized titles. For example, “5 tips to streamline your supply chain operations” is more definite and attractive than “How to streamline your supply chain operations”. If you do not have in-house staff to design the cover page, you may consider hiring a professional company for  to handle this task on your behalf. Did you know that the authenticity of content can drive engagement and revenues in turn? You are more likely to keep your readers enthusiastic about your content if you provide content that is meaningful to them. Your content should be able to generate a feel of trust among your readers. You should base your content on extensive research and should support your claims with relevant stats and data. Make sure that you deliver content in reflowable formats; your readers should be allowed the liberty to access your content from any device. You will definitely not want to offend your readers due to readability issues that may result from your readers’ inability to adjust their reading styles on different devices and screens. When you add interactive elements, you would promote higher levels of user engagement. Use of interactive elements generates educational value and ensures the delivery of unique content experiences. Content that comes equipped with diverse multimedia features is more likely to stay in the readers’ minds for a long term.Your Ebook’s description should narrate why your content is important how it will impact the readers. The description should properly highlight why your readers should invest their time and money in your content. An appropriate description would generate interest among your readers and would boost sales. Your description should ideally bring forth the main ideas and the boldest claims that you are making. The description should highlight the current situation of your readers and let them know that you have a solution for their problem. With , you will be protecting yourself from revenue loss. When an Ebook gets shared, a publisher suffers from revenue loss because most people prefer sharing over buying. When you protect your content with DRM, you safeguard your work from piracy and loss of revenue. By having your work protected by DRM, you would ensure that your intellectual property brings you the profits that you deserve. You may consider using embedded links throughout your content to engage your readers at a broader level. This way, you can allow your readers to get access to comprehensive content and to let your readers know about your products and services. When you use external links in your content, you can show to your readers that your content is based on extensive research and hence, it is reliable.

Make sure that you identify the most reliable Ebook conversion services and select the best service provider based on your requirement and budget. Your Ebook should deliver excellent reading experiences to your readers. Consider putting across a detailed skeleton of your book to let your readers choose the sections that they would consider reading first.

{"heading": "Poor As I Am, All I Can Give Is Thanks", "author": "James L. Snyder", "description": "It was a pre-Thanksgiving evening and the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I were enjoying some hot cider tea. Nothing goes down quite as nice as a hot cider tea.", "word-count": 878, "body": "It was a pre-Thanksgiving evening and the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and I were enjoying some hot cider tea. Nothing goes down quite as nice as a hot cider tea. It was rather a quiet evening and I happened to glance over at my wife and saw her staring into space as it were. It concerned me because I knew that’s what she did when she was thinking about something.The problem that faced me was simply this. Was she thinking about me or something else? If it’s me, I’m probably in trouble. If it’s something else, I’m probably in trouble. No matter which side of the fence I’m on, I’m in trouble.I was tempted to ignore the situation and continue the silent evening but something inside me would not let me sit still. I don’t know what it is about us husbands, we don’t know when to shut up and we don’t know when to speak up. If only we could do the opposite of what we're thinking at the time, we probably could get along much better with the opposite side of the fence.“What are you,” I asked her quite simply, “thinking about so strongly?”Continuing to stare into space, she was silent for a few moments and then she said, “I’m trying to figure out what gifts we should get for our family.”Say what? I haven’t even demolished the Thanksgiving turkey yet and she’s thinking about Christmas gifts.That is the way with my wife. She cannot let a day go by without thinking of something three weeks or two months down the road. She cannot sit still and enjoy the moment.I, on the other side of the fence, am able to sit down and enjoy this silence of the moment. I do not have the jitters to get up and do something. I have the calm, relaxing feeling of just sitting and enjoying the moment.I knew what was going through her mind; all of the members of our family and what they like to get at Christmas time. On my part, I cannot come up with all the members of our family without asking questions to someone across the room. I recognize them when I see them, but I always forget one or two when I’m trying to think about the family.That is the difference between my wife and me. She can keep a list of the family in her head for months, yea even years and know exactly what they would like for Christmas and even for their birthday. I don’t even know their birthdays and have to be reminded by my wife.Here we were, just a few days away from Thanksgiving and the wife is thinking about Christmas.It seems to me that there is a reason why Thanksgiving comes before Christmas. Thanksgiving is a time that we give thanks sometimes for the turkey in front of us. Sometimes, for the turkey in the family, if you know what I mean.I said very cautiously to my wife, “Just relax and enjoy the evening and wait until after Thanksgiving to work on your Christmas list.”She came down out of her staring across the room and began staring at me one of those stares that I’ve experienced so many times in life. “I must,” she said most dramatically, “try to figure out what I’m going to get my family for Christmas.”I flashed a smile back at her and cuddled up to the silence for a few more moments.One thing I can say about her, she is very generous when it comes to giving, especially at Christmas time.As for me, my focus is on Thanksgiving. It’s coming up very shortly and when it does, I want to be ready to enjoy every bit of that Thanksgiving dinner. I know that around the table will be a variety of family members. I know that some of them will be very chatty about what’s going on in their life. I will smile and nod most generously, but my focus is on Tom the Turkey.As my muse took me a little bit further down memory lane, I began to see and appreciate the difference between Thanksgiving and Christmas. I know they are about a month apart, but there’s a bigger difference than days when it comes to Thanksgiving and Christmas.Christmas is when you spend a whole lot of money buying Christmas presents for everybody in your family even those that, well, how can I say it, is not on your nice list.Thanksgiving is quite different. Once I get beyond the turkey, I begin to realize that the purpose of Thanksgiving is simply to give thanks.Christmas costs a lot, especially out of my wallet, but Thanksgiving costs more but in a different currency.For Christmas, I have to work out a budget and I’m always, or should I say my wife is always over budget.However, Thanksgiving is different. Thanksgiving is giving thanks and that has no monetary value on it at all.Giving thanks is a good thing as David points out, “It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto thy name, O Most High” (Psalm 92:1).No matter how much coin I have in my pocket, giving thanks is the richest thing I could possibly give.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/humor/poor-as-i-am-all-i-can-give-is-thanks.html"},
{"heading": "A Bug on the Plate Is Worth How Much?", "author": "James L. Snyder", "description": "Did you ever have a smile on your face that no matter what you did you could not wipe it off?", "word-count": 875, "body": "Did you ever have a smile on your face that no matter what you did you could not wipe it off?Well, that is quite a regular occurrence with me. But this past week was a “smile-on-the-face” to beat all “smiles-on-the-face.” My only regret is that I did not do a Selfie.It all began in the morning when I suggested that we go out for lunch for a pre-Valentine’s Day celebration. Sometimes with our schedule we cannot celebrate a celebration on that celebration day.Of course, the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage responded in the positive.“You,” she said rather sarcastically, “will be picking up the check?”“It’s the least,” I said in response, “I can do for your Valentine’s Day present.”Smilingly she said, “It sure is the least thing you could do.”We chuckled simultaneously, which is something we rarely do, but this was a special occasion.As a culinary whiz, my wife has served me some of the most delightful meals on the globe. No question about it.So, going out for lunch at a nearby restaurant was a blessing to her, but not quite the blessing to me. Until this luncheon.The host of the restaurant took us to our table and we sat down to begin our luncheon activity. At this point, everything was going fine.The waitress took our order and we set back to relax waiting for our meal to arrive. We filled the time with chitchat of which my wife is an excellent chit-chatter. I, on the other hand, am a great chitchat listener. In this regard, we make an excellent team.The fun was just about to begin. If I knew how much fun was going to take place, I could have prepared myself a little better. But, you never know what’s going to take place. Within a few moments, the waitress brought our order.We both had hamburgers. I had fries with mine while she ordered a plate of vegetables.The thing I hate about going to a restaurant like this is that I have to pay for the vegetables. I know vegetables are good for you, but do I have to eat them all the time?We said our prayer over the food and then commenced eating. Looking back on the situation, I do not think my prayer was sufficient for the situation at hand.My wife always orders her hamburger medium-well. I like mine cooked all the way through. No pink allowed in my burger.As my wife cut her hamburger in two, that’s the way she likes to eat it, when all of a sudden red liquid leaked all over her plate.“Oh, my goodness,” she exclaimed, “what is this pink stuff?”I thought I knew what that pink stuff was, but I was not going to mention it in her presence. When she pulled both halves apart, both sides were red and oozing pink juice. I could tell immediately that the hamburger was not cooked all the way through. I could have mentioned it to her, but I know better than to jump in where I don’t belong.She called the waitress over and showed her that her hamburger was not cooked. The waitress immediately apologized, took the hamburger, went and got her another one and this time it was cooked all the way through just like she likes it.One calamity fixed. So we set back and began to enjoy the rest of our lunch together.I couldn’t help but snicker and she said, “And what are you snickering about?”Then we both began laughing together. There is no sense in trying to grouch your way through a situation like this. There was a problem, the problem was fixed, now we could enjoy lunch together.If I thought that was the end of our fun, I was to be surprised.I mentioned to her several times how her hamburger was, and she just looked at me and smiled and I had to smile right back at her. Usually, I’m the one that gets the bloody hamburger. I like mine well done and there are times when it is not well done. This time the joke was on her.We finished our hamburgers, I was eating my French fries and she was nibbling at her vegetables. I think a French fry is a vegetable, but I’m not going to contest it.Then I heard her scream, “What’s that?”Everybody in the restaurant heard her and was looking at me as though I was the culprit. When I got over her scream, I asked her what in the world was wrong.“Look at that,” she stated.I looked at her vegetables, which is something I don’t like to do, and then I saw it. It was one of those little things with legs that creep around. Yes, there was a bug in her vegetables.How do you keep from laughing at something like that?The waitress came and was duly upset and finally said, “I don’t know how that happened. Please forgive us; your lunch is on us.”Solomon had it right when he said, “He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the Lord, happy is he” (Proverbs 16:20).Sometimes God allows things to happen to see if we really have joy in our hearts. I must confess that at this luncheon I did have joy in my heart.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/humor/a-bug-on-the-plate-is-worth-how-much.html"},
{"heading": "Ha, Ha, I Knew I Was Right!", "author": "James L. Snyder", "description": "Did you ever experience a time when you were right and had the evidence to prove you were right?", "word-count": 877, "body": "Did you ever experience a time when you were right and had the evidence to prove you were right?I know that for me, it does not happen very often. In fact, I cannot think of a time that it really did happen to me. Well, until recently. I want to remember this incident as long as I live.The Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage was preparing for our Thanksgiving family get-together. It takes her weeks to get everything prepared; she is so meticulous and will not allow anything to go wrong from her point of view. Everything has to be done just so.Experience has taught me during this time of the year to stay out of the kitchen! That is why I am still living to this very day.However, it does have its advantages. I can relax in my “man cave” and stay out of her way. I know that if I ever get in her way she always, without exception, has a job for me to do. I like working, but not under those circumstances. If she cannot see me, she cannot give me work to do.One thing she is most focused on are vegetables. According to her, there has to be a balance of vegetables and the greener the better.I, on the other side of the “I Do” aisle, have very little patience for vegetables. I was losing the battle for this vegetables war until recently.I was haphazardly watching the news one night when they came out with a very scary bulletin. It seems that a certain vegetable (I will not name it because I am not a vegetable person and a vegetable to me is a vegetable) was infected and giving people E. coli.When I first heard that news, I thought I heard it wrong. After all, I have been told all my life that vegetables are good for you and will not harm you. A healthy diet includes lots of veggies. Then they come along with this warning that you should not buy this certain vegetable.“Hey, my dear,” I cheerfully said, “come and look at this news report.”I love modern technology because by the time she got into the room the television report was over. Very nonchalantly, I pressed the rewind button and was able to replay that news report about a certain vegetable.I was as quiet as long as I possibly could be, and then I blurted out, “See, I told you, vegetables are not all good.”She gave me one of “those looks” and walked back into the kitchen.I grew up in a farm community in Pennsylvania and one of the sayings my grandfather had was, “When you have a cow you need to milk it.” And I was about to milk this for everything I could.I grabbed my coffee cup and went out in the kitchen to get another fresh cup of coffee and when I was there, I happened to mention, “I always knew vegetables could be dangerous.”She looked at me and then said, “That is only one incident and I’m not sure it’s even true.”“If it’s on TV it has to be true,” I spurted very sarcastically.Then I had an idea burning in my head that I had been wanting to share with her for a long time but never had an opportunity. She is always getting on my case about my apple fritters, and how harmful they were to me. When saying that she was always staring at my fully developed stomach.“There has never been,” I began as seriously as possible, “any news report that apple fritters are harmful to your health. Certainly, not like this vegetable on the news today.”She looked at me and smiled, but as I walked away, I could see out of the corner of my eye she was sticking her tongue out at me. It feels so good to be right about something and have it collaborated by the “TV news media.”This is a novel experience for me to be certain. It might be the only one so I plan to enjoy it as long as possible. During the next few days whenever we crossed paths I always smiled victoriously at her.At our family Thanksgiving get together, I noticed that a certain “vegetable” was not on the table. You do not know how hard it was for me not to mention that. Every once in a while I would glance in my wife’s direction and smile. She knew what I was smiling about, but just let it go.I guess that is what married life is all about. Sharing secrets between one another.Every time I eat an apple fritter from now on, I am going to be smiling in remembrance of that “vegetable.” I am not that accustomed to victory and so I was taking advantage of it. However, I knew I had to be careful because sometimes things can backfire. I know this by experience.I was enjoying my victory at the time, and then I remembered what the apostle Paul said about victory. “But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ” (1 Corinthians 15:57).God has for us victory that supersedes any victory we could have in this world.

This year was one of those “once in a while’s.”It’s a pretty well known fact that the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage and myself differs when it comes to culinary likes and dislikes. How we got along for so many years is truly a miracle, I suppose.She, for example, loves vegetables, particularly broccoli. (Excuse me, I need to go and wash out my mouth.)On the other side of the table, I love Apple Fritters. (Excuse me, I need to relish the thought of an apple fritter.)Throughout the year, she tries tricking me into eating vegetables. I’ll take so much, but then I draw a line in the sand. That sand sometimes gets a little disheveled and I know who is disheveling it.I have tried to tell her that a good mother will make Apple Fritters for her family. She dismisses that and says quite emphatically, “No good mother will ever do anything of that nature. A good mother will make vegetables for their family.”And so the “discussion” goes on and on.We were watching the news as they were reporting on the funeral of the 41st President of the United States. Someone was giving some kind of a eulogy concerning that president and said something that caught my attention.According to this eulogy, the 41st President hated broccoli. Let me repeat that, he hated broccoli, as well as all other vegetables.I looked at my wife and said, “I’m in good company.”She just dismissed that and went on with her work in the kitchen. I grinned a lot and relished the moment. I just don’t get too many moments like that.Then, something wonderful happened.Christmas cards were coming from family members all over the place. I think people send an early Christmas card to make sure we will return a Christmas card. I was opening the Christmas cards and came to one that made my Christmas the delight that it has become.Some of my wife’s sisters were sending her throughout the year recipes from their mother in their mother’s own handwriting. I didn’t take much note to that because I’m not allowed in the kitchen to do any cooking.Very nonchalantly, I was opening these Christmas cards and then I came upon “the” Christmas card. I noticed it was from my wife’s sister and as I opened it, there was a little card inside that made my life a true joy.The sister was sending in her Christmas card one of their mother’s recipes written in their mother’s own hand. You will never guess what the recipe was in that card!When I opened it up, I could not believe my eyes. My eyes have fooled me quite a bit down through the years, but this time I had to rub them several times in order to believe what I was seeing.There in their mother’s own handwriting was her recipe for “Apple Fritters.” I had it in my wife’s mother’s own handwriting.You can hardly imagine my joy. There is no Christmas joy equal to the joy I felt looking at this recipe.Now, how was I going to present this to my wife and get all the benefit out of it?I put all the cards back together and laid this particular Christmas card on the top. I invited my wife to come and sit down and look at some of the Christmas cards that had come from the family.She sat on the couch and I gave her the Christmas cards and then returned to my chair to watch her opening up these Christmas cards. In the meantime, I had such a big grin on my face and I didn’t know how to hide it.As my wife is opening up the Christmas card, she looked up at me and said, “What in the world are you grinning about?”“I’m just having a happy Christmas season.”Then she opened the Christmas card containing her mother’s recipe it her own handwriting for “Apple Fritters.” She just stared at it for a few moments and then looked up at me with one of her classic stares.“What did you find?” I said as calmly as I could.“You know exactly what I found.” She was quiet for a few moments as she looked at that handwritten recipe from her mother.“So,” I said rather slowly, “when can we expect that recipe to be used in our kitchen?”She looked at me, then look back at the recipe card and spontaneously we both burst out into hilarious laughter.I don’t think I could have received a better Christmas present than that. Proof positive that good mothers do make Apple Fritters. Maybe there will be some changes in our kitchen.Thinking about that I was reminded of a Scripture in the Old Testament. “But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the Lord: and be sure your sin will find you out” (Numbers 32:23).No matter what it is, it will always be exposed in the end.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/humor/be-sure-your-grin-will-find-you-out.html"},

I want to take that a step further and say confession is good for the body as well.", "word-count": 879, "body": "I have heard it said that confession is good for the soul. I want to take that a step further and say confession is good for the body as well.I don’t often think about how old I am, I’m too busy with other thoughts. Occasionally, something happens that reminds me I am not quite as old as I think I am. Do not get me wrong, it is a good experience for soul and body.When I get up in the morning, I feel achy, not to mention grouchy because the Gracious Mistress of the Parsonage mentions that. I get up feeling old and dreary. I wallow in despair, thinking how old I really am and not knowing what to do with it.Oh, poor me, woe is me.Something happened this past week that gave me a completely different view of how old I really am.I had an appointment to go to the doctor to have my annual blood work done. Every year this doctor wants a sample of my blood for who knows why. He is obsessed with my blood and tries to get it every time he can. Being the good patient I am, I concede to his request.I had an appointment across town to get the blood work done and got there well before my appointment. Therefore, I had to sit in the waiting room until my appointment time.I usually take a book with me to read because I know that doctors, as educated as they are, do not seem to know how to tell time. So, instead of wasting that time, I take a book and get caught up on some reading I have to do. You cannot read too many books.While I was quietly reading my book, all of a sudden, I heard a bang and the door flew open and in came a woman with a walker. I will not say she was an old woman, but youth was in her past as far back as you possibly could go.When she came in, the whole atmosphere of that room changed and not in the positive. As soon as her head got through the door, you could see a grimace on her face to beat all grimaces. It scared me at first. I have never seen such a mean looking face.Then she begins snarling. “Get out of my way. Where’s my doctor? I want to see him now.”I was not in her way, but I certainly got further from her way as I possibly could. I am not sure how old she was but she had grouchy down to a fine-tuned art. I think all of us in the room were praying that the doctor would take her in right away.Thankfully, our prayers were answered. She was escorted out and you could hear a deep sigh in that room. I do not think I would have wanted to be her doctor that day, at least.I was finally settling down and back to my book when the door opened again. In walked an older gentleman, and I use the word gentleman very carefully, with a cane.He rumbled up to the window to sign in and the lady politely asked who he was.Looking at her with eyes that would have scared a tiger he said, “Who do you think I am?”That is not all he said, but some words I would not want to repeat even in the dark. Obviously, he was old enough to know all the curse words in the dictionary. He mentioned some words that I had never heard before and I am quite sure they are not in the English dictionary.He signed his name and then hobbled over to take a seat and then glanced at me and said, “What are you staring at?” Again, I cannot use all the words he used.Believe me, when I say I was tempted to tell him what I was looking at. Then I noticed the cane in his right hand and decided to look the other way.Until the nurse came to take him in to see the doctor, he was muttering under his breath and I did not want to hear what he was muttering. The meanness on his face gave me pause to think a little bit.Casually, I looked around the room and saw most of the people were old and nobody looked very happy. When they walked up to sign in, they limped. When the nurse got him to take them back to see their doctor, they staggered and limped.At the time, I did not know what to do. Then a smile began creeping across my face. I had to be careful that I did not laugh aloud. A wonderful thought danced in my mind.Looking around very carefully I noticed one stunning fact. That fact was, I am not as old as I thought I was. When I got up that morning, I felt old and decrepit. Now I was around people that were really old. Compared to them, I was a babe in swaddling clothes.I then remembered what David said. “They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing” (Psalm 92:14).I am at the place now where I can begin to enjoy the fruit of my old age.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/humor/i-didnt-know-how-young-i-really-was.html"},

That's probably why these weird college classes have emerged over the years. Keep reading for info on 5 of the strangest ones we found.", "word-count": 761, "body": "College can be a strange place. It’s where hundreds or thousands of the brightest young minds come together with various interests, skills, and pop culture all rolled into an academic institution. That being said, it’s no wonder that very interesting and diverse class options emerge in these places of innovation and thought.But we aren’t just referring to the more standard interesting classes. We’re thinking of those classes you read in the course catalog and think, “how is that even a class?”We’ve scoured the Internet for the best of the weird college classes that are being offered right now at some of the most prestigious educational institutions in the country. Class has begun!1. Newborn Parenting ClassesBetween a full course load, internships, part-time jobs, clubs, hobbies, and socializing, it’s hard to imagine throwing a newborn baby into the mix as well. But some people do go to college with newborns, infants, and children on the hip.Perhaps it’s for these student-parents that  arose at many colleges across the country. These  often teach the basics of parenting: developmental milestones to watch for, how to hold the baby, how to feed the baby, how to change diapers, etc. For example,  offered by the Oregon Health &amp; Science University teaches parents and other interested parties about childbirth, labor and delivery, breastfeeding, infant safety, and more.  from Bellingham Technical College focuses on childbirth as well as bringing baby home and other parenting tips.Infant classes like these are also common for nurses, midwives, teachers, day care workers doulas, and other medical professionals involved in childbirth or early childhood education. 2. Elvish 101Many colleges have a foreign language requirement. If you’re not interested in the many “real” languages out in the world, why not try one from a fantasy realm? Elvish is the language invented by J.R.R Tolkein for his series The Lord of the Rings. The language is so well developed that it’s actually taught as a foreign language at quite a few schools. You can learn to read, write, and speak elvish at a few different universities.The college that made this famous, though, is the University of Wisconsin, Madison where the famous Tolkien scholar and linguist named  taught a course. It’s no longer taught, but the legacy of such a weird college class lives on.3. The Science of Harry PotterSpeaking of classes based on fantasy worlds, there are many, many classes related to one of the biggest franchises of all time: Harry Potter. The is a course offered by Frostburg State University in Maryland. In this class, scientist Professor Plitnik examines the connection between science and magic seen in the series. This includes looking at the physics of spells and flying broomsticks, postulating the potential genetics of magic animals and people, and more.While this might seem silly, it’s actually an excellent way to learn scientific concepts. It relates the complex concepts of biology, chemistry, and physics to something that students love and understand. This is also a great way to break your mind out of the traditional academic science box to allow STEM students to be a bit more creative than they might normally get to be.4. Introduction to Pet ApparelWe’ve all seen silly dog costumes and clothes. But not all of us have thought of the fact that someone out there has to design these clothes. And some of these pet garments are designer in quality and price. This coat, for example, goes for anywhere  (depending on the size)! there’s big bucks in pet apparel! If you’re dying to get into the pet clothing industry, then you have to take  at the famous Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City. In this class, you’ll learn about the most popular pet forms and body needs, especially those for cats and dogs. You’ll also get a seasonal fabric guide, create garment sketches, craft mood boards, and more to create t-shirts, dog coats, and designer options. You’ll also learn how to make shoes, leashes, collars, and more with animal safe products and materials.5. UFOs in American SocietyFiled alongside other American history and American studies courses at Temple University in Philadelphia offers a course called “UFOs in American Society.” They give the following :“American society’s reaction to the UFO phenomenon. Analyzes UFOs and the controversy that has surrounded them by studying the attitudes of various groups toward the phenomenon, including the military, the scientific community, the national UFO organizations, the lunatic fringe, cult groups, charlatans, the entertainment industry, and the press.”All this class needs now is a field trip to  and you’ve got the most amazing offering in college today.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/humor/5-weird-college-classes-you-didnt-know-existed.html"},

{"heading": "Who is Gauranter of Honesty", "author": "Arun7291", "description": "In this story you are going to know :-", "word-count": 1025, "body": "Ram Sahai lived with his family in a small village in Rajasthan. Apart from a son Ghanshyam, 2 daughters and a wife, no one else was in his family.The father would work hard in his field day and night to harvest the crop, and when cooked, would take it to the market and sell it. This was the income of his entire family. There was no other means of earning in a village located far away from the city.One year when the crop was ready to ripen, it rained heavily and the entire crop was destroyed. Seeing the destruction of their crops due to heavy rains, both father and son were in tears. Could not do anything. Far from repaying the loan taken from Mahajan for farming, this year, he was also seen to be eating food at home.For a few days, lentils and rotis went on, but one day it came that there was nothing left to cook at home. Then, after being helpless, Ram Sahai said to his son Ghanshyam, 'Son, there is no earning here, and Mahajan's debt is also standing on the head. Why don't you go to the city and look for some work. ' Ghanshyam also readily agreed, seeing the financial constraints of the house.After two to three days, Ghanshyam left his village and family and went towards Jaipur. After reaching there, he started searching for a job in the evening. But wherever he goes, everyone asks him to bring a surety with him. Where did the bailee bring him, he did not even know anyone in this city.Three days passed and he did not get a job nor bail. The money he brought home was also about to end. Now he decided that he would only eat food for one time so that the money could run for a few more days, perhaps by then a job would be handed over.Even after a full 7 days had passed, Ghanshyam broke down when no job was arranged. But the question was that what would happen even after returning to the village. What is the means of earning there, only the debtor is standing. Put the hand in the pocket, the last 50 rupee note was left. Seeing this, he had tears in his eyes.It was 4 o'clock in the morning and he had not eaten anything since yesterday. Even how to eat, the money was almost full. Then an idea came up that why not go to some temple, maybe someone came to distribute food there.When he reached the temple, he also got in line to see a couple distributing food. When he got food, he sat on the stairs of the temple with a plate of food. Then a Seth came out of the temple with a plate of worship in his hand. His foot slipped while descending the stairs and he fell down. The people ran away and picked him up and placed the plate in his hand. Lord's Venus did not hurt much. Seth left in his car.Just then, while eating food, Ghanshyam looked at a purse on the stairs. When he picked it up, only notes were filled in it. He understood that this purse may not belong to the Seth who had just fallen. But Seth ji had already left. When Ghanshyam looked at the purse carefully, there was a card inside which the address of a shop in Johri market was written. The food was already eaten, so Ghanshyam started towards Johri market.When I reached that address, I saw that the shop was closed. Asked people nearby, it was found that this shop would open only around 12 o'clock. Now there was no option but to wait till 12 o'clock, and which job he had to reach. Kept wandering around and reached the shop at exactly 12 o'clock.Seeing the shop open, went inside and saw Sethji in the morning and breathed a sigh of relief. Go to him and put his purse on his desk. Seth ji was very happy after getting his purse. He told that when he came to know that his purse had fallen somewhere, he again went to the temple, but he did not find the purse there. Then Ghanshyam said, 'Sethi ji, when you were sitting in the car after falling, I had my eye on this purse. It was good that you got your card in it and I was able to reach here. 'Then Seth ji asked him, 'Didn't you think that you keep the purse after seeing so many money in your mind.' So Ghanshyam replied 'Seth ji, I am the son of a farmer and the father has taught honesty all his life.' Just as our crop is God dependent, so is our life. We have never learned to earn money by fraud or dishonesty. 'Seth ji was very happy with this answer. He wants to give her a reward of 1000 rupees, but Ghanshyam refuses to take him as his duty to return the purse. Then Sethji placed his hand on Ghanshyam's head and blessed him, 'Son, come back without hesitation whenever you need anything.'Ghanshyam was about to bow down to him that Seth Ji asked him 'Where do you live son?''On the road or under the bridge.' Hearing this answer, Seth Ji was shocked.'And what do you do?' There was so much to hear that Ghanshyam had tears in his eyes. Crying, he told Seth ji how no one gives him a job when there is no surety. He has been looking for a job in Jaipur for the last 7 days.So much had to be heard that Seth ji immediately said, 'You are your own surety. However, if anyone ever asks, I am sure to tell you. ' And then Seth Joe put him on a good watch at his shop. Also made a living arrangement.Seen how everyone respects honesty.Do not think of fruit while doing good workYou will find it yourself in some form or the other.Seen how everyone respects honesty.Do not think of fruit while doing good workYou will find it yourself in some form or the other.Must Read:-", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/humor/who-is-gauranter-of-honesty.html"},

I am a Emperor That's why intelligent people live around us. I am bored of living among intelligent people. So now I want to meet some stupid people.Birbal, however many challenges we have given you till date, you have met all the challenges. Can you find six stupid people for us? How heartfelt it would be to meet those foolish people.Birbal - Why are there no shelter? I will definitely find it.Akbar - We give you a month's time to find six fools.Birbal - where I don't think I would need so much time.Akbar - Ok Birbal, if you want to find it before you.What was it then, Birbal takes his horse and goes out in search of foolish people and kept thinking all the way where I will find those foolish people. Suddenly a man was sitting on a donkey and tied a buffalo on his head. Birbal stops his horse upon seeing him and asks him for his identity.Birbal - Who are you and why has this gash been placed on your head, why have you not placed it above the donkey.Ramu - My name is Ramu and I put this punch on my head because my ass was very tired and I thought I should take some weight on myself.Birbal thought I found my first fool -Birbal - OK, good! We will reward you for thinking so much about animals, let's go with us.Ramu - Ok, I will get reward.Then Birbal walks a little further away, while walking, he is seen fighting two men.

Where is Changu, where is your lion and Mangu is your cow?Changu - If God gives us a boon, I will ask for a cow and he is talking about asking for a lion, and is saying that he will leave his lion on my cow.Birbal - Ok, this is the case, both of you, come with me, I will reward you with the emperor for thinking so well about God.Changu-mangu - Inam, we will surely go.Birbal takes all three of them to his house, taking them home and then Birbal thinks, Now where do I find the fools of Walkie. Then Birbal walks out of his house at the same time and asks those three fools to stay at home.When he (Birbal) walks out of the house, he is seen a man looking for something in the beds. Birbal goes to them and says -Birbal - are you looking for something, can I help you?Man - my ring has fallen, I've been looking for a long time, but can't find it.Birbal - Where did your ring fall?Man - My ring had fallen under that tree, it has become dark there, so I thought I should find it here.Birbal - O, good, good! Then you go with us to the Emperor tomorrow, we will get you another ring. You leave that ring.Man - OK, then it's okay.Then the next day Birbal takes all four of them to Emperor Akbar.Birbal - Emperor, these are your fools.Akbar - You could do this work in one day, are there many foolish people in our Sultanate. And how are you sure these four are fools.Birbal narrates the events that took place on the way to Akbar. Akbar is very smug about Birbal.Akbar - But these are just four fools, where are the other two.Birbal - where two fools hideout are present here.Akbar - Here and where, tell us who they are.Birbal - I am one of them, who is the biggest fool.Akbar - Are you, how are you?Birbal - I am because I brought these fools.Akbar - (laughs) Ha-ha!

One won and lost the other. The armies returned to their cities. Just then, an army drum was left behind. Bhand and Baran, who played the drum with the army, used to tell stories of valor at night.After the war, a thunderstorm occurred. In the thrust of the storm, the drum was falling and aging and got stuck near a dry tree. The dry twigs of that tree were soaked with the drum in such a way that the strong wind hit the drum and there was the resonant sound of the drum.A jackal used to roam that area. He heard the sound of drums. He was very scared. He had not heard any animal before uttering such a strange voice. He began to think what kind of animal is this, who speaks such a loud speech 'Dhammadham'. The jackal would hide and look at the drum, to know whether this creature is about to fly or to run on four legs.One day, he was hiding behind a jackal and kept an eye on the drum. Then a squirrel descending from the tree jumped and landed on the drum. There was also the sound of lightning. The squirrel kept munching while sitting on the drum.Jackal babbed 'Oh! So these are not violent creatures. I should not be afraid either.The jackal blew up and went near the drum. Sniffed him. He did not see the head of the drum nor his feet. Then the twigs of the air collided with the drum. Dham sounded and the jackal jumped up and fell back.'Now understood.' He said while trying to fly the jackal, 'This is an outer shell. Creatures are inside this shell. The voice is telling that whatever organism lives within this shell, it should be thick and fresh. Body full of fat Only then does he speak the loud dialect of dham = dham.'As soon as he entered his den, Jackal said, 'Oh jackal! Get ready for dinner. I have come to find a big-time hunt. 'Siari started asking 'Why didn't you bring him to death?'The jackal gave him a shrug 'Because I am not a fool like you. He is hidden inside a shell. The shell is such that it has dry skin doors on two sides. If I tried to hold my hand from one side, it would not run away from the other door?Both went towards the drum when the moon came out. While he was approaching, the wind then hit the twigs on the drum and the sound of drumming came out. Sayar said in Siari's ear 'Heard his voice? Just think, whose voice is so deep, it will be so fresh.Straighten both the drum and sit on either side of it and tear the edge of both the skinned parts of the drum with the teeth attached. As soon as the foreskin began to bite, the jackal said, 'Be smart. Putting your hands inside together is to catch the victim. Both of them put their hands inside the drum with the sound of 'Hoon' and began to grope inside. There was nothing else. Each other's hands got caught. Both are shouted '! There is nothing here.

However, the fact of the matter is that come December 25th, the film will officially become the first-ever movie to get a 4K streaming option on HBO Max.Source:Now, given that you are a rich guy or someone with a home theater, you will be able to watch the film with an additional quality, which will be boosted by the HDR 10, Dolby Atmos, and Dolby Vision option, which will also be made available by HBO Max.Patty Jenkins herself has confirmed this via a tweet.She wrote on Twitter that she is pretty upbeat to share the news that Wonder Woman 1984 will be the first-ever featurette on HBO Max to get a streaming option in 4K Ultra HD, Dolby Atmos, and Dolby Vision. She added that she is eager for the audience to finally see her work.Jenkins remarked that the film would arrive on Christmas Day both in the theaters and on HBO Max’s OTT platform (only for the audience present in the United States). She advised all the cinephiles to buy the biggest TV screen they can possibly find.The devices that have been given permission to stream the upcoming tentpole are Apple TV 4K, Amazon Fire TV Cube, Amazon Fire Stick 4K, 4K Fire TV Edition smart TVs, AT&amp;T TV, Chromecast Ultra, and few Android TV devices as well.The stellar names that are missing from the list are Microsoft Xbox One and PlayStation 4. There is a reason for it. Although HBO Max is present in the consoles, they do not support 4K videos. However, Warner Media has promised that gaming consoles will get that additional technology in the models that will be released in 2021.Another thing you need to be aware of is that HBO has planned to introduce more movies in 4K format in 2021. It is positive news since the platform has severely lacked in that domain and is way behind its competitors. The content that is available on HBO Max does not get streamed in the format beyond 1080p, while its competitors such as Netflix have made the 4K available on their platform for many years.Wonder Woman 1984 is one such tentpole that has truly suffered from a series of delays. The movie was ready for the theatrical release last year itself. However, due to clashes with some other tentpoles, and then due to the pandemic, the movie had to be pushed back. It has now ultimately found a spot on the Christmas Day of 2020 (pushing “Dune” to October 2021).The movie was never meant to be released on OTT platforms so soon; however, due to the non-functioning of theaters in some areas of the United States, Warner Bros. had altered its plans a little bit.Wonder Woman 1984, starring Gal Gadot, will be the first movie in the DCEU timeline after the release of the 2019 film Shazam.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/internet/hbo-max-will-stream-wonder-woman-1984-in-the-4k-format.html"},

But, the life doesn’t stop there and neither does the responsibility. After the death of the loved one, the nearest relative or the legal heir needs to take charge of the assets and undertake the necessary procedure.Probate is a legal procedure in which the will of a deceased person is proven to be legal and is carried out. In case of absence of a will, the laws of the land become applicable and disposal is done accordingly.In California, the laws relating to probate are based on a number of factors like the value of the wealth, type of assets or property, loans and mortgages, etc. Let us have a look at some of them in brief, so that you can get some idea about ‘’.Place of DomicileIf the decedent has died without a will in effect of part or full wealth, then the laws governing the place of residence will be applicable, if all the wealth is at the same location. If the wealth is distributed over more than one location then the laws of these different will apply. To carry out the probate properly, you need first gather information about the location of the decedent’s residence and his/her assets.Different Parties to a ProbateIf the decedent hasn’t named anyone as an executor, the probate court holds the right to appoint one. On the other hand, if the executor has been named but is felt to be incompetent by the beneficiaries, he/she can be removed. Additionally, an executor and administrator can be two different people. So you need to get information about who is or can be the executor and administrator and make sure that both are competent enough.Value of the PropertiesIf the property of the decedent is categorized as having ‘small value’ then different provisions of Probate Code will be applicable. This is also decided according to the type of property, i.e. real property, personal property, etc. Hence, you need to gather information as much information about the properties of the decedent as possible.Mortgages and other duesAs per the Probate Code, from the wealth of the decedent, all the mortgages and dues must be paid off before distribution. If any wealth is left after this disbursement, if there is any fund left, then it is distributed among the heir as per the decision of the court. Thus, to carry out the probate as per the provisions of the law, you need to first find out about all the major and minor dues and then pay them off in the best possible manner. In case of certain mortgages, it may be possible that the beneficiary is ready to take over certain asset along with the mortgage.Apart from the above, there are a lot of other provisions which need to be taken care of while carrying out a probate.

And when you default or your check bounces the bank or company will try and contact you for the payment of the EMI. If the cheque amount is less than Dh200,000, the punishment may be by fine and the fine may vary between Dh2,000 and Dh10,000 depending on the cheque amount but if it's less than that amount then you can even pay you're fine online without having to visit a police station or court. However, paying the fine does not completely absolve the debtor of the responsibility, the complainant, in this case, the person who received the cheque can still file a case with the court. The criminal court may convict the issuer and give him or her two options – pay the money or go to jail.

Only the partner who has his or her signature on the cheque will be liable or the manager of the company, if the cheque bears his signature. Other people’s private funds have no bearing on the value of the cheque.

Before we can answer these pressing questions, let's back up a bit and discuss exactly what happened and who is going to help you. Economic charges are relatively common. After all, while few people in our society are okay with murder, far more are willing to switch the pricetags to make an expensive item less costly or skim a bit extra from their employer. Economic crime charges can be theft, fraud, credit card or access device fraud, shoplifting, purse snatching, possession of stolen property, worthless checks or check kiting, forgery, or bribery.

This is the first thing your criminal lawyers in Covington will look at. You want to avoid a felony at all costs. Could your lawyers get part of the evidence thrown out so you're looking at less value that was stolen? Can you plead guilty to a misdemeanor instead of taking your chances looking at a felony charge? Information can be traded for leniency. If you're part of a bigger criminal network, like a group putting skimmers on gas pumps to steal credit card information, flipping on the brains of the organization will help you substantially. Your criminal lawyers in Covington, LA will go through the preliminary examination, and consider a Motion to Suppress, Lunacy Hearing, and other Motions hearings. They'll do everything at their disposal to get you the best outcome possible. Exhibits must be viewed, witnesses interviewed, lab test results reviewed, and all photographs, videos, and recordings will be turned over to your team. You can all decide where to go from there. Your trial will be with a judge if it’s a misdemeanor. For a felony, there is the option of a jury. If you're facing a felony, you may think a jury will be sympathetic to your situation. These are the kinds of options you'll discuss with your legal team. This situation is very serious.

On 24 October 2020, the UAE Cabinet announced its decision to amend Federal Law No. 9 of 2016 (the “Bankruptcy Law”) by adding certain provisions covering emergency situations, including pandemics and natural disasters as businesses around the world are facing new and acute challenges in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.", "word-count": 406, "body": "The amendments outlined by  are also aimed at ensuring fulfillment of obligations, and mitigating loss given default without prejudice to bankruptcy law while enabling creditors to secure their rights.More about the amendmentsThis was to enable individuals and businesses to overcome credit challenges in “emergency situations. Initially when the Bankruptcy law has introduced the test to establish a debtor’s bankruptcy was rather clinical and impersonal but the amendments introduced have changed the way a debtor’s default is analysed completely. Now, one’s situation and surroundings are also taken into account.The new amendments stipulate that the debtor shall be exempted from commencing procedures to declare bankruptcy. The courts are also to provide a generous grace period of a year to negotiate mutual terms with their creditors. The Court is, however, not permitted to extend any time periods, including the grace period, by more than double the time a debtor would be given under normal circumstances.sThe court will not include the funds needed to keep the business afloat into the proceedings, keeping in mind the very testing times the debtor would already be facing. This includes fixing seals on a debtor’s business premises or its properties. This gives distressed debtors protection from formal bankruptcy proceedings and breathing space to continue operating. However, secured creditors remain entitled to apply to the Court for an order permitting them to enforce security against the debtor. Whilst creditors holding a debt of more than AED 100,000 can still apply to the Court to start bankruptcy proceedings against a debtor who has failed to settle a demand for payment within 30 days, the creditor’s application will not be considered by the Court until the end of the Emergency financial crisis. Dealing with all this the court will consider whether or not the debtor’s default is caused by the Emergency financial crisis. It remains to be seen if and when the UAE Cabinet will determine that there is an Emergency Financial Crisis and how the new measures will operate in practice.End noteIt is a welcome development for the UAE’s insolvency regime. The success of the new regime will depend ultimately on how effectively it is used in practice. These changes to the UAE Bankruptcy Law may have provided an alternative route to what previously would have been perceived as imminent bankruptcy.

By revising the Penal Code and Criminal Procedural law, the UAE government has cancelled the provision that gives a diminished or indulgent condemnation in what is called “honour wrong doings”. Under the ancestral custom, ladies are severely attacked and even murdered, by the family members for promiscuity, extra-marital affairs or for disobeying the religious and cultural mores. In such instances, the male members of the woman’s family generally escape punishment or get a lighter sentence under the guise of “protecting a woman’s honour”. Under the new reform, men will be awarded the same punishment for any kind of assault.Alcohol consumptionBefore this relaxation no man or woman was allowed to consume, buy, sell or transport alcohol without procuring a license even if above or of the legal age. This advancement awards Muslim men who were barred from alcohol consumption will enjoy this right from now on. However, the minimum age for alcohol consumption stands at 21, and selling to underage persons will remain an offence. Also, alcohol will only be allowed to be consumed privately or in licensed public areas.SuicideAttempted suicide, forbidden in Islamic law, is also said to have been decriminalised. The person would be ensured mental-health support by the police or the court. Earlier, a person who survived the suicide would be prosecuted. Abetment to suicide or providing assistance to take another person’s life will face jail.In a Nutshell!In a country where expatriates outnumber citizens nearly nine to one, the amendments will permit foreigners to avoid Islamic Shariah courts on issues like marriage, divorce and inheritance. The amendments to the Personal Status and the Civil Transactions laws will also allow non-citizens to choose the law relating to issues such as inheritance. The broadening of personal freedoms reflects the changing profile of a country that has sought to bill itself as a Westernised destination for tourists, fortune-seekers and businesses despite its Islamic legal code. The master stroke of a move follows a historic US-brokered deal to normalise relations between the UAE and Israel, which is expected to bring an influx of Israeli tourists and investment. The recent amendments issued by the government of UAE is a major step for all those residing in UAE and facing such challenges such cohabitation and consumption of alcohol.

In this article, we focus on IP lawsuits, instances of infringements, and counterfeit in the GCC countries that occurred over the last couple of years.In the GCC, there is no single court system with regard to patent litigation.Earlier this year, Qatar Airways, which is the second-largest airline in the Middle East got into an  owing to a breach of music copyright that is a part of the collection on its in-flight entertainment system.

The most number of items that were a part of this seizure belonged to the cosmetics category and was worth more than Dh 90 million. In the same year, it was also discovered that a large number of fragrances that are sold in smaller stores are fake and hence are being sold at ridiculously low prices. Not only is it a poor imitation of a brand, but it was also found to contain hazardous chemicals and antifreeze substitutes that cause rashes, skin allergies, and inflammation. When customers pick up these products and perform a quick assessment, the presence of a barcode tends to make them believe that it is original. However, replicating a barcode is not in any way harder than imitating the look and packaging of the actual product.Another alleged scam that recently came to light was in Oman where the authorities found that a popular e-commerce store that had a shopper base of more than 68,000 people had been selling counterfeit electronic gadgets.

The death of a loved one from the family can often open up legal issues in terms of who will inherit the deceased’s belongings and in what proportion. There have been multiple cases all over the world, fighting over the ownership of the deceased’s belongings. Such cases arise when there’s no clear indication, like a will, that clearly identifies who will inherit the belongings. For people living in foreign countries, it is essential to understand the legalities of the host country and their effect on your controlling assets, and finally to be able to hand it over to your loved ones without legal complications.The difference in the laws can actually affect how the belongings are divided amongst your family members.Non-Muslim expatriates:Expatriates make up for a major chunk of the population in UAE. With around 80% of the population being ex-pats, there are many people who invest in the country through property purchase and other assets. To be able to protect their own interests it is essential that they understand the cultural, legal and other social differences in the UAE. The differences:UAE follows the Sharia law while allowing some level of interpretation from Islamic scholars and judges. The western countries have a different culture compared to the UAE, and the legal systems are different too. Islamic law is considered sacred. Western laws are based on both theoretical and democratic concepts. The UAE’s legal structure on the other hand is highly dependent on religion and Islamic culture. The inheritance law is a lot different in the west and the UAE. Inheritance in the west follows the wills of deceased persons. Compared to the , the focus is on distributing possession amongst the living relatives. They follow a strict method where the family members receive the deceased’s belongings based on their relationship with the deceased’s family, gender and status in the family. Islamic traditions focus heavily on redistributing the belongings of the deceased in this way. For an ex-pat, the laws of your home country do apply in UAE as per the latest changes brought about in the Personal status law in UAE. However, you can still run into legal complications and significant delays. Therefore, you must take the legalities in UAE seriously when it comes to your final will and testament if you want it to be distributed according to the laws of your home country. Conclusion:The difference in laws, culture and social structure of UAE compared to the west is quite significant.

Most of the people planning to visit Australia for study prefer to study in big cities, but they usually do not realize those big cities are not the only locations to find opportunities.

The reason here is that the smaller student associations make it easier to meet and get to know people around you. So, you don’t have to be inside your room and communicate only with the people you already know, but you can actually grow your network as an international student and explore more benefits with a stronger network with different people from different communities.Relaxing lifestyle with Big City AmenitiesWe often see those big cities of Australia like Sydney when we think about the malls, leisure parks, shopping hubs and commercial areas.

{"heading": "ReactJS vs AngularJS – Which one to pick?", "author": "Cris Styris", "description": "ReactJS and AngularJS are both extremely popular frameworks used by any", "word-count": 353, "body": "AngularJSAngular is pretty much the perfect solution for handling data binding. Data binding in Angular apps involves the automatic synchronization of data between the model (or customer input source) and the “view”. When the model changes, the view mirrors the change, and vice versa. By cutting out multiple steps, Angular can be a very appealing option.ReactJSReactJS is an exceptional framework for managing the DOM (Document Object Model), especially when dealing with vast amounts of data. React mainly works by creating a virtual DOM in JavaScript that behaves as an intermediate representation of the DOM. This representation makes it easy to decide which elements to change in the DOM and what the results may be.Comparison:Age:React has just started while Angular has been there since long. So support for Angular is much better. While Angular's coding is more complex, React is easier to use so you need less help from the support communities.Speed &amp; features:Angular JS is more powerful but is little less in speed than React. When there is a huge database to pull data from, users might experience a slight delay. React is faster than Angular JS so works fine while rendering large data. It uses full MVC architecture so it is great for experienced coders to use. It uses only the view component so it less features rich than Angular JS. Beginners should use React.Deployment:Angular JS functions from HTML perspective and provides limited scope of tools for packaging and deploying the code.  While React functions from Javascript perspective and provide a library like RequireJS to load the code.Debugging:With Angular JS its easy to write the code but difficult to debug.  With React, its much easier to debug. You can get React Developers Tools extension for chrome and get started.Who wins: Well the answer is both! Lets use them with each other and not against. React’s pure JavaScript environment gives developers more flexibility and ease of learning. When Angular restricts something, you can expect React to provide full freedom.Equally powerful, use a combination of both in your next big project.  If you are looking for top notch , contact us at Solution Analysts.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/javascript/reactjs-vs-angularjs-which-one-to-pick.html"},

It is a Javascript framework with open source, that is way much better than the first Angular. The main difference is simplification, which means that you won’t find here all those complicated modules and directives that made Angular 1 so complicated and agglomerate. The result was immediate and the performance of the technology increased greatly. Along with that, now the technology supports native app and can render on a server side.The technology gained its popularity due to the name of its creator (Google), more than that, the framework is very easy to learn.Yet, just like every tool, this one has its advantages and disadvantages as well. Among the assets we can list:Lower we listed the disadvantages of the framework:React JS is a library that also has open source and includes JSX  compiler. The fundamental contrast of these systems is that React JS is a library to render your views, not a framework. It became popular because of the Facebook, that backs it up. React JS is a rather SEO friendly technology. And the icing on a case is its high performance and flexibility.The pros of the technology are:And here goes a spoon of tar in a barrel of honey:Making decisionBefore making decision investigate the licencing issues, that may occur. As we said, both technologies are open source, however there still may be some limitations connected with their usage.Model-View-Controller pattern, that lets divide data of the project into tree category and modify each separately if it’s needed is an out-of-the-box feature of Angular 2. Which gives a huge advantage in comparison with React JS, that doesn’t have such option. The other score one for Angular 2 is its ability to display templates writing easily. With this technology you get very clear UI for the data and can get the end result with a really intuitive approach to the UI writing less code. React JS is more complicated with it. The technology needs special functions to control data display. You have to determine the way data is represented before it’s coded into the DOM.Data binding is another question. Angular 2 uses two-way data binding. The data is always directed only in one way, so you always know where your data changes. And this system gets really useful when it goes about debugging.The Performance issues are extremely important when we work with very massive apps. Angular 2 has a watcher for every binding allows to track all the progressions in Dom. One a View gets new updates, the system compares new values with primary meanings. And the problem is that the technology checks not only the meanings that changed but also all of them. This fact as you understand is a bane of Angular’s productivity.React JS and its virtual DOM doesn't need to check new data with the whole system. Once a user entered new data, React created a new virtual Dom and compares it with the previous one. And when the library compares and sees the difference between these two versions, the system rebuilds the virtual DOM. The procedure is performed with the server, thusly reducing the load on a browser. And while there are no active users on a site, React JS performance increases.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/javascript/react-vs-angular-two-sides-of-javascript.html"},

Do you know what you need to do to keep the authorities from knocking on your door or to keep from getting a dreaded cease and desist letter? Fortunately you don’t have to be a lawyer or law scholar to understand the laws that govern blogging,", "word-count": 590, "body": "6 Important Legal Issues Bloggers Need to be Aware ofWhether you write about your financial services or your travel destinations, you want current and potential clients or followers to find your website, get all the info they need and choose you over your competitors.Regardless of the size of your audience or the type of information your website provides, you need to stay informed if you want to avoid legal issues for bloggers.What you say online can be used against you!Here are 6 ways bloggers can stay on the right side of the law:1. Disclose any material relationship with a brand or advertiser.Don’t pretend that you’re not being paid to write a branded post or talk about a new product.Some examples of products or services you should disclose in a related article include:• Free tickets to a game or concert• Products or services you’ve been asked to review• Gifts from companiesIn addition to helping you blog without breaking the law, disclosure also help you build and maintain trust with your audience – it makes good sense all around.2. Avoid making promises.You’re bound by law to talk about what people can generally expect rather than to make outrageous claims. You can’t tell people they’re going to lose 10 pounds overnight by drinking a brand’s tea or look 15 years younger by using a special cream.It doesn’t work to put a “results not typical” disclaimer in the fine print, either. In most cases the company will be the defendant of a consumer-driven class-action suit, but you could still be singled out by unhappy clients or even named in a lawsuit.  3. Understand copyright laws.These protect the original creator of a work - from text and images to audio clips. Many bloggers have gotten in big trouble for using content on blogs that they didn’t create and didn’t ask permission to use.Your best bet when it comes to finding images, audio and video content is to look for sources that provide royalty-free licensed works or works licensed with Creative Commons licenses.4. Know the specific laws around your business.For example, if you’re an attorney, it’s essential to know that from a legal standpoint, giving advice online is considered practicing of law.Only a licensed attorney may give legal advice, and he or she must have formed an attorney-client relationship with whomever they’re giving it to. You’ll need to give your website visitors information that solves their problems without it coming across as legal advice.5. Respect privacy.You’re not allowed to capture private information about visitors and share or sell that info to a third party unless you have permission. If you do collect data about your audience in any way, you need to let them know in your Privacy Policy.If you’re going to send an email newsletter, make sure you ask people before sending them anything. Also, give them a way to opt-out on every email. Canada’s Anti-Spam Law (CASL) and the UK’s GDPR makes it the law to do so or potentially face financial consequences.6. Watch what you say.Many site owners write content around their personal experiences and opinions. However, if you publish untrue information about anyone or anything that could negatively affect a reputation publicly, you could be sued for libel.If you don’t have concrete proof that the negative info you’re publishing is 100% true, don’t publish it.Ignorance isn't a viable defense when it comes to legal issues for bloggers. No matter what your area of expertise is, it’s your responsibility to learn and follow the rules in order to blog without breaking the law.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/javascript/how-to-blog-without-breaking-the-law.html"},

The act from moving between the keyboard and your mouse can also break your flow state due to the movement changes. When it comes to workspaces, IntelliJ, Android Studio, and Eclipse all have the ability for you to configure keyboard shortcuts to suit your most commonly performed actions. Not many developers do this enough when it comes to their workspaces.

at least, not in the way that major religions like to depict them.  I can attest that evil does emanate from these beings.  It’s unmistakable.  If you experience it, you will know.  I am not attaching any meaning to the word evil.  True evil is not the same as our perception of it.  In a sense, evil is a characteristic of these creatures.  It is their nature; much like each of us has our own unique characteristics.Evil spirits may inhabit your immediate environment or, they may share your body.  Again, they are parasites.  They can cause illness to your body and mind.  If you have problems with these entities, it does not mean there is anything wrong with you.  It’s possible for anyone to be in this unfortunate situation.  Be warned that if you provide them with a hospitable environment, they will not leave.I have had a number of personal experiences with these troublesome creatures.  I initially attempted to remove them by taking Epsom salt baths and posting glasses of sea salt around my house.  That didn’t work.  Next, I attempted to drive the spirits out by burning sage, and using a banishing script.  I employed this method several times without success.  These spirits are incredibly stubborn.  I began yelling at them.  I told them that I am in charge and that they must vacate the premises immediately.  One night I was meditating in a dark room, when I suddenly felt a sensation that I would describe as a bug crawling under my left eye.  I looked in a mirror and saw that I had a scratch.  That was the evil being's way of expressing their displeasure with my behavior.  At this point, I realized that these parasites had no intention of leaving.I learned that when you take your focus off these unruly energies, they lose power.  The entities may lay dormant waiting for some poor soul to restore them.  If your moods are stable and you are genuinely enthusiastic, these creatures will have no affect on you.  “Evil spirits” thrive on attention like most things in the multiverse.  If you withhold your attention from dark spirits they either sit in their corner sulking, or they will go on their way.  Do not show them fear.  They have no power over us.  Just ignore them.  Fear encourages them.  Focus on your life.  I have read that what you put your focus on is what you will get.  Think positive.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/link-popularity/astral-parasites.html"},

Thanks to the Facebook team, this feature has helped and blessed the developers.#2 Less time spent in scripting componentsReactJS library has a free syntax extension called JSX which makes scripting the component easy for developers to work with it. This syntax has been designed to make rendering a subcomponent and HTML quoting an easier task. It has its set of writing shortcuts which makes the course codes simpler and cleaner when writing a React createElement.JSX comes in handy during the development of top-tier apps or custom-made components, and makes the process easy to convert HTML mockups into ReactElement trees. Additionally, developers usually get error alerts and messages which are informative, and JSX helps avert code injections.#3 Great set of tools for developersThere are React Developer Tools which are available for Chrome and Firefox. They are the browser extensions for React. With it you can inspect the React component hierarchies in the virtual DOM. You can also select individual components and examine and edit their current properties and state. You can also track the hierarchy of any component and discover both parent and child components.

But the website can get rid of it. Avoid outbound backlinks. Use webmaster tool to track history of backlinks. They will help in filtering good and bad links. Emphasize on quality content. Keep the keyword density at bay. Introduce variation in keywords", "word-count": 447, "body": "What a bad phase it was for some websites in 2011 when Google introduced Penguin algorithm! It thrashed almost 3% websites with its effect (according to shoutmeloud.com). Around 12% of the websites were already facing bout of Panda attack. It’s the time when SEO was preparing for its makeover.  How does a webmaster identify if it’s a penguin attack?What did the affected sites do actually? (Did they commit any crime?) What happened to the affected sites? Did they pay penalty?Let I give the answer of the third question first. Yes, the affected ones had to pay penalty. (Perhaps, a few are still paying it off by facing penalty!).They had to give up their good ranking for long time. SERPs did not provide space in the topmost searches until they fixed them. Even, some high-quality sites disallowed them to enter through nofollow index. And the bad quality link providing sites were left with null link value.What indicates that it’s penguin attack on a website?Now, it’s worth noticing why the search engine penalized them. Be attentive to this question since its answer hides unprecedented signals to identify penguin attack.Let’s walk through the causes of penguin penalty in the points below. These points will provide hints of grey areas which need corrections.Indeed, the search engine has been calling fight against web-spam.  It restricted the way of the spammers who attempted to game with the search results.What actually Penguin algorithm is? How it works?As told in the beginning, 24th September, 2011 was the date when Penguin algorithm was announced. It acts as a link-filter. . It arms webmasters with unparalleled online reputation. The more one has backlinks, the more it will be popular (so the reputation is surely to come).     Some webmasters go out of the way to manipulate rankings of the high quality websites. Such infected web masters plunge to black hat seo. They buy links in bulk and paste it on the website which they want to rank high. They find it the shortcut to achieve ranking in searches.Surely, they accomplish their dream shortly but it remains short-lived. Google keeps watch on such wrong web practices. And implement penguin algo. Sooner, its reputation becomes transient.And if its effects are left undone, the website can be banned forever.How one can cope with it?For sure promotion is his first concern. But the same act can be done by bringing variations in its formulation. Instead of using the phrase ‘Cheaper premium quality carpets’ repeatedly, he must long-tail keywords (like premium quality carpets at cheaper rates or high quality carpets at dirt cheap price). It will look natural and pull organic traffic.    So, diversity is must to have in anchor text every time.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/link-popularity/how-to-find-unnatural-links-recover-from-google-penguin-attack.html"},
{"heading": "Talentless Nana Is a Mind-Boggling Blend of My Hero Academia and Death Note", "author": "Daniel Ryan", "description": "Chihayafuru is an ongoing manga by Yuki Suetsugu, serialized in the Be Love josei magazine with a three-season anime adaptation by Studio Madhouse.", "word-count": 938, "body": "There are very few shows that portray the events from the villain’s perspective. It is not hard to imagine why that is, since it is quite risky to go against the well-established norm of telling the story from the heroes’ standpoint, which almost always works. So, there is little incentive in going the other way, but some shows have done it and have had remarkable success. The most popular when it comes to anime being Death Note. But these are very few, and outliers are not the right example to follow since there are too many failures that try the same thing and go unrecognized. However, when the creators of Talentless Nana faced the same dilemma, they were brave and confident enough to choose the less trodden and riskier path.Source:However, it would be wrong to assume that Talentless Nana seems to have taken inspiration from Death Note only. Since the story takes place in the context of a high school for superpowered students, it would quickly remind anime fans of My Hero Academia. Talentless Nina appears to be a weird and exciting blend of these two popular but different shows. Episode 1The government, considering the threat to humanity, organizes training for superpowered teenagers on a remote island. After their training is concluded, these teenagers will have to fight to protect society from the enemies that wish to take it under their control. Like Izuku from My Hero Academia, Nanao Nakajima, a student with no powers, is bullied by his classmates. However, a new student named Nana Hiiragi, a mind reader, helps him realize that he has powers and is only suppressed because of his inferiority complex. Nana’s analysis works, and Nanao finally finds out he has powers when he protects his classmates from an accident. Much like Eraserhead in My Hero Academia, Nanao, too, can cancel everyone else’s superpowers.However, at the end of the episode, Nana reveals that she is the non-powered character responsible for killing everyone on the island. Nanao’s characterization has taken care of all the details to make it seem that he is the protagonist until the truth is finally revealed. It turns out Nana’s ability to mind read is nothing more than deductive reasoning and cold reading.Episode 2The First Episode of the show will give the viewers the false notion that Talentless Nana is quite like My Hero Academia until the twist. The second episode shows signs that it might have been inspired by Death Note and its protagonist Light Yagami to be specific. Nana, just like Light, is brilliant and has strong deductive skills. Light used to believe that he was killing people for the greater good, which is what Nana thinks that she is killing all the powered superheroes for. Episode two reveals how, when the people with powers first started appearing, they suddenly grew in number. But they soon lost control of their abilities and ended up killing millions of people. The government understood the necessity of keeping things in control before something like this happened again. They concluded that the world would be better off if all the superpowered teenagers were killed before realizing their true potential and caused havoc. However, Nana has a challenging task ahead of herself since she is unaware of how the students’ powers might evolve in the future. So, she has to be mindful of everything that she does. Nana made a very detailed plan before she killed off Nanao. She ensured that Nanao’s powers would not save him from the fall off the cliff. While investigating his disappearance, Nana tries to understand Yohei’s abilities, and through observation, she understands that he can go in the past and change the present. Nana understands that it will be challenging to get rid of Yohei since he might go in the past to change the outcome of his death. So, she has a huge task ahead of herself, Yohei should be killed before he gets to know of Nanao’s death, but his death after Nanao must not raise suspicion on Nana.Episode 3If episode 2 was not enough to draw comparisons with Death Note, the third removes all doubts. A fellow exchange student who got to the island simultaneously as Nana investigates his sister’s disappearance. Kyoya Onodera’s sister disappeared mysteriously, and he wants to find out what happened to her. He is very suspicious of Nana, and she, too, realizes this. He is socially awkward, so he has trouble making friends. Even though he doubts Nana, others trust her since she is so friendly and kind to them. They instead suspect Kyoya. He asks Nana a lot of questions that put her in a spot. So, she then decides that she has to get rid of him as soon as possible before even knowing his powers. She is surprised to find out Kyoya is immortal, so the only person she could have used for his killing was Nanao, but he died. This episode clearly shows many similarities with Death Note as it portrays the same cat and mouse chase. Kyoya is quite like L and Nana, just like Light pretends to be kind and caring. What Next?Until now, the show has impressed a lot of people; it has twists that very few people would be expecting. The characterization is done remarkably well, but there is one question that still needs answering. Where will the story go from here? Will it be like Death Note, a thrilling game of wits? Or will we see it transition to resemble My Hero Academia again? It is tough to say that we will have to wait where the show goes from here.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/link-popularity/talentless-nana-is-a-mind-boggling-blend-of-my-hero-academia-and-death-note.html"},

Note that a company that really works hard to provide good quality programs doesn’t need to make a business of vending computer components.Figure out exactly what each component will be costing. Paying a month for a pc sure is affordable, but following a year, it is likely paid off at 0 and the whose part is the client will still continue to pay after another year since it is a lease, so while technology changes the out-of-date equipment is still being charged as though it were new.

This article explains a complete guide to establish an occupational health and safety (OHS) management system in an organisation.", "word-count": 560, "body": "Losing employees and their productivity due to sickness, accidental injuries, or even mental disturbances can cause significant problems in the production of business. Occupational injuries or health damages cost a lot to the business, which needs to provide compensations to the affected employees in the form of medical assistance or health insurance claims. It is important to have a prominent  that will foster a responsive approach to find and avert workplace hazards or illnesses. An occupational health and safety (OHS) management system ensures the proper collaboration between the employees and the organisation’s management team to identify and assess the risk factors. This collaboration helps to dispense the risks or dissolve any probable risks before they occur.The establishment of strong and inclusive OHS management is a priority for a business if it wants to safeguard its employees and enhance their wellbeing. This article further explains the OHS management process.Training the EmployeesThe first step to protecting your employees from accidental risks or illnesses is training. The more they are aware of possible health and safety hazards, the better they can prevent any harm to themselves. Thus, training and awareness programs are needed to let the employees know what things can happen in their workplace and what they can do to fight against those odds. With the help of specialised occupational health and safety consultants, formulate your training program and coordinate it with the employees. You need to provide repetitive and involved training sessions with practical situations/examples to help employees clearly understand their role in ensuring their safety.  Medical Support at WorkplaceThis is highly necessary to prevent any negligence towards employees when a mishap occurs, physical injuries are encountered, or any health problem is observed. A medical assistance team must be present or close to the workplace where any injured employees can easily receive treatment. Apart from immediate medical support, the medical team should also work to collaborate with the business to conduct regular medical examinations or health screenings of the employees. This is also called general medical surveillance, and it is needed to prevent any occupational illnesses.Accessing WorkplacePeriodic inspections and evaluations of the workplace is necessary to find the potential risks or the hazards that are prevalent. Management needs to classify the hazards as recurring or new ones, and they should identify the trends of the risks, injuries, or sicknesses of the employees, collecting information to investigate their root causes. Proper assessment of workplace hazards and health risks will lead to the introduction of effective hazard prevention programs. Effective Hazard Prevention PlanA proper hazard control plan with a hierarchy of controls need to be established so that every health hazard encountered or suspected is systematically averted. The most effective hierarchy of controls that will help to prevent workplace hazards is as follows- elimination (physically removing the hazard), substitution (replacing the hazard), engineering controls (isolating employees from the hazard), administrative controls (changing the work structure or process), and PPE (providing employees with personal protective equipment).Promoting a coherent and responsive health and safety management system is an important need of every organisation to ensure the protection of its employees. Besides preventing loss of productivity to the businesses, it will also lead to workplace morale improvement, increase in turnover (due to fewer sick leaves), savings (due to fewer claims of medical insurance), and a better reputation in the business (due to the safe work environment).", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/management/guide-to-occupational-health-and-safety-management-for-enterprises.html"},
{"heading": "A Complete Guide to Reducing Costs for Quality Assurance Certification", "author": "Alex Afford", "description": "This article talks about the cost for businesses in achieving quality assurance certification and provides businesses with a guide to optimizing the costs.", "word-count": 646, "body": "The cost of getting certified with ISO 9001 or any other quality assurance certification can be substantial, which may scare away some organizations, making them hesitant to achieve it. Outsourcing experts in quality assurance services and maintaining the operation of the quality management system (QMS) add to the costs of the certification processes. However, looking at the broader and long-term perspective, the costs are recovered with productive efficiency and higher profit due to higher customer satisfaction.Instead of giving attention to the worries about the cost of certification, understand the journey of the certification and the costs involved in it. Some costs can be reduced with wiser decisions. Here is an estimation of the costs and certain ways to reduce them to derive the maximum return of the investment.Costs of ISO Certification Explained• Outsourcing Fees: These are the charges made by the quality assurance agency for and other certification services, such as gap analysis, readiness review, training, and internal audits.• Internal Resources Costs: The organization needs to spend some time and money on resources (such as staff training, team allocation, monitoring, tools for analysis) to complete the implementation of the QMS. These are the internal costs involved in the certification process.• Registration Services Costs: A reputed, authorized registrar is needed to conduct the final certification audit and decide whether the organization is eligible to be certified. Registration costs involve fees of the audit officers, travel expenses, and administration fees. Also, the registration fees depend on the size of the organization, the intricacies of its processes, and how comprehensive it’s QMS is. Apart from these inevitable costs, there are certain post-certification expenses as well! Every ISO certificate is valid for 3 years and needs to be renewed. The organization needs to conduct surveillance audits at least twice a year with professional auditors to ensure their QMS is consistently in compliance with the ISO 9001 standard. Several Assured Ways to Check the Costs of CertificationHere are certain ways to reduce the costs for ISO certification.Understand the ISO 9001 Standard ClearlyThis is necessary to ensure that your QMS and strategy for quality management meets the ISO 9001 requirements. Thoroughly understanding each of its clauses from your appointed ISO consultants.Choose the Agency of Consultants WiselyHire a team of consultants who can help you with the entire process of the certification and you will not need any other agencies for further assistance. Reach out to multiple consultancy agencies to choose the one that provides all-round assistance and charges a reasonable price for their services. Provide TrainingEducate your employees about the ISO 9001 requirements and give them training on the implementation and operation of the QMS. Hold workshops, seminars, or learning courses so that they can enhance their capabilities during the implementation. Training will make the employees competent in the processes, which will minimize risks in the process. This will help organizations save costs.Efficient Allocation of ResourcesDesignate the staff with proper resources, set appropriate timelines, and define a systematic approach to implement the QMS. Perform the audit with efficient internal auditors to check the compliance of the QMS against the ISO requirements. Using the accessible resources (including staff) wisely will ensure that your business achieves certification quickly.Perform a Gap analysisWith the help of your appointed consultants or experts, do a gap analysis of your business’s preexisting QMS. It will help you know what needs to be incorporated in the QMS to modify it and make it eligible for ISO 9001.Do not let the costs of certification stop you from getting certified! The key is to do it right, and the best thing about any ISO certification is that it gives the organization enough liberty on how to achieve it. So, you can decide which  agency to hire, how to plan your QMS implementation, and how to improve its efficiency. You can do so wisely by investing the least costs and spending fewer resources.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/management/a-complete-guide-to-reducing-costs-for-quality-assurance-certification.html"},

We as humans are so inclined towards the happenings in other people’s lives that we couldn’t restrain ourselves from offering our expertise on everything.", "word-count": 718, "body": "Haven't we all come across the so-called MARRIAGE advice given enthusiastically by our expert friends, families, relatives, and sometimes even outsiders. We as humans are so inclined towards the happenings in other people’s lives that we couldn’t restrain ourselves from offering our expertise on everything.Marriages are different, and it would be absolute stupidity to consider two marriages to be the same. It would be wrong to expect that what worked for one marriage would work for yours.Finding a life partner isn’t a big deal. You could easily find your life partner through top-rated popular matrimonial sites in India. But only if you could close your mind to unsolicited advice could you make your marriage a happy one. 1. Only marriage can bring happiness.Whom are we kidding? Humans have made their mark on mars, and we still cannot get rid of these age-old notions. Undoubtedly, marriages are beautiful, exceptional, and phenomenal. But is it the only way towards a happy life? No. Just like other crucial decisions in life, marriage is a decision taken by two mature individuals who wish to stay together. As simple as that. One can stay happy being simple, married, or divorced. We as a society have to give up on notions that say singles cannot stay happy. 2. Marriages are perfect when you find your soul mate.No marriage is ever perfect. In fact, no human being is perfect. Marriages are beautiful when partners within it understand the differences and value each other. Marriage doesn’t work on their own. It requires constant effort; till the very end to keep it alive. Besides, who out there knows the definition of a perfect marriage? 3. Arguments are bad for the health of a marriage.Arguments don’t make for a bad relationship. Unresolved conflicts and buried issues do. Arguments are crucial as long as the motive is to find solutions. The moment it becomes the race of proving oneself, the marriage fails. When two people live with each other, arguments are bound to happen. Correctly addressing such issues is truly a representation of a healthy marriage. 4. Ignore your problems.Just let go of your problems by not bothering your partner. Like really, how is this advice even healthy/You see ignoring the problems would only sweep it aside for a time being till it becomes a huge issue. Bottling up your feelings would lead to a dissatisfied and unhappy marriage. 5. Good marriage comes with an ability to read your partner’s mind.This is one of the worst pieces of advice for sustaining any marriage. Communication is vital for a smooth married life. You see, your partner isn’t a superhuman and nor, are you. You couldn’t peek into their minds and understand what is bothering them. You have to talk it out and find solutions to your problem. Save yourself from a dissatisfied marriage by not assuming your partner to be a mind reader. 6. Your spouse would complete you.Marriage isn’t a loss of individuality. Your partner couldn’t make up for your insecurities and fears. You have to work on it. Only when you as an individual would have a strong personality could you add life to your marriage. Your partner cannot complete you. The concept of better half is as vague as this false notion. Marriage is a 100-100 contribution of two individuals who make for an excellent team. 7. Everything would eventually work out.Marriage requires efforts for sustenance. It doesn’t work out on its own. People need to understand the humongous difference between wedding and marriage. A wedding doesn’t ensure constant marital bliss. It's the efforts that count. When you put in efforts into your marriage, you prioritize it and ensure that everything eventually works out. Many times this advice comes from a pure intention of helping you out. But you need to understand that accepting this unsolicited advice as truth could do more harm to your marriage than being beneficial.Summing up, is someone near to you looking for a matrimonial (marriage) sites in India?

And, ending this marriage on whatsoever ground is still not considered normal. Yet, in recent decades we can see an increase in the divorce rate in India. There is a common notion that the reason for the increasing divorce rate is because of an increase in love marriage. Let’s break that notion for you.The increasing divorce rate is related to various social aspects. Arrange marriage is still prevalent in India. And, divorces in arrange marriage setup are as common as love marriages.We have our associates spread wide across the country. They help us curate a distinct and vast database to cater to the needs of our clientele base. Now, we do have well-curated profiles of  to help you get started. With tons of alternatives, you won’t have to settle for anything less. Let’s walk you through the 6 common reasons for increasing divorces in India. 1. Women’s independence.The status of women has changed over the years. They are no longer mere housewives. Women today are financially, socially, physically, and mentally independent. This comes in the way of an age-old mentality where women’s only role was to nurture families.Besides, society is still hesitant to see women progress. Hence, even the so-called progressive ones lose their cool when the women are doing better than their spouse. This is particularly true about the financial aspect. Men still cannot digest it when their wives earn better than them.Ego clashes lead to dissatisfaction from marriage. This in turn leads to divorce. Women these days are ready to walk off a marriage that isn’t working for them.Increasing women’s independence has much to do with increasing divorce rates. Even when it cannot be explained on paper.2. Trauma.This includes both, physical and mental trauma. Physical abuse by men on their wives is an age-old problem. We won’t say, there aren’t any cases of physical abuse on men. But generally speaking, women are exploited by their husbands for ages. Domestic violence is a major reason for increasing divorce cases.Mental trauma is less spoken of but it definitely leads to marriage failure. The educated and modern cohort is okay with working women. But they are not okay with shared responsibilities when it comes to household chores. Working women are expected to manage jobs, families, children effectively without any helping hand from husbands. Hence, women walk out of such marriages that are mentally traumatic.3. Relations with in-laws.Nearly 68% of married couple stays with the parents. As they say, marriage in India is with families. While the families can help sustain a marriage, they also are the root cause of divorce in many cases. The degrading relations within laws often lead to divorce. The most common cause being the relation between mother in law and daughter in law.When the relations worsen and become toxic, marriages dissolve. There are many cases where extreme involvement from a girl’s family has resulted in divorce.4. Dominance.As mentioned earlier, women these days are financially, mentally, physically, and socially independent. Women must have a choice and voice in their relationship. But, dominance still exists. The man of the family still takes all the major decisions. Be it for childcare, spending, relationship, or others. Hence, when a woman feels overpowered they walk out of marriage.The same scenario applies to men. A manipulative hold of wives would often lead to divorce. Modern marriages seek equality. And, when that is not the case, marriages dissolve.5. Adultery.Affairs outside marriage are quite common. But, hey just because it’s common it’s not the right thing to do. Earlier, women use to let go of their husband’s affairs because they were Dependent on them. Besides, society wasn’t accepting of divorcee women back then. Not much has changed even today. Though, partners these days would mutually end the marriage instead of stretching it.The percentage of women cheating on their partners is as high as the other. So, either way, anyone can walk out of the marriage, when the partner is caught off guard.6. Lack of communication.Many modern marriages fail just because both the partner grows distant with time. Daily life takes a toll on the quality of marriage. Communication stops and instead of resolving the issues, partners end the marriage.As they say, communication is more important than love in marriage. Those who know it, preserve it.Is increasing divorce rate a matter of worry? Well, definitely if the root cause of marriage failure is something that can be figured. That is to say, most of the marriages end for baseless reasons. Marriage like every other relation requires efforts. When the efforts stop, relation dies.Lastly, divorce doesn’t mean the end of life. As the quote says,“Divorce isn’t such a tragedy. The tragedy is staying in an unhappy marriage.”You can always remarry. Or you can stay single. Life is beautiful.But, if you’ve been looking for  that can help you remarry, we can help you out.

If you are looking for a great and newly successful marketing technique, you need to learn about lifecycle marketing, as offered by a lifecycle marketing agency.The Three Steps of the Lifecycle Marketing CycleLifecycle marketing can be broken down into three steps of a cycle: attracting new customers, selling to those customers, and finally wowing them with your excellent customer experience. It is a simple framework, but it’s highly effective if you can complete all three steps with customers.Attracting New CustomersThe first step to almost any marketing technique is attracting customers to your business. There are a lot of methods of attracting new customers, and to start with, you want to do some research: narrow down what demographics of customers are purchasing your products or services already, and identify which may potentially be interested in them. You want to narrow down your marketing to target your ideal demographics in order to have the best chance of expanding your customer base. If you try to target too many people, you may end up not getting to anybody at all.Knowing your ideal demographic target for your business, you then try to attract their interest through various marketing techniques, whether it is on social media, through compelling website content, by advertising, using PPC advertising, or by organizing events or giveaways. Once you have attracted customers in, you should try to gather their contact information through opt-in marketing forms. Using irresistible offers can improve your chance of getting their information.Selling to New CustomersOnce you have attracted new customers, you need to convert them into sales for your marketing to actually be successful. Not everybody that visits your site or storefront for the first time is going to immediately buy anything, so you need to convince them. The first step is to educate them about your products or services in a captivating manner by placing interesting content on your site about your company, about each product and service, and about other related interests. Next you want to offer your customers a reason to purchase your product or service. This doesn’t necessarily mean offering coupons or discounts; just relating to a problem they have and showing them a solution using your products or services can be enough. Lastly, you want to close the deal, not just with an exchange of money, but also by offering them great delivery, communication, and the foundation for a lasting relationship with them.Wowing Your CustomersGaining returning customers is the end goal of , and in order to get a customer to come back to you again, you have to wow them on their first purchase from you—and then you need to continue to wow them with customer support afterwards, and by communicate new offerings as you make them available. A way to continue to engage with customers can be as simple as continuing to provide them interesting content, tips, or resources through email or social media. You can also wow them by showing them interesting cross-sell products they may not have considered, or by upselling them with warranties or special programs.Your ultimate goal when wowing your customers is referrals: asking them to refer their friends, families, or colleagues to what you are offering. By having given them a “wow”-worthy experience, they will have no problem recommending you. Make it easy for your customers to refer others through landing pages for referrals and social media sharing options.A lifecycle marketing agency can help your small business navigate the steps of lifecycle marketing to provide you with research data on target customers, interesting content to attract them, and easy means of converting them into sales.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/marketing/how-lifecycle-marketing-can-help-your-small-business-grow.html"},

We can’t advertise our products and services to the world at large but we don’t have to be able to do that to be able to make a pretty decent living… thanks to the Internet.Niche marketing is selling specific products or services to a limited audience. One person with a computer, an internet connection and a good idea can go into business for himself on the Internet and target the people who would be most interested in what he has to sell and do all of the above on a very limited advertising budget.Finding the right niche for what you have to sell isn’t really all that difficult. Just think about who the people are who would be most interested in what you have to sell. For example, if you have concocted a shampoo formula that will take chlorine out of a person’s hair, you can’t compete with giant companies that sell shampoo but you can narrow your market down to a niche and target sales to those who have swimming pools. You buy a domain, get a server, and build a website to advertise your product JUST to people who have swimming pools.In essence, niche marketing is selling a product or service to those who want or need the product the most.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/marketing/what-niche-marketing-really-is.html"},

Take the example of PlexusHQ. They have a great line of protein shakes to help people build up their muscular strength, trim the fat, and lead a healthy lifestyle. Once word gets out, these products sell themselves. But the trick is to find someone who loves the product, and is willing to jump into the business venture too.Stay FocusedIt's best not to try and convince your buddy/coworker/spouse/friend/customer to sign up for your MLM enterprise. They're not interested, and all you're doing is annoying them.Who do you want to focus on? People who have already created a successful business enterprise, and are ready for the next opportunity. You can find these people through networking events, conventions, and even building up a relationship with local businesspeople by visiting their businesses.Network in Real LifeEnsure everyone knows what you do, and have business cards ready to hand out, after you have introduced yourself to someone. Don't make outrageous claims in public—it'll turn people off. You're a successful business person who is no different than if you were the owner of a successful corporation or financial institution. If people see you as successful, rather than desperate, they may just follow up to see how they can be like you too.Create An Online PresenceEven if you meet people at networking events, or sell directly to local customers, they are going to look you up online. This is to ensure A) You're a genuine business; and B) You are an authority or expert in your field. This means having a great website, with blog, full of information.You should also be on all the common social media channels. Give people something to think about, and they'll give you a call or send you an email if they're interested.Advertise on Successful MLM SitesInstead of just paying for Google ads, or for targeted ads, find the most successful MLM businesspeople and ask if you can place your company ad on their site. This way you're already screening your prospects down to people who are truly interested in these ventures, and you've only spent under $65 for it.Provide a SolutionDon't just pitch your opportunity, truly listen to people's goals, their feelings, and their wants and needs.

This one tool can turn your MLM marketing into a hotspot and bring you real relationships that last a lifetime. Many marketers are spending tons of dollars on trying to gain traction when they can use this one weapon that we all have. Read on to find out what it is.  Live events are wonderful places to meet and greet people from all over the world. Mlm marketing is not about the war of numbers, but how to qualify those who you do meet and align with the person’s needs. Many times, a networking pro may feel intimidated by the sheer volume of prospects or the authority that is at such events. Everyone started off at the lowest rung on the ladder at some point. However, there is one secret weapon that you may be better at than anyone else. This secret weapon doesn’t cost money, but it does cost time. It is listening, not passive listening, but a fully engaged and active listening that turns people into leads and joining your downline. Most people cannot say they are active listeners, but those who do listen do it very well. This is an art that MLM marketing doesn’t teach very well unless your mentor is totally old school. Active listening is a process that pushes all distractions aside and keeps your mouth closed while the person is speaking. This doesn’t mean that you should not say something, it does mean not to focus on your next comment though.   While at home, working at your MLM marketing, it may be difficult to listen to people. However, there is good news for you. You can still practice with your loved ones, children, neighbors and friends that come over. It is a process of allowing what they said to sink in and you process it to its fullest value. This means clearing out the clutter in the mind and allowing them to say what they need to say. At natural pauses, you can ask questions or show support for whoever is speaking. People like talking, and it can be very difficult to keep one’s mouth zipped without interjecting.

It happens occasionally when I connect with a spirit that’s come for one of my clients – a few naughty phrases that slip out in the privacy of a one-on-one reading. “Did your father curse a lot?” I’ll ask, and get a nodding head in reply. But when off-colour remarks pop out when I’m serving at a Spiritualist church – yikes! A few blue words, and I’m red in the face.I’ll never forget seeing in my mind a tall, good-looking man with wavy brown hair and a thick mustache. He wore a sleek black leather coat, and the first three buttons on his Hawaiian print shirt were open, revealing a well-toned chest. I described what I was getting to the congregation, but no one raised a hand to claim him.Come on, I mentally spoke to the spirit. Give me some more information about yourself so someone can identify you.Suddenly, I heard loud, thumping music. The fellow gave me a lascivious smile, then started shimmying and taking off his clothes. My jaw dropped. As he wriggled out of his shirt, he winked and showed me perfect six-pack abs. The guy could’ve stepped off the cover of a Harlequin paperback.When he undid his belt and loosened his pants, I turned away. But you can’t turn your back on spirit! He laughed at my embarrassment and whispered, Gene. I passed that name on to the group.A young woman in the second row gasped. “Might that be Jean?” she asked, giving his name a French inflection.“Possibly,” I said, then cleared my throat. “Was he, uh… a stripper?”The woman laughed. Jean stopped dancing when he got down to his G-string – thank goodness! – and I helped the young woman connect with a former boyfriend who had died last year in a car crash. Jean blew his girlfriend a kiss and, before returning to spirit, gave me another wink.I blew out a breath, then paused to take a hearty drink of water. I had to do something to lower my temperature. Whew!Another time I felt the presence of an older woman, and in my inner ear I heard mother. I described her as a bit rotund, with brightly painted nails and blonde hair out of a bottle. She passed into spirit from lung cancer in her late 70s, and chain-smoked unfiltered Camel cigarettes until the day she died.I glommed onto a middle-aged fellow in the audience as if a flashlight were trained on his face; spirit was directing me to whom the message belonged. He sat with his arms crossed over his chest, and a look on his face like he’d rather be cleaning a cat box than listening to messages from spirit. “I think this woman came for you,” I said, pointing at him. “Are you alright with it?”He shrugged. His wife, sitting beside him, giggled and elbowed him in the stomach.“I feel this is your mother,” I told him. “She says you’re expecting to be the last person in the world to hear from someone. Well, guess what? You’re here, and so am I!”I noticed my stance: right hand on my hip, left hand pointing at him. “Is this how your mother would stand?”He nodded.“Damn right!” I said, then caught myself and turned away, embarrassed. Oh my God, I thought, you’re not supposed to swear in church!I can’t remember what else I said to the fellow, but after the service I apologized profusely to the minister. She chuckled and said she understood. “Sometimes,” she said, “even spirit makes me blush.”", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/metaphysical/sometimes-i-blush.html"},

Some campaigns can help you grow your business.", "word-count": 392, "body": "A network marketing campaign is a series of planned content to trigger results from an audience. Some campaigns can help you grow your business, by testing the content and setting up SMART goals that allow you to measure and alter on a month to month basis. SMART means specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-based and they can be short to long term for your business. These goals will help you develop a growth marketing mindset that drives you to reach out to your prospects in a positive way.   Growing a network marketing business can be fun and challenging at the same time. You can grow your business on your own terms. You don’t have to wait for the right season or some other distracting element. A principal factor to consider in developing a growth mindset is finding opportunities in your marketing area that you can target with ideas. Your network marketing business does not have to be limited to one area. You could be missing out on channels that have a larger audience base than what you have now. You can scale your growth in degrees or percentages without having to feel obligated to go full tilt when you don’t have the resources to do so. Please realize growth marketing is not an overnight adventure, it will require time and experimentation on your part. You cannot limit yourself to one or two types of content and hope the receiver will catch the pass.   If you’re ready to grow your network marketing business, you need to measure and analyze your content. Measuring content will show you if your efforts are gaining traction, engaging your audience or if people are just bypassing your messages. If you have successful content, you can exploit these messages in innovative ways to help improve your overall business goals. This will also show you weak areas that you can improve on. However, you will have to do a snapshot of your content and other goals and run the test for at least one month to see if there is growth. If you don’t have benchmark data, take the snapshot and run your campaign for a month and then see where you stand. Every piece of content will perform differently, some will do better and others will flop. Learn from both sides and focus on creating content that answers problems.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/mlm/growth-marketing-mindset-for-network-marketing-pros-overview.html"},

Direct selling and network marketing are two forms of marketing approaches. In the first case, the distributor earns revenue for independent marketing ability while in network marketing, one earns for the team effort.", "word-count": 619, "body": "Direct selling is a marketing approach that concerns about selling the product to customers via a representative or a distributor from the concerned direct selling organization directly. Usually, the commission earned for independent sales is the only revenue of a distributor. The marketing and selling of products are managed through a  system.A distributor prefer various methods to make sales like,With the above methods, revenue can be increased to reach a better value.These representatives or sales consultants are solely responsible for product sales and they can be tagged as “self-employed” status. The tax which the consultant obliged to pay is done by their own efforts, and the organization is not responsible for those matters.Moving onto the next side, network marketing is more a referral system where distributors earn a commission for not just their independent sales but also for the sales made by their team. It’s a combined effort and the revenue earned might be more or less depending upon the activeness of your group.Sales from downline members will also be taken into consideration while calculating the commissions of the distributors. Building a network alongside sales is what  stresses out for if it’s just about referring more people and getting paid will fall under “pyramid schemes”.Earning commissions might be calculated based on achieving a certain volume of sales or referrals or ranks. It depends on the organization and the criterion is chosen by them.Not everyone is aware of the difference between direct selling and network marketing, not even network marketers in the industry.

The  perfectly captures the free-wheeling counterculture essence of the band's leading lady, Grace Slick.Rising amidst the boiling pot of artists that orbited around Haight-Ashbury in the sixties, Jefferson Airplane came to inhabit the dais of honoured talent shared by their Bay Area contemporaries , , , and . Long names and even longer shadows.A nestled gem, the two and half minute trance sparkled amidst the golden plated Surrealistic Pillow, and broadcast the hippie ideals of its time. As Airplane founder Marty Balin put it: 'It was timely for the ear. The myth, the idea, the acid.'Unsurprisingly, Slick took open inspiration from Lewis Carroll's dreamscape masterpiece Alice's Adventures In Wonderland. The fluid surrealism and perceptive alterations imbued Carroll's work with a .With character reference's to a spacey Alice, the hookah-smoking caterpillar, the White Knight, Red Queen, the Dormouse, and of course the White Rabbit, the influence is clear.But does either work explicitly relate to drugs? Despite encountering pills that make you larger or smaller and eating 'some kind of mushroom' that leaves 'your mind moving low', Grace Slick is adamant the song does not refer to drugs.For Slick, the song 'is about following your curiosity. The White Rabbit is your curiosity.'In 2016, at the age of 76, Ms. Slick also blamed it on lousy parents with their 'glasses of scotch.''They also seemed unaware that many books they read to us as kids had drug use as a subtext. Peter Pan uses fairy dust and can fly, Dorothy and her friends in “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz” cut through a poppy field and wind up stoned and fast asleep.'Slick also sees the song as a liberating call to arms for intelligence and education, to 'feed your head'.Funnily enough, Lewis Carroll indulged in drugs while he wrote Alice's Adventures In Wonderland. He may have taken opiate-infused drug Laudanum (which was readily available to everyone in the 1860s), though his personal journals make no explicit mention of drugs or other mind-altering substances.Slick wrote White Rabbit at her home in Marin County in 1966. She had purchased a small upright piano for $80 at a warehouse San Francisco, on which she wrote many of Jefferson Airplane's earliest songs.'It was painted about 90 coats of bright red and was missing around 10 keys in the upper register. I didn’t play way up there anyway—the notes were too pingy—so I bought it. Jerry and I put the piano in our living room.'Fittingly, Slick wrote the piece at the end of an acid trip during which she listened to  Sketches Of Spain for 24 hours straight. The Spanish beat that defines White Rabbit is also influenced by Ravel's Bolero. Then she presented it to her bandmates, San Francisco raga-folk avatars the Great Society, who included Grace's husband, drummer Jerry Slick, brother-in-law Darby Slick on lead guitar, bassist Peter Van Gelder on bass and rhythm guitarist Dave Minor.Sitting at over six minutes the original version was much trippier, and three times the length, of Airplane's single version. It was Eastern flavoured, with an improvised raga intro and Slick's vocals were more contrived.Then came a benefit show at the Fillmore in September 1966. Sharing the bill with a crumbling Great Society were Jefferson Airplane, then searching for a new singer. Airplane bassist Jack Casady had seen Grace several times and wanted her in.“I liked Grace’s singing because we wanted a good, aggressive singer for the band,” says Casady, “She had a unique timbre and sound to her voice; Signe [Anderson], who was our first singer, came out of a folk background and had a contralto voice with smooth harmonies. What I like about Grace was the fact she stood right at the end of the stage and made good contact with the audience.'Airplane manager Bill Thompson drafted Grace's contract for a measly $750 and Slick was signed, replacing the clear belled folk tones of Anderson with a fiery, strident approach. And in the following month, the band set out to record Surrealistic Pillow. Casady recalls the day Jefferson Airplane recorded it: “We recorded it out at Sunset and Ivar, in a huge room at RCA where they used to record A Hundred And One Strings. The room was massive, so we basically set up the instrumentation in the middle of this room and played it live onto four-track. It was very simple to record. I just led the song out as a bass part like Bolero, ripping off Ravel. It was all slow and slinky, it gave us the atmosphere we wanted.”With with fellow San Fran tripper, Jerry Garcia, credited as 'musical and spiritual advisor', the album was a massive success, peaking at #3 on the US Billboard chart and consolidating Airplane's status as a .Grace Slick is still synonymous with Alice's Adventure In Wonderland, through her time with Jefferson Starship and beyond. Now retired in from the music business, she now runs a one-woman art show in Malibu. Her most popular work, funnily enough, is a series of paintings based on the Alice books.It seems Slick has lost none of her free-thinking ideologies either. In 2017, she licensed the  song Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now to  to use in a TV commercial, but because she disagrees with Chick-fil-A's corporate views on same-sex marriage she gave all of the proceeds of that deal to Lambda Legal, an organization that works to advance the civil rights of LGBTQ people and everyone living with HIV.It shouldn't come as a surprise that someone who could pen a timeless ode to following one's curiosity would still be committed to art and progressive ideas well after the music had stopped. It turns out chasing the White Rabbit  - at least in Grace Slick's case - can be a lifetime pursuit.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/metaphysical/lsd-and-24-hour-jazz-the-story-of-jefferson-airplanes-white-rabbit.html"},
{"heading": "Manifest Your Dreams - Discover The 8 Secrets To Manifesting Your Desires", "author": "Iona Kristina", "description": "In this article are 8 things that you need to take note of and practice in your life to manifest your dreams and attract what you desire easily and successfully.", "word-count": 869, "body": "Manifesting your dreams often require modifying your daily habits, patterns of thinking, and what you give your energy to. It's about desiring, and then aligning.And in this short document are 8 things that you need to take note of and practice in your life to manifest your dreams and attract what you desire easily and successfully. These things are like reminders or habits of what to do in order to allow the flow of your desire into your experience, instead of blocking or impeding your progress. Let's begin.1. Let go of justifying what you do not want.This first thing that you need to adopt and practice is all about not continuously talking to yourself or to other people about what is unwanted or what it is that you dislike. In our day to day interactions, we have the tendency to talk to others about our complaints, about things not working out, and about the problems we encounter. Switch this habit off and refrain from adding momentum to what you do not want because this is one crucial reason why your manifestations can't come.2. Do not get hung up in the contrasting experience.Every difficulty or contrasting experience we encounter always has the purpose of letting us be clear about what we want to happen. It lets us clarify our desire. And the thing to keep in mind here is that once an experience has already served this purpose for you, your work now is to focus your attention on the clarification it has brought you, instead of getting stuck in the contrast. Ask yourself, 'what is it that I want to happen now?', and let your focus stay there. It's never looking back and living the contrast again, as this will likewise impede your manifesting progress.3. Go with the flow of what you want.Once you are already clear with what you want, you then cultivate the habit of moving in its direction. You want to maintain thoughts, conversations, beliefs, and actions that are harmonious with what you desire to happen. This means staying in alignment with the energy flow of what you want and let it gain enough momentum to manifest in the physical world.4. Create the perfect vibrational atmosphere around you.This 4th secret to manifesting is all about being conscious and deliberate in creating a good feeling atmosphere in you and around you at all times. It's about moving away from things that will mess up the positive energy around you, and going after the things that promote feelings of joy, appreciation, peace, harmony and love. Stay away from judgment, anger, blame, worry, or fear as this will introduce contradiction in your vibration.5. Adjust your vibration as needed to allow what you desire.Whenever you encounter situations that tend to mess up with the positive energy, adjust your vibration accordingly by going general, by soothing the way you feel, and by talking yourself out of the negativity. This adjusting of your energy vibration is what being a deliberate creator means. You are continuously molding your own energy as you move along in your waking life.6. Be a match to what you want and not the absence of it.This secret is all about releasing the need to constantly monitor the manifestation of your desire and to take score of your progress too often. Because as you do this, you are matching your thoughts to the absence or lack of it, and you then move farther away to bringing it into existence.7. Feel good while not having the desire yet.Be in a stable place of allowing your desires by letting the emotion be what you are primarily aiming for at the start. Let your initial intention be to feel good mostly, and to live in the trust and knowing that the Universe will certainly deliver. Maintain feeling good in knowing that it's in the process of unfolding for you, and cultivate the right amount of patience by trusting the perfect Universal timing. Feeling good now is one of the keys to successfully manifesting.8. Use your ability to focus and be the genius creator that you naturally are.This last secret is using the powerful ability that you have to conjure up your own mood and feelings through your own power of focus. This is all about using your mind, your wonderful thinking mechanism, to be in a constant state of alignment with good-feeling thoughts and emotions. When used consciously and deliberately, this secret will allow the seamless flow of good things in your life because you are not anymore blocking them in any way.ConclusionIn summary, the key secret to manifest your dreams and desires in life is being in alignment with the energy vibration of what you want in your thoughts, words, beliefs, and actions. It is maintaining focus on what you want to happen, instead of paying more attention to the absence or lack of it.I'm sharing with you my Best Resource For Effortless Manifesting. A simple tool to manifest your desires, be in vibrational alignment with what you want, release subconscious limiting beliefs, and unleash your true power within -- all by just pushing Play.

{"heading": "Manifesting And Law Of Attraction: Why Hard Work Is Not Necessary And Is Counterproductive", "author": "Iona Kristina", "description": "In this short article, discover why the energy of hard work is counterproductive to manifesting your desires, and what the better approach is to law of attraction manifestation.", "word-count": 808, "body": "Why Is The Energy Of Hard Work Counterproductive To Manifesting?The energy of hard work signifies lack, deficiency or something missing. It communicates that what you want is not easily coming about. It means chasing too much for something you desire, and that in the present moment, you are not doing enough.And since the Law of Attraction responds to the energy vibration you are offering and gives you more of what you put out there, this contradictory energy of hard work means you've got less Universal leverage. You are moving in the opposite energy direction of what you want. You are blocking the flow of assistance and support that you would naturally have when you ease up a bit. It Means You've Got ResistanceIn hard work and effort, there is resistance. You have opposing vibrations within you. You are moving upstream or against the current, and carrying out your action from a place of misaligned energy. With hard work, you have contradictory energies that will not allow the Universal help you naturally have access to. There Is Another WayA more productive way of action is being in the flow. It is coming from a place of having an aligned energy first before moving into action. In this, a lot more work can be done because you are in sync with the timing of every action, and everything you need falls into place at the perfect schedule.Being in the flow means lining up your energy within yourself. It is managing and cleaning up your vibrations, which is the real work that needs to be done first. Because it is through vibration that you create. When you are more chilled out, instead of worrying about things and trying hard to make things happen, you are more open to the receiving of the right goods, to come at the right time. You are in the flow of the Universal current. It's Always Vibration FirstAlways remember that the most important work is the vibrational work, in order for the things you desire to come filling in your experience. Feel good first and then the inspired action will become effortless for you, instead of it feeling like a chore or hard work on your part.You will then notice that a lot of work will be done for you because energy is flowing seamlessly. You are letting the Universe do the heavy lifting. Pieces of things will fall into its rightful place, and the perfect ideas and people will keep coming, without the need to manage or chase after them. The New ApproachThis is the vibrational approach to accomplishing things, instead of relying solely on physical hard work. It is making sure that your inner world is in order before getting outer stuff done.In hard work, there is an effort to justify your worthiness to receive what you want. There's an underlying belief that you do not deserve to receive something that you haven't worked hard for, and that what you want is not easy that's why it continues to become hard for you.But when you are grounded in your own worthiness, you can then relax into your own knowing, as you are already deserving to receive from the moment you have asked for something. You will now come from a place of trusting yourself and the Universal forces to orchestrate everything that is necessary and appropriate for your highest good.Feel worthy and be happy. And trust life more. What Your Primary Work Now IsPut your effort into doing things that align your energy and raise your vibration. Because Law of Attraction is always at work and is responding to you. And as you do these inner vibrational work, you are able to accomplish things while at the same time feeling good.Inspiration will just carry you into the right action as you do the aligning first. Decide to let go of unnecessary effort that will produce little or minuscule results, in comparison to what you will achieve with Universal alignment.Always note that there is more effort involved when energy is not aligned first. And whenever you effort too much with action, it just means you haven't done the inner energy work first, that's why it feels like resistance or friction. ConclusionIn summary, always remember to line up your energy so you are charged and flowing alongside the entire Universal forces – along with the powerful stream of Life. And from that place of alignment, you will be inspired to the most satisfying action to take from wherever you are, and produce the most satisfying results. My Recommended Resource To Assist You Best In Effortlessly Manifesting: A simple tool to manifest your desires, be in vibrational alignment with what you want, release subconscious limiting beliefs, and unleash your manifesting power within -- all by just pushing Play. Get instant access to watch the video here &gt;&gt;&gt;", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/metaphysical/manifesting-and-law-of-attraction-why-hard-work-is-not-necessary-and-is-counterproductive.html"},

The first act of developing creation is the source multiplying into doubles. From mono into dual then triad. The mono division into masculine, and feminine energies. In a rule of magnesium opposites attract; therefore, masculine, and feminine energies will always try to merge back to mono.This was the beginning of energetic coupling. These energies personify within creation as male, and female genders. These two genders magnetically attract. Having a portion of soul does not mean that a person has a soul mate. Soul or sol for solar is the inner light or sun within that is generated by the inner spiritual heart.A mate is a match between two individual beings. This mating is from the process of relating by lifetime experiences. True love in its raw form generates from the reservoir of unconditional compassion of the inner spiritual heart. Love can not be contained. Love can not be measured. Love is not possession. Love is not the desires from lust. Love is not enacted by a ritual.True love which is divine love is enacted by the connection with the source of all creation.  Nothing belongs to anyone except the source of all creation.  So a being can not give themselves to a man or woman. A being can only share themselves. The sharing of true love is the best gift a being can share with another. The sharing of spiritual energies by intimacy will cause a bond at the spiritual core of the heart. This is what many are calling love. This is the spiritual reaction that cause many to use the phrase 'I'm in love'.The sharing of seminal fluid will cause a genetic connection with that being's genetic line. Measuring a being's love by finance, possessions, or material gains is not real love. For real love is a spiritual essence not physical. Women have forgotten how to truly love. They now only lust for power, control, and material value. Men have forgotten how to care. They are more physical as protectors. So they have less compassion. But men have become possessed by sex forces.But both genders are being controlled by artificial means. Money or currency, and drugs.The only way to redemption is the expression of divine love, and the practice of divine peace. The way to gain those attributes is by re-connecting with the source of all creation. The way to re-connect is by way of divine enlightenment. Divine love is caring about all creation. This expression will cause a change of heart. Then with that cause an effect of peace would permeate throughout the world.  A start of self love will begin the process of transformation.  The re-education with divine intelligence will reform the thought process to reach divine enlightenment.Each person can start the process of saving the world. Live in peace, express divine love, and dwell in happiness.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/metaphysical/divine-love-a-power-that-saves.html"},
{"heading": "How To Get What You Want From Life – 5 Key Steps To Manifestation", "author": "Iona Kristina", "description": "Learn how to get what you want from life with these 5 essential key steps. This is the manifestation process simplified and narrowed down to consciously allow your desires into reality.", "word-count": 1428, "body": "For years, many people have talked about manifesting your desires and using the Law of Attraction, and there are numerous books on this subject, teaching about manifestation strategies and ways to attracting your desires into your life. After learning a lot about them and applying the principles bit by bit in my own life, this manifestation process can be simplified and narrowed down into 5 essential steps that you can use to consciously allow the things that you want in your life now.And I’ll be sharing each of them with you in this article, in the order presented below. So let's begin.STEP #1. KNOWING WHO YOU REALLY ARE: You Are A Powerful CreatorThe foundation for manifesting the life that you desire is first having the clear knowledge of who you are and what power you hold. More than knowing how the game of life is played, it is primarily about understanding the true nature of your being, the power that you have in creating your life, and the universal laws that govern this process of creation. It is important to know that:(1) Everything in life is energy, including you. You are made out of pure positive energy, the same powerful energy that created this entire Universe. It is moving in you, through you, and around you at all times. We all have access to this powerful energy stream that is capable of creating anything imaginable in this world.(2) You are a very powerful creator who directs this energy through the thoughts you think and emotions you feel on a daily basis. You are made in the image and likeness of this Universe, and because of this, you are already inherently powerful, unlimited, infinite, worthy, abundant, and grandly loved at your deepest core.(3) You are the sole creator of your experience because you are the only thinker in your mind and the feeler of your own emotions. The process of creation always starts in you. You are at the cause, and the things in your life are the effects. The thoughts you continuously think, the beliefs and perspectives that you hold about yourself and about life, and the emotions coming from within you, all determine what you attract and make real in your outside world.(4) Through the ever-consistent Universal law of attraction, life will always reflect back to you the dominant energies you’re sending out. You have the freedom to choose what energy you’re vibrating and therefore attracting, by choosing the kind of thoughts and emotions you habitually entertain. Your outside reality will always mirror your world within. You are the molder of your reality and the attractor of your circumstances.Applying this first step will allow you to be a conscious thinker and deliberate controller of your daily thoughts and emotions. This requires taking care of the seeds that you allow to grow in your mind and prioritizing the way you feel in any moment. You will now consciously direct your thinking towards the things that you want to attract in your life and let go of those that do not resonate with who you know yourself to be.STEP #2. TRUSTING YOURSELF AND THE POWERFUL LAWS: The Aligning Of Your EnergyThe second step is trusting yourself and your creative power, and trusting this consistent and accurate law of the Universe that says “what you put out is what you will get back”. Applying the second step means letting go of doubts, judgments, noises and unnecessary conclusions that go in the opposite direction of what you want, such as thoughts of things not working out in your life or that you must probably be doing something wrong. This habit will just put your energy towards unwanted things and will block the way for your desires coming true for you.Cultivating trust means being calm, keeping the faith, and being accepting of the present moment, knowing that things are always conspiring to bring you the best, and unseen forces of the Universe are working on your behalf. With trust, you are at peace and in harmony with situations and things as they occur, and you relinquish the need to judge them based on how they appear on the surface level. You know that the universal forces are at work and you are worthy of the good things coming. As a result, your energy will be in alignment with your desire, instead of moving in the opposite direction of doubt, fear and worry.STEP #3. SURRENDERING THE SPECIFIC DETAILS AND TIMING: Letting Go Of ControlThe third step of surrendering means knowing and trusting (step 1 &amp; 2) that you have already asked for what you want and planted the seeds of your desires, and they are growing and sprouting at its own perfect pace. There is a letting go of control, and of the need for struggle or stronger effort to make them grow, because already inherent in your every desire is the power for its fulfillment. It's already being done.Only after knowing and trusting will you be able to surrender to the higher Universal power. Surrendering is knowing that there is a perfect season for everything, and trusting that as long as you are aligned with the vision of what you want, the harvest time is inevitable. You are able to let go of the specific details as to how, when, where and who. There is no insistence on a particular outcome or manner, not needing or demanding specific expectations, and remaining in the general state and knowing that it is for sure and coming.This step of surrendering to the perfect timing of things will enable you to appreciate every step of the unfolding of your journey, and remove the impatience and the “should haves” because you recognize that everything is part of the success and learnings along your trail. This allows you to be light and easy as you let the Universe handle the details for its fulfillment.STEP #4. ACTING, PREPARING AND GETTING READY: Being Available And ExpectingThe fourth step is now making yourself available for the impulses and inspiration that will guide you towards the things you want, as you move in the general direction of your desires. Once you have surrendered the details, you are now in this open state of taking inspired baby steps to flow with the energy momentum, and to increase the anticipation for your desire.Baby steps can include visualizations, scripting or imagining how it would feel like being already inside your desire. This can also include acting on the inspiration- perhaps to go to a certain place, talk to a certain person, join this particular organization, sign up for a certain event, and so on. You are continuously doing what feels good from where you are, while simultaneously letting go of attachment to specific outcomes. You are doing your best, and allowing the Universe to take care of the rest. You are in a place of general expectation of the coming of your desires. You do not know the specifics yet, but you definitely know that it is coming. This allows you to be pointed and flowing in the direction of what you want, and ready to be the receiver of the specific details of its unfolding. There will be no vibration of something missing or lacking in your life, because acting on the baby steps allow for the energy to be moving through you as you go along.STEP #5. RECEIVING YOUR DESIRES: Feeling Appreciation For The Unfolding And Being Joyful Where You AreThe fifth and last step is being the Conscious Witness and Receiver of the wonderful unfolding of what you want, piece by piece and little by little in your life. This means being in a state of satisfaction and gratitude as each day unfolds, and being the joyful realizer of what you desire.Receiving means continuously feeling good and letting your vibration remain in that frequency, as the things you asked for gently and easily flow into your experience. This is ultimately understanding that the way you feel now is creating the atmosphere of your future experiences. It is the present moment feeling that you’re attracting more of. Receiving your desires is deliberately and consciously tending to your inner world first, and then letting the world outside you reflect what you have inside.If you would like to discover this 1 simple tool to easily and effortlessly clear out limiting beliefs that keep you from manifesting what you want, you can check out this special video presentation here: https://manifestingtools.com and see how aligning your energies can be easily done, starting in the next 24 hours.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/metaphysical/how-to-get-what-you-want-from-life-5-key-steps-to-manifestation.html"},

{"heading": "Book Summary Of Mike Dooley's Playing The Matrix: How To Make The Universe Work In Your Favor", "author": "Iona Kristina", "description": "In this article, I will be sharing 8 key points or takeaways from the book Playing The Matrix by Mike Dooley. You will discover ways on how to be within reach of Universal magic, and allow the unlimited help and assistance that you always have in manifesting your desires.", "word-count": 1350, "body": "A very informative and empowering book, Playing The Matrix by Mike Dooley talks in detail about the right action steps to take and the right attitude to have to easily and consciously create and manifest your desires in life – a guideline presented in a grid or matrix form that you can easily play out with. It teaches about the process on how to be within reach of Universal magic, and allow the unlimited help and assistance that you always have. In this article, I’m sharing with you 8 things I learned after reading the book. Mike Dooley is one of my favorite authors on topics about law of attraction, awakening and enlightenment, and it is my pleasure to share these key points with you.1. The key is to focus on generating the happy feelings associated with your desires, rather than getting too specific and attaching to details as to how they will happen.When you become more general about your goals and desires, you remove the tendency for doubting and resistance. By going after the feeling and doing things that make you feel happy and satisfied, with or without direct connection to your desires, you will allow the Universe to have more leeway in orchestrating the best path to give you what you want. Instead of constantly trying to figure everything out and “messing with the cursed hows”, as how Mike Dooley puts it in his book, you leave the details to the hands of the Universe while you take care of maintaining the general feelings of happiness, satisfaction, trust and appreciation. You match your own inner energy with the energy of your desires so that the specific details can easily flow into your experience. 2. Release the tendency to judge things and events in your life based on physical appearances.Being in a reality where there is the concept of time and space, there will be things, events, and people that need to be in alignment first before you can see tangible evidence of your desires moving for you. Even though sometimes, life seems to be working for others and not you, always know that the Universe is working tirelessly in your favor. There are significant movements in your life in the unseen, which in time will make its way into the visible. In a world where there are billions of co-creators, there is a perfect timing involved in the matching up of cooperative components. Keeping the faith and having patience as you continuously hold the vision and certainty of your desires are the key traits to maintaining alignment until they manifest. 3. What you’re thinking and how you’re feeling right now is what you are saying to the Universe as “give me more of this please”.Thoughts becoming things is the central concept in all of Mike Dooley’s books. All the thoughts you are thinking are sending energy vibrations to the Universe and are continuously gathering more similar energies toward it. Your thoughts are essentially like energetic invitations you send out to the Universe that will eventually attract into your life more of the same. These energies come back to you in the form of experiences that will generate the same feeling you’ve been sending out. That’s why taking care of the thoughts you habitually entertain in your mind is of paramount importance in creating pleasing manifestations in your life. You will always get more of the things you dwell upon, think, or talk about to others. 4. Keeping an open perspective as to how your desires will come about will release insistence on any specific detail. Knowing that there are many doors and pathways that are available to you to get to where you say you want to go will release the tendency to be frustrated on any one door closing or any pathway being unavailable at the moment. Always remember that what your physical mind can think of right now is just one way, among hundreds of ways, that the Universe can orchestrate for you. Knowing this will remove unnecessary insistence and attachment to any particular happening in your life because there will always be another one coming that will be a better match for what you want. There is no end to the good things that can come to you so you can start letting go of any scarcity mindset that you may have regarding your desires. 5. Taking steps toward what you want communicates your faith and belief in yourself and in your desires.Mike Dooley has stated many times in his book how important it is to keep on “knocking on doors and turning over stones”, as he emphasized keeping yourself moving in the direction of what you want. It doesn’t matter how small the step is, as long as you are making yourself available to the Universe by taking small actions or baby steps that feel good to you, you are allowing yourself to be an easy reach to the infinite magic of life. Start doing the things you can do, with what you currently have from wherever you are in life right now. 6. You are already worthy, blessed and loved as you are, forevermore.Realize that anything that is happening in your life is just a temporary event that passes through you, without any effect on who you truly are. You are a divine being who is naturally inclined for joy, success, love and happiness. These are your default settings. You are more than your circumstances or the events that are happening in your life, which are what Mike Dooley called “illusions of reality”. You are greater and bigger than the illusions that the circumstances might represent.Always remembering this will help you move past the temporary contradictions you may encounter along your path, and continue moving forward with confidence, peace and stability in knowing who you really are. Being stable in these feelings of worthiness and blessedness will serve as your solid foundation for allowing all of the specific details of your desires to come easily to you, giving you even more proof of how worthy and loved you truly are. 7. All challenges are gifts that present themselves to you to help you grow and become more than you were before.All the things that you see as problems are actually stepping stones to move higher in your evolution in life. It allows you to learn and remember things that you will eventually need in order to get to where you want to be in the future. And when you make it a perspective to always see challenges as opportunities to better yourself and become more ready, you cultivate optimism and trust which are essential traits that will allow the improvements in your life faster and will eliminate holding out your desires. You will be clearing the way for your own manifestations and making the best of wherever you are. 8. Today is the best time of your life.Realizing the joy of being where you are now will pave the way for an even better tomorrow. As you continue having a grateful attitude to the things that are currently working in your life, big or small, and as you feel satisfied moving in the direction of your still unfulfilled desires, then you are in the perfect place to be in right now for pleasing manifestations to occur. The state of incompletion is how being in this life is. It is natural and normal to always be reaching for something more because this is how the Universe continuously expands itself. Stay at peace with being perfectly unfinished and realized how blessed you are now in this moment of your life.P.S.

Individually, we understand and hope that companies begin to tap in, acknowledge and support the importance of wellbeing in the workplace.", "word-count": 573, "body": "I know it may sound cliché but the mind is really a terrible thing to waste. No one person is exempt from experiencing a mental health challenge. Frequently, we take on life stressors, and our mental capacity is forced to deal with the gravity of all the responsibilities at work.There are many variables that can take our mental health balance off track – such as an untimely death in the family, an abusive relationship or work environment, responsibilities of being a student and parent at the same time are just a few examples. Regardless of the events or situations that throw us off track, finding a navigation system that re-directs you back to a healthy function is critical.  By definition, mental health is the level of emotional, psychological, and social well-being – the absence of mental dysfunction, or the state of someone operating at an acceptable level of emotional and behavioral adjustment.Our mental stability determines how we think, feel, and act – as it relays to stress, connections with others and decision making. At every phase of life - from infancy, to puberty and old age, mental health is extremely significant. As we experience mental health problems throughout the development of our lives, our thinking, mood, and behavior are molded and shaped by those moments.BALANCING MENTAL HEALTHResearch shows that how you think about yourself can have a powerful effect on how you feel. It is important that we make time to partialize work priorities and personal development to increase your mental health.If you are one who has a strong family and/or social connection then you generally, are more likely to have healthier responses to mental health dysfunction.  However, if you lack a support network, you must make it your priority to plan and establish supportive friends or engage in events where you can encounter new people, such as a club, class or support group.There is a saying that goes “In order to get a different result, you must be willing to do something different.” In other words, being able to change or re-write the narrative of events, settings or situations that burdens your mental health is extremely significant. Our habits give us feelings of security and safety, a little modification can be beneficial in a monotonous work setting.Alter your workspace with positive quotes, plan a meeting with your superior about your concerns, take a walk and get out the office on your lunch break, or hang some motivational pictures up. Decide what you want to achieve both professionally and personally, and document a list of the steps you need for your goals to come to fruition. Set the bar you want, but be realistic and don't over-schedule nor over-compensate. With this approach, you’ll relish a great sense of success and self-worth as you make steps toward your goal. Asking for feedback from your supervisor can help you stay on track.  STRESS MANAGEMENTGetting assistance is not a weakness— but a sign of strength. And it is important to remember that getting help is extremely effective for addressing any mental health challenges. Those who get suitable attention can improve and lead full, rewarding careers. Inescapably, stress is a fragment of life. Have the ability to practice good coping skills is important. Research shows that laughter can lift your immune system, comfort discomfort, relax anxiety, and reduce stress. Also, remember to show your infectious smile and try to see the humor in the burdens of life.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/motivational/mental-health-and-your-career.html"},

{"heading": "How To Get What You Want From Life: 5 Key Steps To Manifesting And Law Of Attraction", "author": "Iona Kristina", "description": "In this article are the 5 essential steps in the manifestation process using the law of attraction. These steps will help in establishing the vibration of allowing within you, so you can become more receptive to what you want.", "word-count": 1427, "body": "For years, many people have talked about manifesting your desires and using the Law of Attraction, and there are numerous books on this subject, teaching about manifestation strategies and ways to attracting your desires into your life. After learning a lot about them and applying the principles bit by bit in my own life, this manifestation process can be simplified and narrowed down into 5 essential steps that you can use to consciously allow the things that you want in your life now.And I’ll be sharing each of them with you in this article, in the order presented below. So let's begin.STEP #1. KNOWING WHO YOU REALLY ARE: You Are A Powerful CreatorThe foundation for manifesting the life that you desire is first having the clear knowledge of who you are and what power you hold. More than knowing how the game of life is played, it is primarily about understanding the true nature of your being, the power that you have in creating your life, and the universal laws that govern this process of creation. It is important to know that:(1) Everything in life is energy, including you. You are made out of pure positive energy, the same powerful energy that created this entire Universe. It is moving in you, through you, and around you at all times. We all have access to this powerful energy stream that is capable of creating anything imaginable in this world.(2) You are a very powerful creator who directs this energy through the thoughts you think and emotions you feel on a daily basis. You are made in the image and likeness of this Universe, and because of this, you are already inherently powerful, unlimited, infinite, worthy, abundant, and grandly loved at your deepest core.(3) You are the sole creator of your experience because you are the only thinker in your mind and the feeler of your own emotions. The process of creation always starts in you. You are at the cause, and the things in your life are the effects. The thoughts you continuously think, the beliefs and perspectives that you hold about yourself and about life, and the emotions coming from within you, all determine what you attract and make real in your outside world.(4) Through the ever-consistent Universal law of attraction, life will always reflect back to you the dominant energies you’re sending out. You have the freedom to choose what energy you’re vibrating and therefore attracting, by choosing the kind of thoughts and emotions you habitually entertain. Your outside reality will always mirror your world within. You are the molder of your reality and the attractor of your circumstances.Applying this first step will allow you to be a conscious thinker and deliberate controller of your daily thoughts and emotions. This requires taking care of the seeds that you allow to grow in your mind and prioritizing the way you feel in any moment. You will now consciously direct your thinking towards the things that you want to attract in your life and let go of those that do not resonate with who you know yourself to be.STEP #2. TRUSTING YOURSELF AND THE POWERFUL LAWS: The Aligning Of Your EnergyThe second step is trusting yourself and your creative power, and trusting this consistent and accurate law of the Universe that says “what you put out is what you will get back”. Applying the second step means letting go of doubts, judgments, noises and unnecessary conclusions that go in the opposite direction of what you want, such as thoughts of things not working out in your life or that you must probably be doing something wrong. This habit will just put your energy towards unwanted things and will block the way for your desires coming true for you.Cultivating trust means being calm, keeping the faith, and being accepting of the present moment, knowing that things are always conspiring to bring you the best, and unseen forces of the Universe are working on your behalf. With trust, you are at peace and in harmony with situations and things as they occur, and you relinquish the need to judge them based on how they appear on the surface level. You know that the universal forces are at work and you are worthy of the good things coming. As a result, your energy will be in alignment with your desire, instead of moving in the opposite direction of doubt, fear and worry.STEP #3. SURRENDERING THE SPECIFIC DETAILS AND TIMING: Letting Go Of ControlThe third step of surrendering means knowing and trusting (step 1 &amp; 2) that you have already asked for what you want and planted the seeds of your desires, and they are growing and sprouting at its own perfect pace. There is a letting go of control, and of the need for struggle or stronger effort to make them grow, because already inherent in your every desire is the power for its fulfillment. It's already being done.Only after knowing and trusting will you be able to surrender to the higher Universal power. Surrendering is knowing that there is a perfect season for everything, and trusting that as long as you are aligned with the vision of what you want, the harvest time is inevitable. You are able to let go of the specific details as to how, when, where and who. There is no insistence on a particular outcome or manner, not needing or demanding specific expectations, and remaining in the general state and knowing that it is for sure and coming.This step of surrendering to the perfect timing of things will enable you to appreciate every step of the unfolding of your journey, and remove the impatience and the “should haves” because you recognize that everything is part of the success and learnings along your trail. This allows you to be light and easy as you let the Universe handle the details for its fulfillment.STEP #4. ACTING, PREPARING AND GETTING READY: Being Available And ExpectingThe fourth step is now making yourself available for the impulses and inspiration that will guide you towards the things you want, as you move in the general direction of your desires. Once you have surrendered the details, you are now in this open state of taking inspired baby steps to flow with the energy momentum, and to increase the anticipation for your desire.Baby steps can include visualizations, scripting or imagining how it would feel like being already inside your desire. This can also include acting on the inspiration- perhaps to go to a certain place, talk to a certain person, join this particular organization, sign up for a certain event, and so on. You are continuously doing what feels good from where you are, while simultaneously letting go of attachment to specific outcomes. You are doing your best, and allowing the Universe to take care of the rest. You are in a place of general expectation of the coming of your desires. You do not know the specifics yet, but you definitely know that it is coming. This allows you to be pointed and flowing in the direction of what you want, and ready to be the receiver of the specific details of its unfolding. There will be no vibration of something missing or lacking in your life, because acting on the baby steps allow for the energy to be moving through you as you go along.STEP #5. RECEIVING YOUR DESIRES: Feeling Appreciation For The Unfolding And Being Joyful Where You AreThe fifth and last step is being the Conscious Witness and Receiver of the wonderful unfolding of what you want, piece by piece and little by little in your life. This means being in a state of satisfaction and gratitude as each day unfolds, and being the joyful realizer of what you desire.Receiving means continuously feeling good and letting your vibration remain in that frequency, as the things you asked for gently and easily flow into your experience. This is ultimately understanding that the way you feel now is creating the atmosphere of your future experiences. It is the present moment feeling that you’re attracting more of. Receiving your desires is deliberately and consciously tending to your inner world first, and then letting the world outside you reflect what you have inside.If you would like to discover this 1 simple tool to easily and effortlessly clear out limiting beliefs that keep you from manifesting what you want, you can check out this special video presentation here:  and see how aligning your energies can be easily done, starting in the next 24 hours.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/metaphysical/how-to-get-what-you-want-from-life-5-key-steps-to-manifesting-and-law-of-attraction.html"},

In my neighborhood, there’s a Japanese restaurant that he’s obsessed with and he loves their food.In fact, he loves their food so much and visits the restaurant so often that the entire staff pretty much knows who he is.He even met a famous Japanese tea master at the restaurant and was invited to attend one of his tea ceremonies.What’s a tea ceremony you might be wondering?It’s a special ritual where tea masters prepare and serve the green tea known as Matcha.However, it’s not as simple as I made it sound. For the tea masters, there’s a whole choreography they have to perfect and it requires a lot of discipline.When my friend told me about all this, I asked him what the significance of the ceremony is.To summarize what he told me:The significance has to do with the concept of “Wabi-Sabi.”Wabi-Sabi is the art of finding beauty in imperfection and accepting the natural cycle of life and death.Finding beauty in imperfection, is something that, I think we can both agree on, a lot of people struggle with. But once we find it, our lives become so much easier.We want things to be perfect. But as wishful thinking as it is, things won’t always turn out that way. Achieving perfection, although it does make us work harder in some cases, also holds us back too.In fact, it’s one of the causes of procrastination.Master marketer, Justin Goff, admits to this in an email he sent to his list yesterday. He fell two weeks behind on a huge project because he wanted it to be perfect.It happens to me too when I need to write.Our solution?Start with a small task.In the case of writing emails, write one sentence. Then continue doing small tasks until you get into the groove and snowball through.But you still have to make sure you’re writing good emails though, which you can learn by reading 'How to Become an Email Titan.'", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/motivational/finding-beauty-in-imperfection.html"},

{"heading": "Corona Virus – The Untold Story & The Hidden Secrets…!!", "author": "Mohammed Rafi", "description": "The virus is probably wondering how! despite its terrifying demeanor, it has been reduced to an object of ridicule, by taking the centre stage on the most prevalent channel of communication – Memes!!", "word-count": 1645, "body": "Although the latest celebrity, COVID-19 virus has been doing a luxurious world tour, a greater number of the population is getting creative and spreading humor around, at the expense of the virus.And clearly, medical scientists across the world are working on getting it to chill! By tranquilizing it and tricking it into its own death. But our bro Corona seems like he is quite the player, ain’t he? Could it be because he has an untold story and some hidden secrets? Interesting, isn’t it? Let’s read on to dig deeper…Despite being the object of ridicule, Corona bro did not lose state or give up! He reframed the situation and began considering his mockers as supporters who composed songs and slogans in his praise, and has been feeling all the more geared up to continue with his rampant invasions!So this got me thinking… If a mere, microscopic virus with no brains whatsoever could reframe its situations and overcome its hurdles and find joy in attacking so many people, then why can’t the much more complex organisms such as us, humans, reframe this battle, alleviate the panic, and get the best of it?Let’s face it. Until our Corona bro decides to take a chill pill and go back home from his vacation, there is not much we can do about it. Rather than panicking and buying humongous , groceries and other necessities, leaving none for those who cannot really afford to buy so much at one go, we could all try to reframe the situation and derive some joy out of it.Now how can we reframe this extremely nail-biting situation prevalent across the globe? To tell you how, and make it absolutely authentic, I spoke to some of my dearest friends and understood how they have been reframing this entire situation work to make the better of it.Ofcourse, safety and sanitization is a priority and so many people have already spoken at length about that but this blog post will focus more on how the onset of our Corona bro has given us all an opportunity to reconnect with our ancient traditions, families and ourselves.So let me just cut to the chase and tell you how this whole Corona situation has been reframed in real life by real people and the 5 different lessons I learnt from them, which happened to be the crux of the untold story of our Corona bro, showcasing his secretive, benevolent side:The onset of our Corona bro has given us a unique opportunity to live off of only the most vital things and to take our focus off of the unnecessary ones. Cost cutting, reduced pollution, reduced need to interact with unwanted people on a daily basis! You name it and we have it!In one of my recent conversations with Achla Bhardwaj, she happened to mention to me how her family was coping with the impending threat of our Corona bro taking a relaxed tour of the capital city of the nation.Although Achla and my other friend Dhanya Satish, were gearing up to face the contingency, they avoided buying unnecessary things that could hoard their spaces and bills, for instance, new furniture or clothes. Learning to survive on what they had at hand and channeling their money to stock up only the extremely essential food supplies and medicines to last them for a couple of months.My friends also told me how the Corona situation had limited their outdoor trips. This in fact had helped them save on the fuel costs, and offer their minuscule contribution to lowering the pollution rates in their respective cities!Imagine how much you would be saving by not taking your family or yourself to visit a mall or restaurants or the movies for a couple of months!From wanting to always eat out or order in, most people have withdrawn and gladly settled for fresh home-cooked food. Corona bro has ensured that we eat healthy ghar ka khana and feel nourished and ready to battle him if at all he knocks on our doors.This entire situation has given us all a chance to pay more attention to our homes and the resources we get out of it, which we normally tend to overlook or take for granted on other days.Some of my friends have taken to working from home whilst some are busy working at home, decluttering their spaces, wardrobes and cupboards! For instance, I saw Deepika Padukone’s new post on instagram about how she was utilizing her time at home to clean and clear out her cupboards. (You see, she is a good friend of mine but she doesn’t know I exist. At least, not yet.)Dhanya was sharing her experience on how she has been experimenting with different cuisines to attract her children’s palates, and this had also given her an opportunity to let her daughters invite a couple of their friends over for hi-tea, all the while studying their group dynamics even better.The kids had also been contributing in the household chores and learning to take up ownership and responsibilities in keeping their homes clean and healthy.My mother has also been busy throwing out most of my stuff during this period (God knows, when she decides to throw me out!), while she has also been revamping her garden, fostering little birds and their babies, all to make her home, a sweet home.And I just sit back, eat healthy food and enjoy the view!I would personally say that this period of isolation or social distancing has been a great way to unleash one’s creativity! Be it playing with your kids or writing a movie or designing online courses!I remember Nikhil Damle, another good friend of mine, sharing a picture of his 8 year-old son, Aalhad Damle, dressed as Iron Man, with a suit made of only cardboard boxes! And I remembered how he narrated this whole incident of him playing along with his son and having so much fun in the process!Dhanya was also sharing her child-like joy at getting to learn so many new games and playing them with her little ones every day. She had also been involved in making candles and designing creative artwork with her daughters.Our very own Mohammad Rafi, came up with quite a few peak performance exercises for young children and helped his daughter practise the same! From sitting along with her for painting and coloring to devising new games to entertain her and keep her active, Rafi has managed to add some novel ideas to his bucket!Achla also happened to mention that she had encouraged her children to take up online tuitions and lessons till the situation became better, thereby getting them to make better use of the technological resources rather than mere unresourceful gadget addiction..This is something I do religiously, not just on days where Corona bro is pole-dancing but even otherwise. But this is quite a luxury for many people, I must say. Especially those who have no break from their routine work-life.My best friend, Darshana Irwin, who is a dentist by profession, had been working literally all days of the week since before. The moment Corona bro decided to arrive unannounced, she got her much deserved break and she spent it in the most resourceful way ever! Eating, sleeping, binge watching movies on repeat mode!!You don’t need to worry about dressing up for parties or social gatherings for which you were probably looking for reasons to avoid going! Well thank our Corona bro for not inviting you to his party!This is the time that you can devote for yourself to just RELAX your mind, body and soul!! So why panic and fret about not being able to step out or kiss your partner when you have better things to do. Imagine relishing great food, sleeping into the late hours of the day, pampering yourself by lying on your bed and watching great movies! It sounds good, doesn’t it?There have been a number of people who have been calling to check in on me and have been making sure that we are all safe and healthy. This has helped me nurture my bonds with the people in my life and to show them empathy and compassion. This has also given me an opportunity to reconnect with some very special people who I had lost touch with over the years!My dad decided to turn the tense scenario around by resuming his guitar sessions after a long time, and he even sang along his favorite Tamil song to me – , the song he would play on his guitar to put me to sleep when I was a little child.My mom made her signature sweet dish – , which carried the impeccable taste of my childhood and we three had memorable nights sitting around with each other and talking our hearts out!Moreover, this situation has also enabled me to identify the various activities that I could do to keep my spirits up and stay positive in my life. I have been working on getting back to my singing, reading and writing more and being more health-conscious. This way I have been able to reconnect with myself too!So my dear friends, I know Corona bro can be a scary dude. But there isn’t much we can do other than taking precautions to prevent his rampant spread. But we sure can do plenty to reframe our mind into making the best of this situation! So this season of Corona, take time off to enjoy your work-from home luxuries, unleash your true creative potential, cherish the moments with your loved ones, make memories, eat healthy food and take care of yourself and the people around you!And when this situation dies down for good, remember to never take even the smallest things in your lives for granted. Be more grateful and spread more joy and love, and ofcourse this untold story of our Corona bro!", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/motivational/corona-virus-the-untold-story-the-hidden-secrets.html"},

McKinsey and Company, Deliotte, Association Talent Development (formerly ASTD) and Society of Human Resource Management (SHRM) have conducted countless survey that have touched hundreds-of-thousands of professionals in understanding best practices of leadership that works. All reinforce what the other has found, and that success trajectories are born from models of excellence. The same is true to crafting the trajectory to personal achievement and sustained success, it starts with a proven blueprint.Whether working with a start-up entrepreneurial individual or entrepreneurialbusiness or the implications with an existing billion dollar entity, this blueprint has been validated. It begins with the key stakeholders within an organization only, as they either validate the five factors or revalidate the five factors if it is an existing entity. The same blueprint holds true for an individual’s trajectory for success and the attainment to their aspirations. Think of these five factors as five interlinked sequential words: Intent is driven from and must be consistent with the foundational VALUES of the key stakeholder(s) or organization. Strategy borne from the Values that key-stakeholders or organization operates from, drives the Vision and trajectory individuals are willing to commit to and execute. It illuminates everything one is willing to commit to, believe in, tolerate and conversely what one will not commit to, believe in or tolerate.  drives from a macro level everything that comes next. It serves as a starting point and check-point to benchmark everything you do next and ensures that what you do next is in alignment with the Strategic Intent or not. Factor Two Operational Administrative Implications speaks to the sequential needs, systems, procedures, processes, technology, protocols, SOPS, etc., that must be designed, understood, embraced, implemented, and utilized to execute the Strategic Intent/Strategy. As you evaluate the organizational realities, resources, abilities, capabilities, human capital, and resolve for implementation the operational needs will become apparent. The skill and training pipeline needs will be apparent. The rhythm can be set and calibrated against existing best practice doctrine to exceed goals and needs. Factor Three Tactical/Behavior Implementation, address the actual human capital and technology execution standards. It drives the actual behaviors to performance expectations, how these are monitored, measured, calibrated, feedback provided, standards adhered to and best practices to exceed expectations under budget and above quality expectations. Very Jeff Magee, PhD, PDM, CSP, CMC, the “Thought Leader’s Leader.” Jeff is the publisher of Performance 360 Magazine, Editor of Trajectory Code and Performance Driven Selling blogs, a former nationally syndicated Radio Talk Show Host as well as a published author of several books including Performance Execution, The Managerial Leadership Bible, The Sales Training Handbook, and Your Trajectory Code.

While these three are the initial blueprint foundational requirements for success, I have also found that the following two factors are critical and if not adhered to by the organization, reinforced constructively by culture, and embraced individually as a personal “code-of-ethics” these will impede success and can also lead to complete implosion. Factor Four Discipline Execution, speaks simply to the adherence to doing what must be done at the time it must be done mentality, no excuses or blame for low performance!

In implementing these five factors within an organization or from a personal level, these five factors should be respectful of ones’ history (not naive), and be reflective of the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) necessary to ensure that the Immediate, Intermediate, Long Term needs (goals, objectives) are being met to remain relevant for both today and tomorrow!", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/motivational/5-factors-to-organizational-personal-success.html"},
{"heading": "How To Make The Law Of Attraction Work Every Time: 7 Easy Techniques", "author": "Iona Kristina", "description": "Discover 7 easy manifestation techniques you can apply in your daily life. Learn how to make the law of attraction work every time by consistently matching up your energetic offering to the things that you’ve asked for.", "word-count": 1582, "body": "Manifesting your desires is all about matching your current thoughts and feelings with the energy of what you want. And these law of attraction manifestation techniques detailed below can serve as tools, processes and exercises that can assist you in making the law of attraction work and in matching up your energetic offering to the things that you’ve asked for.All the things that you desire are vibrating at the energy frequency of happiness, joy, love, peace, harmony, excitement, passion, certainty, and satisfaction. And these techniques are geared towards conjuring up these emotions from within you. When practiced regularly, these will help raise your frequency to the level that will allow the things you desire to easily flow into your physical reality.Lets begin.Law of attraction technique #1: Gratitude RampageThis exercise is about making a detailed list of all the things you feel grateful for in your life right now. The purpose is to have a free flow of anything that you appreciate and feel blessed to have, which can include the simplest things such as the air you’re breathing now, your sense of sight, the beautiful weather outside, the clean water you have access to, and so on. You can make the list as long as your thoughts will allow, in order to feel the abundance of blessings that you currently have. You can do this even while you’re in the shower, or while you’re outside going to work. You can do as you wake up in the morning, before you sleep at night, or any time in between. Make a list on paper, on your phone, or even just in your mind.The important thing is that your focus is toward the feeling of appreciation and thankfulness in the moment. This will make you notice all the little things we usually take for granted, and will add a feeling of blessedness and satisfaction with your present moment. You will begin shifting your focus toward the things that you love and enjoy, instead of the things that are lacking or missing.Include people and experiences, tangible and intangible, big or small. Enjoy listing all of the wonderful blessings you appreciate in your life.Law of attraction technique #2: Your Universal Request EnvelopeThis technique involves setting aside a container, which can be an envelope, folder, or box, where you’ll store words or pictures of the things you are asking the Universe to deliver to you. The purpose of this exercise is to be creative and playful in sending your requests to the Universe, and subsequently feeling the satisfying relief of having a Universal “genie” receiving and granting all of your wishes.You can write down the things that you want or you can cut out pictures that represent your desire. And one by one you place them inside the container, envelope or box, while saying your intention — “Universe, deliver to me this thing that I desire, or something better, in whatever manner you consider best for me. Thank you”.As you do, feel the ease and lightness of having surrendered your desire to the Universe, and cultivate the trust and peace of mind that it will surely be delivered in the right way and timing for you. This is meant to be a playful exercise, and you can be creative in what you put inside your container. You can continuously do this whenever you find a photo of something you desire. Just put it inside the container, and leave the fulfillment part of the process to your Universal genie.Law of attraction technique #3: Milking The FeelingThis manifestation technique is about deliberately staying longer in the vibration and frequency of a high energy feeling whenever you’re feeling good about something. This is done by asking yourself the question, “why do I feel good now?” or “why is this pleasing for me?”. As you ask yourself this question, your mind gets focused on the reasons why a certain thing, person or circumstance feel good to you, and you’ll be amplifying that feeling in your energy.You will be milking the feeling for every bit of good emotion that you can get out of it, and doing it consciously, so you’ll practice yourself in that vibration more and more. Rather than your mind wandering on all sorts of things, you will be more conscious in focusing longer on something that you like instead.This will increase the momentum of good energy in your life, and thereby attract more similar feelings to you. You can write these feelings down, or just milk them in your thoughts whenever you’re on the bus, in the grocery, at the park, or at a restaurant. And as you make this a mental habit, you will soon realize, most of your daily thoughts now revolve around what you like about your life, instead of the things unwanted.Law of attraction technique #4: MeditationThis manifestation technique involves the quieting of the mind in order to release any resistant or contradictory thoughts that get in the way of raising your frequency to the level of your desires. As you are quieting the mind, your energy naturally becomes higher, at the level of joy, peace and satisfaction, because there will be no contradictory negative thoughts of worry, anger, fear, or doubt.In order to meditate and quiet the mind, you have to be in a comfortable position, either lying down or sitting in a chair. Choose to focus on something simple, something that won’t encourage thoughts to linger in your mind.This can be focusing on the ins and outs of your breathing,focusing on a certain sound in the room like a fan or air-conditioning, or repeating a mantra in your mind such as “I am bliss”. All of these can be effective in maintaining your focus on something that’s not resistant in nature, so as to allow your mind to be calm, relaxed, and steady in a non-resistant environment.This increases your attraction power, as you are becoming more allowing instead of resisting. In this moment of meditation and mindfulness, you are flowing with the energy of life instead of against it. You can do this as you wake up in the morning, or before going to bed at night, for about 15 to 20 minutes daily.Law of attraction technique #5: High Vibrational ActivitiesThis tool is about making time to do activities that make you feel happy and joyful as you do them. For instance, this can include jogging in the morning, walking your dog to the park, getting a message, reading a book, baking a cake, or listening to your favorite music. The purpose is to do as many of these high vibrational things as you can in a day.It means taking the time to pamper yourself and do the things that bring joy and happiness to you, deliberately. It’s training your vibrational frequency to be set on a high place, and become aware whenever your vibration dips. Whenever you are pleasing yourself and taking care of the way you feel, you are putting more positive energy in yourself, and thereby increasing the momentum of your positive attraction.Law of attraction technique #6: Present ScriptingThis process is about telling or scripting your own story in a way that you prefer it to be. It is becoming the writer for your own life, and creating a story in the present tense of how you want things to play out in your reality. You can start by asking yourself the question, “what does my ideal day look like?”. You can then make a script about your perfect day, telling it in the present tense, involving all your senses, and making it playful and fun.As you write it, feel the emotions as if you are living that ideal day right now. Be creative and imaginative as to how your day looks like, and fill in with as much detail as you would like. This process can be likened to visualization, but this one involves writing it down and allows you to be more vivid as you describe the experience in words.Law of attraction technique #7: Subconscious Mind ReprogrammingThis process of reprogramming the subconscious mind is all about releasing any self-sabotaging beliefs that have been implanted in the mind because of past childhood programming, and introducing new beliefs that are empowering and aligned with your true nature.This can be done in two ways. One is consciously immersing yourself daily with positive thoughts (through affirmations or reading positivity books and the like) until these thoughts become the dominant beliefs in your life. This will require a longer time of continuous immersion and repetition before the mind gets reprogrammed with these new positive beliefs.The second option for reprogramming is the faster, shortcut way to doing this. It is called brainwave entrainment, which is achieved by listening to a specific audio or sound that is at a certain high frequency required for reprogramming (called theta state), followed by crafted subliminal messages for new programming. This process will automatically fix the underlying issues in your thinking that are sabotaging every aspect of your life.If you would like to learn more about how subconscious mind reprogramming can help you in manifesting your desires in an easy and fast way, you can watch this special video here  explaining how it works.Hope these 7 manifestation techniques I’ve listed have been insightful and helpful for you. Continuously applying these processes day by day will surely raise your frequency level, one step at a time, and will make you a powerful attractor and manifestor of your deepest desires.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/metaphysical/how-to-make-the-law-of-attraction-work-every-time-7-easy-techniques.html"},
{"heading": "Lessons That Can Change Your Life", "author": "Priyanka K Jain", "description": "My article is completely based on the modern world and my life experiences. This is some life lessons which I personally learned:", "word-count": 1231, "body": "1) Money is everything: I saw people saying money is not much importance in life. But in reality, money is everything, you get respect because of money (Like rich people get) and you get disrespect because of money (Like poor people or beggars get). If you have money then you can live more days in this world, I mean if you have money doctors will try 100% to save you. I am putting this point with life experiences if someone says money is not everything then say him give some money for free. Then you understand this fact is true! 2) Only parents love is true and clean People always say that their love is true, and they love you so much. But in reality, everybody has some needs to fulfill that he/she wants from you. In most cases in the name of love, people fulfill their needs like money needs, sexual needs, and spending time. I share my life experience to explain why my fact is true. I was in college seen so many relationships, most of them are just for timepass and for experiencing sexual needs. I had one friend “Rahul” who was a good guy simple person. Rahul was in love with my friend “Pooja”. He told me about his love and he asked help from me to patch both them. I know he was a good person and he is loving her really. So I tried to find Pooja what type of boy as a boyfriend she expecting, she always used to say she needs a person who loves her and keeps her like a princess. One day Rahul proposed Pooja, guess what happened she said no. I mean what was this? Rahul was a good person he said he loves her, why she not given one chance to prove his love?? Then she was in a relationship with the cool guy of college, this experience shows me how true love is never appreciated. I know one incident not prove anything but maybe it does. If you start looking real world with open eyes you will see rich people marry only rich people. People only love good looking people. Why people never fall in love with beggers or weak people? Nowadays only parents do real love which not expect anything from their children. 3) Nothing and no one is permanent In our life, nothing can be permanent, today maybe it's your but tomorrow it will belong to someone else. It can be anything like any property or it can be any job position. You should never get more attached to something. Even in the case of a person, people change with time. One day your partner can leave you, and go away. So nothing in this life is permanent, if you are more attached to your partner then it will give you a problem after he leaves you. So be practical and accept the truth, accept the fact nothing is permanent. 4) Nobody cares  In this world, people act like they care about you. But the reality is nobody cares about someone else. Everyone is busy with their own problems, they don't have time to help someone. Accept the fact is nobody is here to help you. This is your life you have to live, this is your fight you have to fight. If any person dies, people cry for somedays after that they start living their life. Everyone is struggling for a comfortable life, you never see doctor care about patient then do treatment for free. Everyone is just living their life nobody care about anybody else this is a harsh reality. 6) Justice is not served all the time: In your life, I am sure you faced some situations where you blamed for something which was not your mistake. Yes, it happens with most people. People are sad and frustrated about they did not get justice. But the reality is justice not served all time. Even in courts, sometimes justice is not served to people. So sometimes, leave the matter and move on. 7) Nothing is more important in life Throughout our life, we spend time thinking about something which not worth your time. You start your day with the disappointment of yesterday and today you sleep with the disappointment of today. But is it worth your time, in reality, all things happening to you are not much important? People get tensed for losing winning but wait in the end you going to die nobody will remember you win or lose or you did this, etc. May some will remember you won or lose, but is it matter for you after your death. People always compare their life with successful people and get sad. But in the end, poor people or rich both will die. In ending you get nothing. A successful life is never is not about becoming rich or popular, successful life is the life in which you are really happy. So do what you want, life is really short you don't know when it will end. So try to live your life with happiness. 8) You have to help yourself nobody will help In your life you start solving your problems by yourself no one will always available to help you. Make yourself a person who not depend on others. Become independent and live independently until the end of your life. 9) Life will get better if people mind there own business There are so many problems are in life, but most of them never created if people start living their life instead of judging someone, pointing someone else. If every person lives life properly without giving problems to others. Then this life will get much better. 10) Fake people  You need to understand in your life you will meet so many people. But most of them not real, most of them pretend to care about you but they don't care about you. Most of them pretend to love you but they never did. Most of them smile in front of you but they want to see you crying. So you can't trust people with there smiles or behavior. Understand there are lot's of fake people, who hiding behind smile faces. Never trust people soon, take time to judge them, then come to a conclusion. 11) There is no Humanity A modern life gave us so many good things like freedom to live, freedom to talk, freedom to wear anything, equality to different genders. But there are some disadvantages it has one of then is less humanity. Nowadays people are updating and they live their life but don't want to help others. I tell you one incident which I personally saw, I saw a person who falls down on the road because of some health issues. I saw nobody was helping him, people were walking from the side of his body. After sometimes one person helped him and given him water, that guy opened his eyes all was fine. But this incident tells how from 100% of people only 5-10% of people have the humanity to help others. I think you accept this fact and understand how life is changing. All are these lessons I learned based on my life experiences. I will be happy to listen your opinion on these lessons also share your life-changing lessons which you learned on comments:)", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/motivational/lessons-that-can-change-your-life.html"},

While we haven’t seen verified models of the PS5 as of yet, an in-depth analysis of the console has been revealed.It’s been a mysterious journey, but here’s everything we know so far about the next generation of Sony console: welcome to the PS5.While the console is set to release later this year rumours and information have continued to whir around the internet at a rapidly increasing rate for the past few months.The PS5 was set for a major reveal on June 4 with Sony Interactive Entertainment chief Jim Ryan stating: “This digital showcase will run for a bit more than an hour and, for the first time, we will all be together virtually experiencing the excitement together.”If you read between the lines, that spells gameplay. This kind of reveal is fraught with danger, as Microsoft found out, incurring the wrath of gamers in their Xbox Series X gameplay reveal (seriously, ). In light of the recent events surrounding the death of George Floyd, however, Sony decided to pull the pin on this reveal until further notice.This (officially) only leaves us with the address on March 18. Mark Cerny, a leading systems architect at Sony, hosted a seminar during which he unveiled the ‘Road to PS5’. A somewhat unsatisfying 50-minute talk that went into immense detail about the console without revealing any virtual models or game engine footage.While it’s hardly as exhilarating as the Xbox Series X reveal, it nonetheless revealed a massive amount of detail about the hardware of the console.Primary Console Components:If this doesn’t mean anything to you, let me explain.Cerny basically boiled the lecture down to three main categories of the new console. Its Solid-State Drive (SSD), backwards compatibility, and 3D audio capabilities. Let’s dive into what these three developments actually mean for gamers.The PS5 will be able to produce marginally better graphics than its predecessor. Though the topic that’s up for debate is the load times. In the live stream, Cerny said that the PS4s internal hard drive can optimally load 1GB of data every 7 seconds. However, once you take seek times into consideration among other things this can often reach 20-30 seconds, resulting in longer load screens.According to Cerny, the solution is to implement the power of SSDs, which are now quite common and able to load 5.5GB a second. Cerny then envisages a world where developers will have to artificially increase wait times for respawns, fast travel and loading screens to prevent the game from moving too fast for the player.As for the hard-drive, the PS5 will launch with 825GB of space. Although options to replace the SSD for third-party models are possible, they will not be available at launch.The speed of said SSD is crucial to how well the PS5 will run at launch and, ultimately, how powerful the game’s graphics are. As of yet, the most powerful SSDs on the market can only transfer data at a rate of 3GB per second. Though Cerny believes this will be at 7GB per second by the year’s end.Another touchstone of Cerny’s lecture was the concept of balancing ‘evolution and revolution’. In layman’s terms, this means balancing backwards compatibility with modern features and higher efficiency.The PS5 will feature a custom Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) called the RDNA2 AMD GPU. To summarise, the PS5’s control unit (CU) will be 62% larger than the Ps4’s. This will ultimately mean it can route more processes more efficiently due to a larger amount of transistors present.The GPU will also be able to support the resource-intensive activity known as ray tracing and primitive shaders. This will largely prevent overheating and loud fan noise.As for backwards compatibility, the PS5 will be able to run almost every PS4 game from launch via regularised software algorithms. So don’t go selling old games if you’re looking to purchase a PS5, they may run even better now!One of the most thrilling and technically explicit aspects of the new PlayStation console is the introduction of 3D audio. During the interview, Cerny explained that a game screen refreshes between 60 and 120 times per second, while audio calculations occur roughly 200 times per second. Therefore, audio is an extremely crucial part of game development and one that has been somewhat overlooked in console development.PC headsets have featured 3D for a while now. However, the PS5 aims to deliver 3D audio on every platform: TV speakers, headset, and soundbar.To explain, 3D audio relies on Head-Related Transfer Function (HTRF). This technology maps an individual’s hearing based a sound’s direction, frequency and volume.If mapped out correctly in accordance with each person’s individual ear shape, HTRF will allow the user to hear as though it were happening all around them, rather than from a speaker. Pretty mind-blowing if you ask me.The new DualSense controller is markedly similar in design to the Dualshock 4. It will feature a new microphone as well as haptic feedback for a more immersive rumble.In demonstrations, Sony revealed how the controller could make the player feel the difference between tarmac and dirt in a racing game. Or splashing through the mud as opposed to sliding on ice in a platformer.Here’s how Sony Interactive Entertainment’s Senior Vice President of Platform, Planning and Management, Hideaki Nishino summed up the DualSense:“After thoughtful consideration, we decided to keep much of what gamers love about the DualShock 4 intact, while also adding new functionality and refining the design.”Refinement rather than revolution is the name of the game here. The DualShock 4 is an institution in its own right, so Sony didn’t stray too far from its classic design with the new DualSense.As of yet, no official design schematics have been revealed, however, a few sources have been leaked. Over at Gizmodo, folks were sent images of a supposed PS5 dev kit. The design is reportedly identical to the patent images that have been shared for months. While dev kits are notorious for being nothing like the final product in shape, this is the best indication we have for the final model.Even the rumoured look of the PS5 has had an evolution of its own, with the form factor at the in the image at the top of the article doing the rounds extensively.The PlayStation 5 is slated to launch in late 2020. Despite the disruptions to manufacturing, distribution and gaming showcases caused by COVID-19, the company is still committed to a holiday release. Microsoft may have taken the lead in terms of releasing information, but it seems more than unlikely that Sony would just let their American rivals dominate the crucial holiday period.The PS4 hit shelves on November 15, 2013, so we can expect Sony’s next-gen console to be everyone’s favourite Christmas present this year.

It doesn’t require any special equipment or equipment of any kind to start. There’s even a way to start with the less-crowded section of the physical world, which will eventually give way to more complicated applications.", "word-count": 665, "body": "The importance of mindfulness in the 21st century can’t be overstated, especially when it comes to increasing quality of life and physical health. Today, mindfulness has become an integral part of all modern workplaces. It’s even one of the more popular “try and get a job” exercise in our current economy, with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and founder of billion-dollar multi-billion dollar company, Elon Musk, being just two of the many chief executives who have made mindfulness a part of their practice.But just how are mindfulness practices supported by science?Benefits of MindfulnessWhile research on mindfulness is vast and rigorous and continues to evolve, there are many theories and stories behind the benefits of daily mindfulness practice. Yet, there is one specific factor that appears to be the most deeply rooted.According to some researchers, mindfulness practices support your ability to receive information from others. It should be noted that mindfulness instruction focuses on avoiding unhealthy thinking, the kind that is led by impulse and is fueled by difficulty with self-regulating.There are several treatments for anxiety in the past that have been cited for addressing this.The particular treatment, called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), was developed by psychiatrists Albert Ellis and Erich Fromm, a group of therapists who studied guided imagery, meditation, and the ability to regulate emotions.A major benefit of CBT seems to be that it replicates the ability to accept different thoughts and feelings.First Steps in MindfulnessAlthough there is no one-size-fits-all approach to mindfulness, the different modalities based on established research all offer a number of benefits.Meditation: A combination of deep concentration and a focus on sensations, sounds, sights, and relationships can be used to boost the capacity for attention and focus. Research suggests a combination of practice and daily meditation is key to optimal results. Certain modalities, like Kundalini Yoga, use inhales and exhales as specific points of focus and include “zen techniques” to improve attention and focus. Yoga Focused Practice: A meditation with a different focus than the “observation, concentration, and stress reduction” of CBT. The specific focus for “Yoga Focused Practice” can be accessed through the practice of a foundation sequence and guided imagery.The emphasis is on self-awareness and opening to engaging in unlimited awareness within and outside of the body. Through Yoga Yoga Practitioner Training: An important component of mental and physical health is building the ability to practice without limitation. A model of “mindfulness practice and Yoga Focused Practice” is described to help first-time practitioners develop the skillset and practice.This model builds the ability to practice both tasks at the same time. Since yoga has also been touted as a key to promoting an active, engaged mind, more formal training in yoga may be recommended for beginners. Therapies: Life Coach Training: The focus is on finding and developing an individualized program for self-developing tools and strategies to sustain practices that support improving self-awareness and relationship with others. Therapies are available either individually or in conjunction with life coaching or coaching groups. Learning to Cultivate Upward Bound:The concept is that mindfulness can lead you to you where you want to go. What may seem like a crazy goal at first may seem achievable and maybe easier than the original thought. It’s not about finding time for meditation, it’s about finding space within yourself to take on new tasks and interests in every area of your life. Ironically, cultivating new behaviours is part of the formative period of growth as a person. Short-term Stress Management: Each practice can also have a positive impact on your stress level. Practice can promote greater attention, focus, and the ability to take in and value information.Potential and/or current stressors may be eased by helping you with managing negative emotions.

With hardly a jolly story in the headlines and frowns on every face, it’s important to look ahead and shed a positive light on 2020. One form of entertainment that works pretty well in these conditions: video games.As games become more advanced, more diverse, and generally more jaw-dropping, it’s no surprise that there are a whole bunch of incredible new titles destined to drop in 2020.Returning to glory after relative obscurity in 2016, DOOM is back on top in a big way. Injecting a much-needed sense of unabashed fun into modernity’s obsession with serious, player tailored story arcs, id Software created something magnificent.Now with a slew of new weapons, faster movement mechanics, more enemies and a deeper story, we suspect this will be one of the most beloved releases of the year. And rightly so! At some point, people forgot the core mechanics of what made games so fun in the first place: shooting, bloodshed, and fun. Bucketloads of fun.With DOOM Eternal just around the corner, we can already smell the gore.  once more for an absolute rollercoaster of modern FPS glory.If we told you last year there would be a new Half-Life game dropping in 2020 you wouldn’t have believed us, and I don’t blame you! Half-Life 2: Episode 2 came out in 2007 and we’ve heard barely a peep since.Yet, with Valve still behind the franchise, our hearts retain more than a little hope. Recognising the demand for a AAA VR experience, Valve has been working on Half-Life: Alyx for over five years. The gameplay looks gorgeous, captivating, and incredibly fun. One of the more intriguing titles to be releasing this year.One of the most highly anticipated indie titles of the year, Hollow Knight: Silksong is a 2D Metroidvania game from Australian developer Team Cherry. It seems to take the darkness and intrigue of Limbo, and meld that with the character design and boss battles of Cuphead. To sum it up, the game looks stunning and wholly enveloping.In a world where indie developers can essentially craft AAA releases, this is another shining example of a team of three creating something that looks exceptional. If you haven’t already got a Switch, this will be the game for you to finally embrace the conversion.After FromSoftware’s incredible Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice it’s safe to say that our blood is hot for more samurai action, except this time there are no monsters or demons. Sucker Punch’s Ghosts Of Tsushima is set in feudal Japan, around the time of the Mongol invasion.The tale of vengeance follows a lone samurai defending Tsushima, where you are the last surviving member of your clan.“In Infamous you explore powers. In this game, we let you explore what it is to be a samurai inside of this enormous landscape of medieval Japan,” says creative director Nate Fox. The open-world scenes look just as majestic as the combat and movement and, let’s just say, the hype is very real.By tying in parkour, sprawling vertical cityscapes, and an in-depth crafting system, Techland were able to carve their own space into an already well-worn genre of zombie apocalypses. Expanding on the formula that made the original so great, Dying Light 2 looks to employ more character development and tailored storytelling into the mix.Set 15 years after the original, Dying Light 2 takes places in the last great human settlement, though it seems to have plunged into a gothic dark age. The whole game can be played in 4-person co-op and we cannot wait to face more unspeakable horrors when the sun goes down.The long-awaited follow up to the masterful Halo 5: Guardians, 343 Industries have certainly got big shoes to fill. But truth be told, after taking over the franchise from Bungie, they have hardly made a misstep. While there is no set release date as of yet, Halo: Infinite will be an exclusive release with the , slated to drop in late 2020. However, it’s reasonable to assume the COVID-19 outbreak could delay the release plan.Die-hard fans will be excited to know that Master Chief will be returning to the franchise along with  doing the voice acting for aliens. Plus, to utilise the power of the new console, 343 industries have developed a new game engine called Slipspace. Sounds pretty appropriate if you ask me.Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the latest entry in the beloved social franchise. Players can explore desert islands in the charming life simulator as well as link up with other players in-game. If you need some wholesome living amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, then Animal Crossing: New Horizons absolutely has you sorted.This engrossing, expansive, and idyllic looking game is what everyone in the world needs right now as they . Luckily the release date is just around the corner, so grab your copy now if you aren’t keen on heading down the store.While almost zero information has been released thus far, Elden Ring is still one of the most anticipated games of the year. This mash-up feels like something simultaneously natural yet genius, and one that absolutely no one saw coming.The mastermind behind Dark Souls, Hidetaka Miyazaki is teaming up with Game of Thrones’ George R.R. Martin for a gritty, high-fantasy adventure. With two eternally grim minds behind it, we can expect a gorgeously realised, bloodthirsty world with colourful, in-depth lore. Although almost nothing has been revealed yet one thing can be said for certain, it finally makes sense why Martin has taken so long on the next Game Of Thrones book.Cyberpunk 2077 is the long-awaited follow up to the massively popular , a franchise that brought Polish developer CD Projekt Red out of anonymity, and rightly so. The Witcher 3 was a sprawling masterpiece based on the popular novels by Andrzej Sapkowski.CD Projekt Red’s ambitious follow-up looks like it’s ready to take the hype head-on. Instead of swords, sorcery, and witches, it’s guns, cybernetics, and Keanu Reeves. If you’re a fan of near-perfect role-playing then you’d be wise to keep your eyes peeled on Cyberpunk 2077.Considering the last game came out in 2013 and it was a downright masterpiece, yep, is rightfully earns its place on this list. The gameplay looks insanely beautiful, gritty, intense, and most of all, human. This time around we play through Ellie, fighting for survival in a brutal world and meditating on morality and human nature. Sounds like the first game? That’s because it is. Why fix something that isn’t broken?A new trailer has even given us our first glimpse of Joel, though they now seem estranged as Ellie embarks of a raging violent mission to avenge her dead lover. The complex gameplay mechanics, gorgeous graphics, and emotionally impactful trailers are enough to get us shaking in our boots. With excitement? With fear?

Geotagging is very useful for all companies to provide his/ her exact location on google.", "word-count": 891, "body": "What is the purpose of Geotagging? is a simple process of locating the exact location of a particular location where an object has been placed.Geotagging is used by companies who want to know about their customers' shopping habits, as well as those of their competitors.There are various types of geotags, but the most common is a latitude and longitude code that is placed on the object which identifies the exact location where it was placed.Many other types of geotags exist, including a street address, which shows the exact street and area that it was in.Geotagging helps businesses track down their customers; and they also know their customers' behavior patterns.For example, if a business has two branches in the same street, and the owner wants to know the number of cars that go through their doors each day, then he or she can determine the exact location where people are going to the shops.This type of information is very valuable for businesses to have; not just because it can help them improve their services, but because it will allow them to measure the effectiveness of their .If they learn that they are only getting a proportion of the traffic that they are expecting, then it is possible that they should consider making changes so that their advertisements do not annoy people.Geographical information system (GIS) is a kind of software that is used by people who want to know the location of objects.The software consists of many maps that are used to determine the location of a specific place on earth; they are then fed into computer programs that make the calculations.The software is then made available online for people to use, but the information provided by the software is always very accurate.What is Geotagging?Geotagging is the process of tracking a person's location and using it to find out information on where they are or their precise location. It was originally developed for tracking the location of satellites in space, but now it is used in almost every type of industry and sport.Geotagging has become more popular as the number of people who use GPS has increased dramatically over recent years.Companies and individuals that use GPS systems, such as navigation systems and car tracking systems, use GPS tracking to help find their way if they become lost.However, many businesses use geotagging to track employees to make sure they are working safely on site.A person who has their  installed will be able to locate the exact point where they are within the location.This means they can find their way back to their workplace if they get lost or if they simply want to get out of their office.The GPS locator will record the exact location of the employee in question, which means they can always track down their location.If the employee does leave the premises, it is possible for the business to send an emergency response team to their location.Because GPS systems allow the user to see exactly where they are, business owners can also monitor the movement of their employees if they choose to.Many types of businesses have been found to use GPS tracking to track their employees' locations, such as those with a casino or a golf course.In these cases, the GPS tracker is also used to track the progress of their employees and how long they spend at each location, so they know if something untoward is going on.For companies that have employees who work outside of the office, there is another important benefit to having GPS trackers - they allow employees to remain safe while they are on their business trips.What is geotagging and why is it useful?Geotagging is a term that describes the use of a GPS device to track the position of an object. This can be useful in many different circumstances, but it is also useful for many other things.It is often used for hunting. If you are going out with your hunting partner, it would be difficult to know where they are in relation to you unless you have a way to track their position. Geotagging is one such way to do this.A GPS tracker is installed on your vehicle and when it is in the process of being moved it will be fitted with the tracking device.The unit will be able to transmit the location of the vehicle as it moves through the landscape. Many of the tracking devices now on the market come with a built-in clock as well as a map.This gives the user all of the information that they need when they want it.In some instances, the tracking device will also be able to display the temperature of the area in question so that the person who is using the tracker can determine what it is that is causing the animals to be moving in a certain direction.One of the most common reasons that someone uses a GPS tracker is for tracking their pet. If you have a dog you have probably heard of the term geocaching.This is where the person who owns the device that keeps track of the dog finds a piece of equipment and hides it somewhere within the terrain.They then put a tag on the object that has the GPS information on it. This allows people to follow the path of the dog as it explores its environment.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/communication/what-is-the-purpose-of-geotagging.html"},

To prevent this defect, we should take some measure to prevent this, as follows: (1) Optimize the cooling time: optimize the cooling process of the rectangular steel pipe slab, specially for the stacking temperature and stacking duration. If the rolled steel plate thickness≤80mm, the residence time in the cooling bed shall not over 5 minutes after the steel plate hot straightened. Steel plates with a thickness &gt;80mm can be appropriately extended to 10 mints to ensure that the temperature of the steel plates is controlled above 500 before stacking. The cooling time for steel plate thickness ≤50mm is 12h; the cooling time for steel plate thickness &gt;50mm is 24h, and it is strictly forbidden to unstack and finish in advance. (2) Optimal control the cooling process: The appearance of bainite in the rectangular steel pipe blanks is caused by the excessive cooling rate. When the cooling rate is reduced to 3-5°C/s, the segregation zone in the core of the steel plate no longer has a bainite structure and forms a conventional pearlite structure. The structural stress of the segregation zone in the center of the slab was significantly reduced after controlled cooling process, and the microcracks caused by the structural stress will reduced. (3) Centralized furnace loading systemIn actual productionThe length and width of the rolled steel plate are quite different. If the stacking of the steel plate is not neat when the steel plate is slowly cooled, it will cause the inspection of the edge of the ultra-wide plate or the inspection of the head of the ultra-long plate to fail. Through the establishment of a centralized furnace system, centralized furnaces with similar length and width of rolled steel plates are arranged to ensure the neat stacking of subsequent steel plates. When necessary, the rectangular tube slab is wrapped with asbestos cloth to enhance the heat preservation effect.  the Steel Pipe Division of ADTO GROUP, is one of the leading manufacturers of steel products in China.

Investments can be a risky business after all, and data can be used to limit the risks. Many financial companies have gotten used to employing data from more traditional sources as part of their analysis and assessment. Some of these traditional sources can include SEC filings, customer credit scores, press releases, and more.As the world has become inundated with more and more , the traditional data sources, while adequate, only give a portion of useful information. The finance industry can do so much more if they have more data. That’s where alternative data comes in. According to a 2020 survey from Dataminr, around 79% of institutional investors say they use some type of alternative data. It’s clear that many within the finance industry are turning to alternative data and seeing the results they want.Put simply, alternative data is data that has been collected from anywhere outside traditional data sources. That can be different for pretty much any industry. In the case of the financial industry, if data comes from a source outside traditional areas like SEC filings and credit sources, it can safely be considered as alternative data.When companies collect alternative data, it will sometimes come in a highly unstructured form. There’s also usually a lot of it. Many organizations will refer to alternative data as big data, but big data is mainly a reference to the amount, whereas alternative data refers to where it comes from.With so many traditional data sources at their disposal, why would financial institutions and investors want to use alternative data? Traditional data sources have certainly served them well for many years, but there’s so much more data for them to use out there. Alternative data helps provide additional insights that these institutions wouldn’t normally have. This data gives them a bigger and clearer picture of the financial situation surrounding an individual, organization, industry, or even an entire economy. For example, some investment firms have recently taken to analyzing satellite imagery to assess the health of a local economy. This is done by taking satellite photos of shopping center parking lots and counting the number of cars there at any given time. From that information, they can determine how many people are shopping, which can indicate the current economic state.When it comes to  from the web, there’s virtually no limit to the type and quantity of data available. Our blog post takes you through a few typical data types and How Alternative Data can help in the Finance industryProduct data is one of the most complex but important sources of data that provide critical insights into the performance of a product or a brand. , Walmart, , eBay, etc are great examples of websites that provide thousands of data points to reveal company and category performance.A Product’s rank on an online retailer’s bestseller list can indicate strong performance, while poor ranking and a discount history revealing early price reductions can expose inventory troubles and margin reductions.Advertising data can provide a unique insight into the corporate spend behind product launch and anticipate revenue changes or slow-moving inventory, along with measurements for product traction and adoption.YoY share trends from online retailers are powerful predictive indicators of revenue momentum and stock performance.All this data offers lucrative opportunities for investors when determining market orders and positions.Taking a dive into the lengthy and often nebulous pages of a company’s SEC filings can lead to amazing investment insights. It arms investors with high-quality and reliable information, which is why the demand for web scraped SEC filing data is surging.SEC filings have an immediate impact on stock performance. Markets are highly responsive to filings, whose submission has a direct relationship to increased trade volume. Scraping SEC filings, 10-Ks and 10-Qs produce enormous datasets, revealing non-trivial patterns in huge aggregations of data. Investors can use this information to identify rare opportunities for alpha as well as high performing outliers.Investment managers want first-hand information on the product information and its current performance so that they can accurately predict the stock performance. While the companies quarterly earnings can provide such insights, it may be too late to make profitable decisions.Scraping product reviews can allow investors to proactively gather information on a product life cycle and make more up to date assumptions about company earnings. After all, what’s one of the first metrics many of us look to when deciding on a product? The reviews.Utilizing scraped product reviews to evaluate how a company or product is trending in the category and against Its competition helps hone the perception of risk in the investment decision-making process. Negative consumer reviews can increase stock volatility and pose a serious risk to shareholder value. By extracting product reviews historically and in real-time, smarter and more timely analyses can be performed.Where can we get information straight from the horse’s mouth? A company’s website and its communications are a good place to start. Scraping data from the web may include analyzing company web traffic, announcements, and hiring activity with the aim of accessing otherwise exclusive insights.The following are key pieces of data to monitor:These data give a full picture of a company’s inside track generating extremely useful insights on the company’s trajectories; saving companies from making serious investment blunders.The rise of social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter has led to a flood of public sentiment. Public sentiment on social media gives insight into both the public at large and also any given subset. We might want to glean more information about it.Tweets have incredible predictive value. Companies announce developments on social media channels like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, and sometimes breaking news hits the social media channels before any other traditional mediums. Company popularity and reputation can be monitored carefully and tracked against competitors.With an opportunistic mindset and consistent dataset, investors can track and analyze the changes in a company’s internal framework to make financial decisions.Harnessing the power of quality alternative data will be a decisive advantage in your search for alpha. More data and better data means your investment decision-making process produces more value and consistently.The use of alternative data is the clear future of the financial industry. It’s more extensive, more up to date, and a better indicator than many of the traditional sources that have been around for years. The ironic thing is that once an alternative data source is used for long enough, it may no longer be considered alternative; it will simply become a part of the traditional data framework of the finance industry. No matter what happens, alternative data will likely be part of financial organizations for the foreseeable future.We will be back with another interesting article till then  with us and keep reading.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/affiliate-programs/how-alternative-data-for-finance-can-boost-your-business.html"},

What are creative agencies, and what can hiring a creative agency in Los Angeles do for a business? Here are some of the top things to consider. What is a Creative Agency?Creative agencies are advertising agencies that work creatively to develop outside-the-box solutions for brand development, campaigning, marketing, and other key aspects encouraging business success. A creative agency in Los Angeles should provide their clients with a variety of services, including unique content curation, innovative advertising, consumer insights and analysis, expert guidance for brand development and strategy, and more. Brand Identity &amp; Development A creative agency in Los Angeles that is well received by clients often aids with the formation of brand identity and develops an aspirational image for their client’s business. Without a clear brand identity, voice, and plans, a business will often fail to reach consumers effectively, and it will fail to achieve much success. Creative agencies can provide invaluable guidance for clients towards creating a set of company goals, values, and traits, as well as towards their tactics for advertising expansion and awareness. Unique and Creative Campaign SolutionsConsumers are often tired of and pay little attention to traditional advertising and marketing methods, and the use of a creative agency in Los Angeles ensures that a business isn’t lost among the many unwanted advertisements pushed at their audience. Creative agencies work with innovative, modern techniques for their marketing and development, which allows a business to stand out from the crowd of advertisements and engage more deeply with their consumers. Custom, Curated Content ProductionOne of the ways in which creative agencies assist businesses is through unique content production that is precisely tailored to their audience. A creative agency in Los Angeles can create content which is enjoyed rather than simply tolerated by the target audience. Broad advertisements are largely out of date, and instead, employing custom content which entertains the audience is increasingly essential for a business that wishes to thrive. Media PresenceBusiness success in the modern age is more dependent on social media presence than ever. A creative agency in Los Angeles can use key connections in media to provide businesses with the advantage they need, and a good creative advertising agency will also curate the perfect content for social media that gains a company awareness and generates excitement for the product. Expertise Many business owners try and fail to implement their own marketing strategies in efforts to save cost on hiring professional creative agencies. These attempts only cost the business time and money with often extremely poor results. With a creative agency in Los Angeles, a company has access to experts with years of marketing and advertising experience who have the tools, knowledge, and innovative teams to guarantee success for a campaign. Overall, there are many reasons why businesses can benefit from employing a creative agency in Los Angeles. Creative agencies provide brand development, creative campaign solutions, custom and curated content, media advantages, and critical expertise that allow companies to thrive.

And because of this stark reality and influx of its users which are increasing tremendously across the globe, advertisers pick mobile device as their first choice of medium for paid advertising with consistent budget allocation on that.", "word-count": 782, "body": "Mobile advertising or marketing is no longer a vehicle for only blue chip brands. Today we are seeing mobile media has a budget of its own, and remember It is not just about the media? Technology platform advancements has a fuel up this medium, which was once static and dull banners now turned them into quality engaging experiences.To cut a long story short that the mobile advertising industry is a lot healthier today. Therefore it is mandatory that a mobile advertiser has a complete and flexible plan when approaching their mobile strategy. A successful mobile advertising campaign is a combination of goals, results, creativity and consumption knowledge of the mobile users. To be successful in mobile advertising, starting steps to get there are simple but mostly neglected.Step one:When we began as marketers, we did little without a clearly defined goal. However enhanced technologies made it more difficult to measure, and at the same time we all started throwing things at the wall just to see what would stick. Measuring targeting and deep reporting enable us to set &amp; see the clear goal. These can be as simple as driving clicks, refine CTR or as complex as store visits. In any scenario a clearly defined goal is essential to proving the value of your mobile activation campaign plan.Step two:Understanding of your consumer &amp; respect them. Today we are seeing more &amp; more devices becoming a part of mainstream, means variety of ad formats for users. Say that you are managing a great client brand but just because brand is great does not naturally mean that users will spend time and energy to engage with it? Don't worry the formula is simple, Offer value to consumers in a quick engaging manner... few clicks and they are their!Step three:As a serious marketer/account manager your focus should be on complete user experience, not just the media advertisement. Start with where the user entered the ad, what did they give up to engage with brand? What will they do next? You should try drawing the full mobile advertising user experience on a piece of paper. Do not stop there, once the ad is in QA ask you coworker to test it. You will learn a lot and once live, check your reports regularly to see if users are engaging the way you foresee? If not then change it.Step four:Be innovative and do not refrain to try something new. We were only able to arrive at this juncture because those before us tried (succeed and failed). Finally choose the right mobile advertising partner. The right partner is hard to find. First and foremost thing is to track as much of the user experience as possible.Converting a mobile impression into a clickTop mobile advertising campaign is just not only well designed ad banner, QR code, App install to a targeted audience. But it's the one that converts an impression to a click and a click to an engaged user? Many of us are missing that element. Too many mobile advertisements take users to a desktop friendly Web site instead of a mobile site. Whereas Mobile landing pages and mobile microsites provide a mobile friendly experience that is designed to maximize in reaching the goal of your campaign(engagement/conversion). Specialized mobile landing pages provide the critical next step in an ad message and have potential of leveraging even if a business does not have an existing mobile site.To achieve success with mobile advertising, advertisers need to map out the entire mobile user experience. That determines the best approach to copy, creative, design and technology. Here are a few best practices for mobile landing pages and common pitfalls to avoid.Messaging and copyKeep copy very concise and put the most important information at the top. When you think you have cut down on copy, cut some more.Design1. Use finger friendly buttons to eliminate the possibility of user's frustration2. Clean design and make sure graphics are readable even when sized down.3. Keep a same brand look so consumers feel comfortable interacting with your channel?4. Do not use Flash or fancy JavaScript. (Usually this make page heavy)Mobile engagement1. Use of click-to-call, interactive maps and location-based promotions.2. Provide a link to your main Web site for visitors to explore more if they desire.Development1. Minimize the load time. With content rich page get heavy and you risk a negative brand impression and lost page views.2. Use short page titles allowing visitors to know what page they are on.Lastly the right partner does not stop working for you when the campaign goes live but that is the easy part. Your work throughout the campaign, optimizing and suggesting changes is the key to win &amp; achieve your client goals.https://www.expertek.net", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/advertising/decade-of-mobile-advertising-how-to-be-successful.html"},

{"heading": "Scrap Yard Near Me - 5 Considerations For Getting The Most Value From Your Car", "author": "5amily Ltd", "description": "You may be eligible to earn some serious bucks if there is some scrap metal lying around your backyard doing nothing other than taking up precious space. If you make a trip before selling your scrap and do your complete homework, there is more for you than the usual for your efforts.", "word-count": 2097, "body": "First off, you need to know what kind of metal do scrap yards buy?Scrap yards usually buy metals that are used in industries like automobiles, steel, and other mechanical works. It includes copper, aluminum, zinc, nickel, lead, iron, steel, stainless steel, and brass. Still, all junkyards won’t buy everything that comes in their way. They all have certain limitations and areas of business.There are also scrap yards that buy almost every broken thing that is past its functional lifespan like home appliances, electronic equipment, old cars, trucks, motorbikes, boats &amp; yachts, airplanes, etc. If something can be sold, they’ll be ready to buy it, at their own price.If you are wondering what they would do with those ‘useless’ things, they tear apart larger appliances and sell useful parts to brokers. Scrap vehicles and their parts may be sold to brokers or to the mechanics in need of spare parts.This industry is much bigger than what most people think it is. That’s the reason those who deal in it earn lucrative profits over selling broken and malfunctioning goods and articles.Below are some practical tips that will enable you to get more money off your old car if you decide to sell it to your nearby junkyard for quick cash:There is simply no way you can earn top dollar for your scrap car if you don’t have any idea what it’s worth. What seems to you a heap of old rusted metal can be a gold mine to others. So, it’s important to do a bit of study and research and arrive at an educated guess about how much money you can get from your old car. It’s perfectly fine not to know the exact amount. But if you reach the neighborhood of the actual value, you will have enough knowledge to haggle your way to the best deal. Now, the scrap yard dealers are no kids but knowledge will give your power, and knowing the real value of your stuff will prevent you from settling for less.The best way to find the value of your old car is to browse through the internet and see what people are demanding and offering. For instance, you can search “old sedan car value” or “old car scrap value” and there will be several results for you to sample.Make sure you go through at least ten search results so that you can end up with consistent information. It won’t take much time but you will be armed with a weapon that will come in handy at the negotiation table.In an area where there are many dealers under a small radius, it’s best to make calls around to check metal prices before taking all the metal (in this case, your old car) to a junkyard. If you don’t know the exact location of a scrap yard, find them by searching online for “metal scrap yard near me” or doing other relevant queries.Scrap dealers don’t spit out the exact quote for the merchandise but they surely will give you a minimal figure on how much they pay per pound for which kind of metal. When you make calls to several dealers, it will be enough for you to know which one offers the best money.Here is a pro tip: the size of a scrap yard does not necessarily mean it will give the best value for your old car. Bigger yards are not supposed to be better all the time. You may find a small-time dealer to earn top dollar.If it’s possible logistically, try to haul all your scrap to the scrap yard in one trip. Most places do not have any limit of intake per day or month. It means they can take as much as they like until the deal is sweet for them.Hauling your old car to a junkyard will put you in an advantageous position where you can hustle and make the dealer give up to your demands. If you have some more back at home, let the dealer know. This little trick will get you even more money. Scrap dealers love large volumes because it reduces logistical costs and they could yield more metal in less time. The bottom line is, the more you bring in, the more power you will have to get the best value.It’s best to split your metal according to their value and nature before hauling it all to the scrap yard. If you have metal with some type of casing on it, you should remove it before trying to sell it. It’s important on two fronts.The first and foremost is that if the dealer had to separate the metals, he’d use this extra work as an excuse to pay you less for your scrap. It’s the general rule of thumb.The second and more important thing is the variation in the value of different metals. In bulk, a slight difference can yield significant money. Split the metal and negotiate for the price of each kind. That’s the trick.Hauling a lot of metal is not an easy task. It surely does not go into little cardboard boxes. If you don’t have a truck to take your old car to a scrap dealer, here is what you can do without sweating much.Number one is to check around your circle of friends and family and see if someone has a truck and he or she is willing to loan it to you for a day. In return, as a token of goodwill, you can offer to wash it or get the interior vacuumed on your way back to them.If this does not work out for some reason, you can always look around and rent a truck. Many movers offer regular trucks for hauling goods and articles and the rentals run as low as 20 bucks a day for in-town use.This scrap yard business is not like a modern enterprise procuring articles or raw material and demands a market-oriented price for their goods. There are not many odds to find an honest and trustworthy scrap yard dealer who would be upfront with you and offer you the real value for your old car. Maybe, you already know that. The world we live in, we need to constantly look out for our potential interests in order to materialize them.Laws and regulations to conduct business in the scrap industry vary from state to state. At the very least, they are obligated by law to secure a license before starting their shop. This is regular permission granted by competent authorities to all kinds of businesses which allows them to operate in an area after fulfilling certain criteria. Usually, there is a fee to be paid to acquire such a license and get registered with the state.Depending on your state laws and locality, there is a chance that a special scrap metal license had to be issued in order to transact business legally.To avoid any inconvenience, it’s best to contact your state and find out if any special permit is needed or you can ask the scrap yard dealers to show you all the legal paperwork.Dealing with illegal business can land you in serious trouble. So, be sure before taking your old car to a scrap yard.Dishonest and shady scrap dealers will do everything in their power to confuse you. The main motive behind this misdirection is to pay you as little as possible for your metal (or in this case, your old car). If you are having a hard time determining what’s best for you, a scrap dealer is not the right person to ask for guidance, because it will be the surest way to get ripped off.Another trick that almost all scrap dealers have up their sleeves is to scam you of your precious metal by rushing through the deal. They will try to close the deal without answering any question you might have in your mind. They come off as “take it or leave it” guys and offer an upfront price without telling you why.A fair dealer will ask you if you have any doubts or second thoughts about your scrap and give all the information you need. He won’t try to rush through the deal and show eagerness of ripping you off. He will offer you a price after discussing the properties of your scrap and explain why he is doing so.When a scrap dealer provides you a quote for your old car you need to sell, make sure to ask whether the cost of towing is included in the quote or not. A standard practice in the market involves no hidden charges or fees, which means the scrap dealer needs to be upfront and covers the towing fee in the quote. In your own interest, be sure to ask specifically about the inclusion of the towing fee in the quote.The best way to get a fair deal for your car from a scrap dealer is to call multiple shops and compare prices before hauling your car to a dealer. Honest dealers are mostly fair in their dealings and cover all the expenses in their quotes. You will find many scrap dealers in your area when you search online for “scrap yards near me”. Call a couple of dealers that are at the top of the search results to get the best price for your car.Many big scrap dealers have their own fleet of trucks and other trailers for hassle-free transportation. It helps them in cutting logistical costs. But, not all own their own trucks, and some work in partnership with local independent truckers and pay them a fee for each vehicle they pick up.A potential scam bell rings when a scrap dealer agrees to pay you a certain amount and you agree to progress the deal. When the tow truck operator shows up at your door, he’d say that your car is pure junk and does not yield what the scrap dealer is offering you. The tow truck dealer may have his eyes set on the difference if you succumb to his coercion.The other potential way to scam you is when the scrap dealer agrees to get the towing costs from the deal but the tow truck operator asks you to pay him upfront. He might want to get a double-dip or he could be working with the scrap dealer to rip you off.If you suspect any activity that does not correspond with what you have agreed to do with the scrap dealer, call him right away and clear things out before paying the tow truck operator or handing him your old car.Even when a vehicle cannot be driven, you need to transfer the title from your name to the scrap dealer. In addition to this, you need to contact immediately your local department of motor vehicles and cancel the registration. If you carry on with your idea of selling your old vehicle for cash, still, you will be liable for it.Before the tow truck operator loads up your old car on the flatbed, make sure to remove all your personal effects. It includes registration and tags of your vehicle and other paperwork.When a scrap dealer offers you that he’ll take care of all the paperwork, steer clear of such claims. Potentially, it could be a setup for a scam where they take your car and then charge for storing your vehicle on their lot. If you resist and try to fight your case, they will send your old car to a collections agency, which will hurt your credit score.It’s not worth it to take unnecessary risks while selling scrap to a dealer. Before closing the deal, make sure you double-check all the points. To avoid surprises in the future, everything should be done 100% correctly.Last but not least, don’t take a bow when you are negotiating to sell your old car (or scrap). This is the surest way to get the best price. Never accept what dealers offer you upfront, even if it exceeds your expectations. They are professional hustlers and do bidding for their own interest all day long. Ask for more whenever you think that you are underpaid. This is truer when you have a lot of metal to sell. There is no guarantee if you will be offered a better price, but it does not cost much to ask for more.While negotiating, dealers will set traps in your way. To get the best value for your old car, you need to best those traps and get to the top.Following are certain ways a dealer lure you into accepting an inferior deal: Read more about", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/advice/scrap-yard-near-me-5-considerations-for-getting-the-most-value-from-your-car.html"},

{"heading": "How do Fat girls Avoid Inferiority and Maintain Self-confidence?", "author": "Charlie Deen", "description": "Now we are generally pursuing the state of being thin and beautiful. Therefore, some fat girls always feel inferiority. Here are some tips for them to maintain self-confidence.", "word-count": 755, "body": "Thin people have certain advantages in many things. For example, thin people have more choices in clothes. The aesthetic trends of the society and the inconvenience have made many fat girls become less and less self-confident, and even shrink in a corner to protect themselves. In fact, today’s social aesthetic is relatively deformed, because some people pursue the beauty of thin blindly. It seems that the thinner a girl is, the more beautiful she will be. Girls who are slightly plump or obese are not worthy of walking on the street. This kind of deformed aesthetics is actually perverted. Many girls go on a diet to lose weight, just to become thinner. To put it bluntly, it’s a prejudice against the body of fat girls. In fact, fat girls also have many beauties, but some people’s aesthetics do not understand the beauty of these girls. In this world, it is not only thin people who are worthy of praise, fat girls can still live well. To improve self-confidence, you must first explore the shining points, don’t pay attention to the opinions of individual people, and improve yourself. So in the face of appearance problems, how should fat girls stay confident?1. Explore your own advantagesNot all men like the girls with same style. Although you may not be satisfied with your appearance, you may be a kind and lovely person. You should always discover more of your strengths and get to know yourself better. Don’t feel that obesity is your fault just because of some people’s gossips. In fact, it’s not a mistake to look at a person’s body. But fat girls can also improve their health through their own reasonable diet and more exercise. The beauty of health is the best. Therefore, you must not be presumptuous, even if you are a little bit fatter. You should believe that people are the same. You can’t deny yourself, don’t look down on yourself because of others’ opinions. If you look at your strengths, you’ll find that you’re really great.2. Make more friends and take part in outdoor activities oftenDon’t generalize. Everyone is unique and you need to be sure of yourself. Appearance is not all of a person; it’s just a part of it. Everyone has his own unique quality and personality. Maybe you are born to be fat or become fatter than others in the acquired environment; you should not deny yourself completely because of this aspect. Fat girls should not be afraid of what others think of you, you should go out of the house bravely and make more friends. Many like-minded friends, whether of the opposite sex, or girlfriends, as long as you get along well with each other, you should play together. All kinds of outdoor sports, such as mountaineering, wading, square fitness, etc., are the most exercised activities, which are very beneficial to the cultivation of interpersonal skills and the enhancement of your social adaptability. (If you have a job, communicate with your colleagues more often.)3. Participate in various public welfare activities to cultivate confidenceEveryone has love, especially the fat girls. We suggest that fat girls can take part in more public welfare activities and volunteer activities, such as volunteer work, voluntary labor in welfare homes and nursing homes, and offer their love and receive praise from others. Isn’t it very happy? And through participating in public welfare activities, you can further cultivate your ability to devote yourself to the society and serve the society. And you will gradually cultivate a high degree of confidence, so that you can gradually get rid of the inferiority complex in my heart.4. Challenge more and strengthen your sense of accomplishmentSome fat girls lack self-confidence; they will close themselves in a small space and are unwilling to communicate with others. But if you take part in more challenges, you will find that many fat girls are actually very confident. In their hearts, they think they are the most beautiful women; we call them ‘BBW’ which means ‘big beautiful women’, and this kind of girl is really beautiful. Also you can find lots of big beautiful women on . When something needs you to pay a lot or seems impossible to achieve, once you accomplish it, you will have a great sense of accomplishment. Slowly, your self-confidence grows stronger invisibly. So we usually need to do more things and challenge ourselves.Here are some tips to help fat girls to become big beautiful women.

{"heading": "Why Does My Car Not Start Though The Lights Come On?", "author": "5amily Ltd", "description": "Many worst-case scenarios come to mind when you turn the key in the ignition of your car but it does not start though the lights come on. From the lights turning on, you know the fact that the electrical components of your car are partially working, but there are still many things that are wrong with your car. Many systems within your car work independently from the lighting systems such as the transmission, engine, etc.", "word-count": 723, "body": "There is no “right time” for a car to give up on its owner. So, we’ll go through certain reasons that usually stop your vehicle’s engine from turning over.If the lights work fine and the radio is playing but the car does not start, there could be multiple factors at play. One of the most common problems is a dead battery. If you ask why all the other electrical components such as lights, radio, etc., are working when the battery does not have enough power, the answer is each component requires a different current amount or maybe something is interrupting the current path towards them. In this case, the current may not be able to reach the engine, thus, preventing it from turning over.Here is the rundown of probable reasons:One of the main culprits that stop your engine from turning over is a dead or dying battery. Some of the electrical parts require a very low charge, or amperage, usually not more than 20-30 amps, That’s why they can work just fine on a dying or almost dead battery.Contrary to this, engine starters, which make the engine turn over, require around 300 amps at once. This demands much more energy than a couple of lights and a radio.While using a hydrometer to test the charge, if the battery tests low or if it’s too weak to pass the load test, it all indicates to the fact that your battery needs to be recharged to run the engine properly. If you jump the battery from another battery and the engine starts working, it means there is not a problem anymore because the issue is resolved.If jumping your battery does not work, then it could be a malfunctioning blown fuse, a broken ignition switch, or a problematic starter.Lucky for you, you can easily determine whether your vehicle has blown the fuse. Finding a blown fuse is one of the primary steps to figure out the problem in your vehicle’s system that halts the engine from starting. A blown fuse is a delicate piece of machinery and will likely blow after a small period.Certain indications point to a blown fuse which includes accessories losing power, the circuits start to overload, or the fuse will appear broken or disconnected. This stops the engine from starting but the light of your vehicle will come on.If the battery is not working or if it is dead, you need to replace or repair the battery. Depending on your budget, cause of the problem, and the condition of your battery, you need to decide which one os the best way to move forward- replacement or repair. For many car-owners, it’s not a good deal to buy a car with a dead battery.If the battery of your vehicle is not too hammered down and still have some power in it, it’s time to check for a blown fuse or a fusible link. Consult with your car’s manual to find the exact location of the fuse box and then look for damaged metal wire or fuse. A blown fuse can prevent power from reaching the starter delay if the metal wire in the plastic is damaged or completely disconnected.If the fuse and the fusible links are fine and have passed the test, next comes the real problem- the ignition switch of your car. The popular belief that an ignition switch is that piece of mechanical hardware where your car keys go in and turn. In reality, it’s the electrical switch inside that the car key touches and activates when the mechanical component is inserted into the ignition inlet. In many cases, an ignition switch only provides power to the electrical components like the headlights, radio, etc., but not the engine starter.Another test to check the integrity of your car’s components is to check if the engine is cranking or not. It is cranking but still unable to start, it means that the electrical systems are fine.Certain things need to be working properly for a car to start: air, fuel, and compression.There are solutions if you think the problem with your vehicle is related to its fuel. If the temperature is low and cold enough, there are fair chances that the fuel line may have frozen which prevents the fuel from circulating. Professional assistance is needed to thaw the fuel line. Read more about", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/advice/why-does-my-car-not-start-though-the-lights-come-on.html"},

With a high budget, you don’t need to buy a used GPU.

Only Buy From Trusted SellersThere are several places and sellers out there selling used GPUs, but always make sure you are buying from a trusted seller.

{"heading": "Top Tips for Effective Household Rubbish Removal", "author": "Nancy Whitman", "description": "A clean house in a family household is a challenge in itself. When cleaning a house, especially of a young family, there are chances that you might find a lot of waste items, especially when you are looking to sort things out. Disposing of that waste material can be a task in itself, and you need to dispose of them at the right place most importantly.", "word-count": 535, "body": "This whole process of waste removal, particularly , can be a very time-consuming thing, mainly when the local authorities are focusing more on collecting less waste whilst increasing the complexity of waste disposal. Instead, the authorities are also imposing fines on people who do not dispose off the trash in a directed manner.However, some steps can be taken on your part to reduce the wastage and play your role in protecting the environment. The first step that you can start is by cutting on the things that you bring into your houses and by also cutting down the amount of food that is wasted. Here are some steps that can be followed to achieve effective household rubbish removal:Less packaging - The primary waste from households involves packaging material from various products. It would help if you started buying products that are not wrapped or not packed in one-time packing material. You can also begin by avoiding ready to eat meals. Further, you can buy items such as rice, beans, cereal etc. in large quantity as these are packed in a paper which is recycled; therefore, this saves packaging. It would be best if you also tried to pack things in a recyclable material rather than plastic and such other stuff.Plastic bottles - One of the major sources of waste is packaged drinking water or packaged soft drinks. It is essential to realize that most of these plastic bottles cannot even be recycled and are just thrown away to be decomposed for the next 400-450 years. You can save all that by just investing in a water filter which is relatively much cheaper and give you an unlimited supply of clean drinking water. Also, you can reduce this wastage by reusing the water bottles rather than buying a new one every time you go out. Food wastage - It is a sad state of affairs that about 40% of the food that we grow around the world goes to waste. When looking at some countries and resources available, this is a huge wastage of both the resources and energy. To avoid all this wastage, you can check your fridge every couple of days and make use of the already available resources before buying new ones. It also means reviewing the resources that are already available in your freezer, as well. It will not only save a lot of money but will also contribute to less food wastage.Toiletries - There is a lot of wastage when it comes to toiletries. It is to be realized that the cosmetics that we use are mostly liquid and are packed in loads of plastic to make their containers. This amounts to a lot of wastage. This can be reduced considerably in the following ways:If you’re currently renting and looking to move out of your existing property, then enlisting the services of a professional  can be a lifesaver. They help you avoid the back-breaking labour and arduous tasks of removing large and cumbersome white goods, electrical equipment and everything in between. Likewise, if you a loved one has recently passed away and you are looking to have the property professionally cleaned before it’s eventual sale, then a  are an excellent option.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/advice/top-tips-for-effective-household-rubbish-removal.html"},

{"heading": "Things You Shouldn't Bring at an Oil Rig", "author": "Bern Gal", "description": "Working at an", "word-count": 346, "body": "Part of that training is also knowing what and what not to bring at an oil rig, as certain items can cause accidents on the site. See below. 1. Electronic gadgets and other spark-inducing itemsIt’s a rule for oil and gas personnel to not bring their electronic gadgets such as cellphones and cameras outside of their sleeping quarters. This is because usage of such in an environment with flammable elements can cause fires and explosions. Even when taking photos for documentation, for example,  are used to ensure safety. Of course, this also extends to other spark-inducing belongings, such as lighters or candles. 2. Flammable substancesBringing items with flammable properties and chemicals is also a no-no. This includes known  such as aerosols, acetone, kerosene, denatured alcohol, and more. Remember, you’re already in an oil rig with a whole workplace full of combustibles. Don’t add to it more by bringing your own, thereby increasing the risk of danger. 3. Obstructive belongingsWhile these things don’t necessarily cause explosions or fires the way the first two items do, having belongings that can easily impede the smoothness of operations is still a huge risk. For example, leaving your backpack lying around can cause a rushing colleague to trip over it, hurting themselves or others in the process. If you feel that something is unnecessary and will only be left messily around the workplace, better to not bring it at all. And even with your essentials, don’t leave them unattended in case you misplace them or if it unintentionally causes harm. As a future oil and gas worker, it is your responsibility to make sure the site is a safe place to work. This is to reduce the chance of danger so operations can continue. The industry is quite an important one to the economy and to everyday life. A delay caused by accidents can be detrimental to many.  By avoiding bringing certain dangerous items, you can potentially lessen the risks by a huge amount.

Tiles on the bathroom wall work well in all those places that are flooded or splashed with water: above the bathtub, in the shower, behind the sink. And it is enough to attach them only there. We advise the height of tiles in the bathroom.", "word-count": 649, "body": "Tiles on the bathroom wall do not have to occupy the entire surface of the bathroom, sometimes it is enough if the tiles in the bathroom are only laid in places prone to splashing and getting wet. The height of the glazing - what you need to remember. Well-arranged tiles will protect the wall and will be a decorative element. We advise you to what height to lay the bathroom tiles.Laying tiles: important decisionsChoosing the type of bathroom tiles and how to arrange them should not be put off until the last minute. Planning the finish already at the construction stage allows you to choose the best materials and avoid unnecessary problems when arranging the bathroom. Tiling works are a tedious and long-lasting job. Laying tiles requires accuracy and careful preparation. It is not enough to vacuum the substrate and simply stick the tiles. The need to arrange patterns, cut elements and finish all contacts means that the first thing to do is to design the arrangement of tiles on the floors or walls in the bathroom, so select the appropriate type, size, pattern, measure straight surfaces and places of planned cuts, determine the way of finishing the contacts. The type of materials used for installation and the way of carrying out the work related to laying bathroom tiles depend on it.Laying tiles should always start from the most exposed place. If it is a corner of the room, the tiles on the floor as well as on the walls should be trimmed as completely or evenly as possible, and the joints carefully finished. If the attention is not focused in a specific place, but on a larger area, you need to take care of its harmonious appearance or consciously insert a strong decorative accent that will catch the eye. Regardless of the solution used, in order for the cladding to look nice, appropriate, undamaged tools must be used for cutting and grinding the elements, and holes for sockets or pipe penetrations should be made with hole saws.How to put tiles in the bathroomThe bathroom is constantly exposed to the direct action of water, steam and a high concentration of moisture, which makes it easy for microorganisms to develop in it. They always choose the most absorbent surfaces, in which moisture remains for a long time, i.e. joints and corners. Along with the corners, silicone is used instead of the joint. It should also be resistant to microorganisms, that is, sanitary. It is also important to properly protect the substrate against water, for example with liquid foil. Sealing can cover all surfaces, but it is not necessary. However, it must always be on the floor and extended 15 cm to the walls. In the vicinity of the bathtub and shower, the tiles should extend at least 20 cm above the water coverage area.Tiles on the wall in the bathroom: how to lay in the cabinA typical shower cubicle is 200 cm high. Tiles on the wall in the cabin must be laid up to its upper edge. But if there is a bathtub or a washbasin next to it, even though there is no such need, tiles in these places can also be laid up to a height of 2 meters. Then the interior architecture will be consistent.Tiles on the wall in the bathroom: stacking to the height of the sinkIf there is no shower cubicle in the bathroom or the shower is separated behind the wall, the height of the tiles may be determined by the washbasin. The tiles arranged in this way will then constitute a kind of panelling, almost 120 cm high. And if the colour of the tiles and the walls above them are contrasting, it is worth knowing that the horizontal division of the wall slightly below half of the height will visually raise the interior, and a little higher - will lower it.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/advice/how-to-tile-the-bathroom-wall-tiling-height.html"},

Let us sit back and reflect on some important lessons that 2020 has taught us", "word-count": 740, "body": "The year 2020, sigh! What a year has it been? Did anyone of us, even in our wildest dream even think about it? We are sure no! Well the year 2020 has literally changed everything! There is not a single person who can say that he or he has not been affected by it in some way or the other.For some this year has been mundane, slow and boring while for some it has been life-changing- we are talking about those who have witnessed a severe and life-threatening form of COVID-19 or those who have lost a loved one to this monstrous pandemic.The lockdown itself has changed our perspective over ‘n’ number of things in life and has been a teacher of basic survival instincts of millions of us. And for the little more privileged class, the lockdown still has been a change from their modern, luxurious, and lavish lifestyle- giving (some of them at least) a whole new perspective about life.As we begin the last month of this not-so good year, we thought it would be a great idea to reflect upon a few things or lessons that 2020 has taught most of us!Nothing is permanentWith 2020 we know this for sure. Nothing we see, we hold, or we plan is permanent. Things are bound to change in the blink of an eye and change in a way none of us had expected. Thus, we must know the value of right things, do them when they need to be done and let go or be a little less obsessed with things that do not matter. As we say this, we must know this too- that the bad times too, are not permanent. So, let us not get all gloomy and sad over how bad this year has been, let us look forward to a new year and a new start with a positive mindset.Be flexible and adapt While the entire world went into a lockdown, we could barely move out of the house- we saw a lot of things that changed. The entire work-place scenario changed- millions of offices switched asked their employees to work from home and a lot of them continued to do so. A lot of business structures collapsed as they could not fit into this ‘new-normal’ and some businesses who could innovate or be flexible enough to change- survived. It just makes us learn one simple thing- accepting change, adapting to it, being flexible in our thoughts is the key to survive. If we are stuck over our old ideas and principles, we cannot expect to reach new paradigms in life.Make hay while the sun shinesThis is an age old saying, but however it implies perfectly to the year 2020. Learn to take advantage or use any situation to your advantage. It must be challenging at first but gets better when you form a habit out of it.  Instead of panicking, losing hope or feeling like it is the end of the world, find at least one thing even in the worst possible situation that you can use for your advantage. Be gratefulNo other year has taught us gratefulness than 2020 has! Be grateful for the air you breathe, be grateful for the house you live in, be grateful for the food you eat and be grateful for the job you have. We are blessed and incredibly lucky to belong to a privileged class who could manage to stay safely, indoors and have food on our tables everyday despite the entire pandemic crisis. Let us take a moment and be grateful for all that we have and let us also use our position of privilege to help those who do not have access to all these things.Value lifeLife is precious, and we know it more than ever in the year 2020. We have seen the world crumble into pieces for those who have lost their hale, hearty, and healthy loved ones to this pandemic- only making us realise how precious and fragile life is! So, value life, go check up on your neighbour or your parents, your friend or whoever it is that you have not heard from in a couple of days. Give yourself and encourage others to spend some quality time with their loved ones, create memories and cherish them forever.Here is hoping that 2021 shall be a way better year than this, sending each one heaps of love, laughter, and good health!Ciao!", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/advice/5-things-that-the-year-2020-has-taught-us.html"},

This can breed confusion, as people aren’t sure of the difference between terms and approaches. In my experience, data mining and machine learning are a prime example of this.", "word-count": 1417, "body": "Data mining isn’t a new invention that came with the digital age. The concept has been around for over a century but came into greater public focus in the 1930s.According to Hacker Bits,  occurred in 1936, when Alan Turing introduced the idea of a universal machine that could perform computations similar to those of modern-day computers.Forbes also reported on Turing’s development of the  in 1950 to determine if a computer has real intelligence or not. To pass his test, a computer needed to fool a human into believing it was also human. Just two years later, Arthur Samuel created The Samuel Checkers-playing Program that appears to be the world’s first self-learning program. It miraculously learned as it played and got better at winning by studying the best moves.We’ve come a long way since then. Businesses are now harnessing data mining and machine learning to improve everything from their sales processes to interpreting financials for investment purposes. As a result, data scientists have become vital employees at organizations all over the world as companies seek to achieve bigger goals with data science than ever before.With big data becoming so prevalent in the business world, a lot of data terms tend to be thrown around, with many not quite understanding what they mean.  Is there a difference between machine learning vs. data science? How do they connect to each other? Isn’t machine learning just artificial intelligence? All of these are good questions, and discovering their answers can provide a deeper, more rewarding understanding of data science and analytics and how they can benefit a company.Both data mining and machine learning are rooted in data science and generally fall under that umbrella. They often intersect or are confused with each other, but there are a few key distinctions between the two. Here’s a look at some data mining and machine learning differences between data mining and machine learning and how they can be used.One key difference between machine learning and  is how they are used and applied in our everyday lives. For example, data mining is often used by machine learning to see the connections between relationships. Uber uses machine learning to calculate ETAs for rides or meal delivery times for UberEATS.Data mining can be used for a variety of purposes, including financial research. Investors might use data mining and web scraping to look at a start-up’s financials and help determine if they want to offer to fund. A company may also use data mining to help collect data on sales trends to better inform everything from marketing to inventory needs, as well as to secure new leads. Data mining can be used to comb through social media profiles, websites, and digital assets to compile information on a company’s ideal leads to start an outreach campaign. Using data mining can lead to 10,000 leads in 10 minutes. With this much information, a data scientist can even predict future trends that will help a company prepare well for what customers may want in the months and years to come.Machine learning embodies the principles of data mining, but can also make automatic correlations and learn from them to apply to new algorithms. It’s the technology behind self-driving cars that can quickly adjust to new conditions while driving. Machine learning also provides instant recommendations when a buyer purchases a product from Amazon. These algorithms and analytics are constantly meant to be improving, so the result will only get more accurate over time. Machine learning isn’t artificial intelligence, but the ability to learn and improve is still an impressive feat.Banks are already using and investing in machine learning to help look for fraud when credit cards are swiped by a vendor. CitiBank invested in global data science enterprise Feedzai to identify and eradicate financial fraud in real-time across online and in-person banking transactions. The technology helps to rapidly identify fraud and can help retailers protect their financial activity.Collecting data is only part of the challenge; the other part is making sense of it all. The right software and tools are needed to be able to analyze and interpret the huge amounts of information data scientists collect and find recognizable patterns to act upon. Otherwise, the data would largely be unusable unless data scientists could devote their time to looking for these complex, often subtle, and seemingly random patterns on their own. And anyone even somewhat familiar with data science and data analytics knows this would be an arduous, time-consuming task.Businesses could use data to shape their sales forecasting or determine what types of products their customers really want to buy. For example, Walmart collects point of sales from over 3,000 stores for its data warehouse. Vendors can see this information and use it to identify buying patterns and guide their inventory predictions and processes for the future.It’s true that data mining can reveal some patterns through classifications and sequence analysis. However, machine learning takes this concept a step further by using the same algorithms data mining uses to automatically learn from and adapt to the . As malware becomes an increasingly pervasive problem, machine learning can look for patterns in how data in systems or the cloud is accessed. Machine learning also looks at patterns to help identify which files are actually malware, with a high level of accuracy. All this is done without the need for constant monitoring by a human. If abnormal patterns are detected, an alert can be sent out so action can be taken to prevent the malware from spreading.Both data mining and machine learning can help improve the accuracy of the data collected. However, data mining and how it’s analyzed generally pertains to how the data is organized and collected. Data mining may include using extracting and scraping software to pull from thousands of resources and sift through data that researchers, data scientists, investors, and businesses use to look for patterns and relationships that help improve their bottom line.One of the primary foundations of machine learning is data mining. Data mining can be used to extract more accurate data. This ultimately helps refine your machine learning to achieve better results. A person may miss the multiple connections and relationships between data, while machine learning technology can pinpoint all of these moving pieces to draw a highly accurate conclusion to help shape a machine’s behavior. can enhance relationship intelligence in CRM systems to help sales teams better understand their customers and make a connection with them. Combined with machine learning, a company’s CRM can analyze past actions that lead to a conversion or customer satisfaction feedback. It can also be used to learn how to predict which products and services will sell the best and how to shape marketing messages to those customers.The future is bright for data science as the amount of data will only increase. By 2020, our accumulated digital universe of data will grow from , as reported by Forbes. We’ll also create 1.7 megabytes of new information every second for every human being on the planet.As we amass more data, the demand for advanced data mining and machine learning techniques will force the industry to evolve in order to keep up. We’ll likely see more overlap between data mining and machine learning as the two intersect to enhance the collection and usability of large amounts of data for analytics purposes.According to reporting from Bio-IT World, the future of data mining points to predictive analysis, as we’ll see advanced analytics across industries like medical research. Scientists will be able to use predictive analysis to look at factors associated with disease and predict which treatment will work the best.We’re just scratching the surface of what machine learning can do and how it will spread to help scale our analytical abilities and improve our technology. According to reporting from Geekwire, as our billions of machines become connected, everything from hospitals to factories to highways can be improved with IoT technology that can learn from other machines.But some experts have a different idea about data mining and machine learning altogether. Instead of focusing on their differences, you could argue that they both concern themselves with the same question: “How we can learn from data?” At the end of the day, how we acquire and learn from data is really the foundation for emerging technology. It’s an exciting time not just for data scientists but for everyone that uses data in some form.To find out more about Data Mining, check out this article discussing the difference between Data Mining and .", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/affiliate-programs/what-is-the-difference-between-data-mining-and-machine-learning.html"},

Scraping the Internet for massive amounts of data requires a great deal of knowledge to do effectively and efficiently, which is why many businesses hire firms that specialize in web scraping.", "word-count": 1079, "body": "Data is a crucial asset that will continue to unfold the way businesses engage with potential prospects. Today data is the only factor that can strive for a brand to engage in the way their potential prospects expect from them. Data doesn’t just provide a solution to brands on the prospect’s exact needs, it also guides them towards how that need can be resolved.Web scraping is the process of  or other source of information. The action is conducted because data isn’t that easily available. The online platform has pools of information that may or may not be easily accessible. Data that is accessible however cannot be downloaded.Interesting Read: Living in a generation where any queries are resolved with a tap of a button, conducting manual copy-pasting can be tiresome and honestly very time-consuming. The reason for data capture is easily interpreted for instance the need to sustain business growth, to find out about market conditions, to have a minute sense of predictions in the product growth and the list can go on.Web scraping isn’t a task for the technical or individuals who indulge in coding. Today a normal individual like you and I can conduct efficient web scraping activities anytime, anywhere. To conduct web scraping activities, the process includes 3 easy steps:1. Click on the website or the source of information you want to extract2. The scraping process commences3. The data is then saved in your system in the format you wish to see it in, for instance, CSV file.In simpler terms, web scraping is required to capture data. As you know that for any brand to cater to their prospect’s needs, they first need to understand what the needs are in the first place. Similarly, whenever brands tend to conduct any action which is stressed more on lead driven activities, such actions need to be conducted with the right data in hand.The online platform has data but not all of that data is relevant to you or might be some of the data that you are looking to retrieve may only be available on your competitor’s website or other brands website. You may be able to see it but you cannot constantly drive up to the screen each time you need that information right?And as mentioned, copy-pasting is a decades-old tactic. If a brand aims to sell quicker and better prospects, having the right data and incorporating it at the right time on their solution can spark conversion rates higher which is exactly why web scraping is required.Interesting Read: There are tens and thousands of data available online but not all that data is relevant to help your business grow. As a brand you know what is required for your brand’s enrichment and hence with web scraping, extracting only that portion of essential  that can help brands succeed faster in their lead capture activities. For instance, if you want to scrape data from your competitor’s websites, web scraping makes that happen without the competitor’s website slowing down or having any risk of any brand conducting this action to be detected.A brand can enhance its solution when it has the right data which exhibits the requirements needed to improvise the solution. Web scraping provides accurate data because all the data being driven is from sources that have been following it or from platforms where prospects have mentioned their opinion on their expectations about a particular product. All of this contributes a valuable  to brands which can help them to improvise their solution better. Since brands have an analysis of what their prospects are expecting, it becomes easier to adapt to the modifications and also plan out the next possible changes before the new trend hits.A brand success can only be retained when a band continues to serve the needs of all its prospects even with each changing trend. But how can that happen when the trends have no time of their arrival? With the data collected, brands can have an idea, it might not be the exact prediction but a simple analysis of how their solution will be looked upon a few years from now. Not only that aspect, but brands can also have an analysis of how their prospects will look at a product.For instance, maybe the current product offered by a brand is great, it has all the features and the prices are great, with web scraping you can get data which will help you analyze what more are prospects looking from the product for instance maybe they want few features to be automated or they want a specific feature and so on.  ensures that you get the data that can help you still cater to the prospect’s needs no matter the changes and still retain the success crown for longer.The harsh truth is if you want to be successful, outselling your competitors can win you over some brownie points. With web scraping, you can easily scrape any information which will most likely help your brand to hover in front of your competitors. It could be their pricing strategies, their prospect reviews, and any other information which will most likely help in catering to your very own prospect needs.The market is growing and changing all the time when it comes to conducting activities which can pull your brand closer to assisting their needs better, web scraping is an ideal  for that action to take place.To capture the ideal lead for a brand, it takes up a lot of research time to find the right audience which fits a brand’s target audience. Wouldn’t it be easier if you could just have a list that consists of the leads which can be interested in what your brand has to offer? Web scraping lets this happen. There are moments where you find leads in the most unimagined places, for instance, your blog post comments, or if someone has shared your post and even leads can be found within your peers activities as well such as their engagement sections of the individuals they interact with openly online, all these prospects stand as a potential sales lead for your brand.With the help of web scraping, you can easily scrape such information, get their contact details as well as email addresses without breaking a sweat and conduct efficient cold calling and emailing on the spot.

The era of #bigdata is here, and more companies than ever before are seeking to utilize it.", "word-count": 505, "body": "Collecting and analyzing data plays a crucial role in the digital marketing world. So many businesses and enterprises emphasizing  that’s why it’s important to take a closer look at the forms that data come in. Basically, there are two types of data that businesses usually collect. They are structured and unstructured data and these two make up the sum of an organization’s data collection.Therefore, both these types of data are essential in the modern digital enterprise; however, you must learn to manage them differently. This article will help you understand the difference between these two. So, keep reading to get the most out of both of them. Let’s tackle them one by one.As the word structure itself suggests the data which is highly organized and neatly formatted. It is a type of data which can be put into table and spreadsheets. This data is also referred to as quantitative data. Most businesses collect transactional data as structured data which includes financial information that meets compliance standards. The best example of  is Consumer data.Some more examples included in structured data are credit card numbers, financial amounts, dates, phone numbers, addresses, product names, etc.As the word indicates, unstructured data isn’t organized or properly formatted. It is a significant challenge to collect, process, and analyze unstructured data. The unstructured data is also called qualitative data which covers everything that structured data doesn’t. Unstructured data grows larger every year and it becomes difficult for companies to manage.Some examples of unstructured : reports, audio, files, text files, social media comments, and opinions, emails, and many more.From the above information, the differences between structured and unstructured data should become clear. Structured data is easy to gather, analyze, and store while unstructured data is unorganized and requires more work to properly investigate. Unstructured data also covers a lot more ground than the structured variety, with many more examples that are only growing as the internet continues to expand.In a sense, unstructured data is similar to how we as humans process and analyze information. If you have a conversation with someone, all the information that is conveyed is done so in an unorganized fashion. Despite this, we’re still able to digest that data and understand it. Structured data, on the other hand, is more in line with how computers process data. It’s neatly organized and easy to analyze. Being able to analyze unstructured data through computer processes then becomes the challenge.From the above points or explanations, the difference between structured data and unstructured data must be clear now. Structured data is easy to collect, analyze, and store. And unstructured data is unorganized and requires more work to properly analyze and investigate. However, for the overall success of the organization, enterprises need to properly and effectively analyze all of their data, irrespective of the source of the type. You must know the difference between these two so that you can effectively use them in your marketing strategy.We will be back with another interesting article till then get in touch with us and keep reading.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/affiliate-programs/structured-vs-unstructured-data-getting-to-know-the-difference.html"},

Or if you had already begun your affiliate marketing business but find that it is not giving you the desired results.I have put together a list of 4 affiliate marketing programs for aspiring and underperforming affiliates.", "word-count": 1062, "body": "For you that have yet to start any affiliate marketing business than this article would be able to benefit you as you have yet to make any financial commitment to it. It is recommended that you go through these 4 programs and see which fits your needs the best. Stick to it till fruition. There are a few benefits of starting your business with affiliate marketing that is worth mentioning:However if you had already begun your affiliate marketing business but find that it is not giving you the desired results. Or if you have written articles for your blog or website and have inserted your affiliate product links in your posts but have yet to see any sales or traffic, than my advice would be to bear patience and not to give up. Affiliate marketing is a business and with all businesses, it requires time for the business model to gain traction and yield results.What you will need to do though is to take a closer look at what is working or not working for you. One of the reason that you are in this situation would also be the choice of affiliate partner that you are working with. The other could be your work ethics and the realistic amount of effort that you are putting in your business as against the results that you expect.You would need to reconcile the 2 above reasons and make an evaluation if your current affiliate partner is right for you as not all of them are. At times, by just changing the affiliate partner you would able to see the results that you expect come to fruition.I have put together a list of 4 affiliate marketing programs for aspiring and underperforming affiliates. First Recommendation: Amazon has more than 20 million different product in their inventory. This makes them a very diverse affiliate partner that is able to provide you with any product from any topic or niche that you choose to specialize on. It also does not matter what the product that you are marketing, which for example could be a juice blender valued at $50/- and the customer that had used your affiliate link ended up buying a laptop for $2000/-, you would still receive the commission. This was possible owing to the cookie that is tagged to your affiliate link. So as long as the cookie is valid, you still get the commission regardless. However you would have to keep in mind that all cookies have a specific lifespan. Some are for as long as 60 days, some at 30 days and less.Although in the case of Amazon, they do not keep the cookies on for very long but their ability to get a purchase out of a visitor due to their sheer size in product line puts the odds in your favour to earn a commission. You could also promote Amazon verticals which is an added bonus. You are able to market Amazon Video, Amazon Prime and many others which is able to generate you commissions when your visitor signs up to take up the free trial. It is always great to give things away for free if it does not cost you anything.Second Recommendation: This marketing program offers quite a lucrative commissions cut. You would be able to earn 40% as an affiliate and if you are a contributor of a product you would be able to earn 70%. If you are able to recommend someone else to promote the bundles you would still earn from their sales. This is known as second-tier program.They also have an impressive range of products from almost all topics or niche and a comprehensive training program. They offer sales planners, webinars and conversion rate strategies in their training package available to you after you join their Facebook group. You also stand to win some really awesome prizes if you are the top few on their leader-board. It is definitely worth to try.    Third Recommendation: You can use your blog page to insert for affiliate products links. It is a fairly simple process where you post articles on a topic or niche of your interest and are passionate about and insert an affiliate link to a congruent product that you are recommending to your readers. If your blog is about weight loss, it would not make much sense to insert an affiliate link for laptop.  The people who visit your site would also be interested to know how to manage to make money from your blog site, they would be keen too. This is where you can insert a custom ads for the tools needed for someone to create their website or blog with your affiliate product link set in. In this way you will earn every time your visitor clicks on the ad. You will need to keep in mind to promote products and content of value which you would use yourself. Provide an honest review and build a rapport with your readers.    Recommendation 4: This is an affiliate program that carries 4000 affiliate programs. They provide very detailed terms and conditions for all the programs under their company. There are also about 1000 programs that you would not be able to elsewhere other than with Shareasale. This is an affiliate program that you should really consider joining.You can sign up with a few merchants to gauge what products works best for your readers/visitors. I will list 3 which you might want to consider signing up for. You must bear in mind to choose a product that is of interest to you and that you are passionate about. This is key as you would have to give your honest opinions on the products and to ensure that the product does help your reader/visitors. Your credibility is important in this business and your income is dependant of you being transparent and forthright with your audience. Choosing a product that is outside your interest would not be sustainable and reflect poorly of your authority as you would not be able to provide much information and insights about it. I wish you all the best. Thank you. 'Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.'-- Winston ChurchillI hope that you have found this article helpful.

When used effectively, it can be used to analyze social media streams and gauge public opinion. It can help you gather information on different aspects of the business as shown below.Sentiment Analysis is simply gauging the feelings behind a piece of content or the attitude towards a piece of content whether it’s an article, comment, or . At the most basic level, sentiment-analysis classify pieces of text as positive, negative, or neutral.        There are different types of sentiment analysis. And, each of it helps your business in a different way- some help you find the emotion, while some the intention of your customers. Each of these will help you get closer to your customers and help in increasing your return on investment.This is not about bucketing the sentiments of your customers into positive, negative, or neutral but ranking them with the level of positivity and negativity.There are 5 categories:Very positivePositiveNeutralNegativeVery negativeVery positive is ranked 5, positive is ranked 4, neutral is 3, negative is 2 and very negative is ranked 1, they help in determining the heights of the feeling a customer has towards your product.Emotion detection is used to determine emotions such as anger, happiness, sadness, etc. Emotion detection systems use lexicons which is a list of words/emoticons that convey meaning. This helps you to quickly know what the mood of the customer is. Most often, customers might not give you feedback when you ask them to type in a text box.This is used to analyze a specific feature of the product and not how the customer feels about the product as a whole. This allows you to concentrate on developing the areas that the customer feels there is a scope of improvement. For example, let us say you are buying a phone, the customer likes all the aspects of it, except for the front camera which may/may not be the key feature. feedback on that will help you improve and widen your target audience.It is a process of getting feedback from customers of different languages and then analyzing them to get feedback.

Now, the reason why the review said that could be anything. But, the human brain will not get into the nuances of it. Although the review is not specific to anything there are high chances that one could ignore the property and choose a different one.In the same example, if the owner has replied back to the thread, either giving a valid reason or asking for more information, then there are chances that you might consider.

It gives you a room to show them that you are responsible for the business that you are doing.Tracking customer sentiment is better than calculating the NPS (Net Promoter Score) of your product? It helps you in understanding why the score of your NPS has changed or the factors aligned to how things have changed.It helps in understanding the different segments of your business. For example, what do people with a certain income base feel about your product? Is your product priced too much for them? How can you deliver at a rate that is affordable for them or how much would they be willing to pay for the service that you offer? You can also understand the behavior of the customers from this, such as why are returns from a certain area too high?As the business plan changes so do customer sentiment. Let us assume that you have revamped your entire site, or released a new user interface, this will definitely have an effect on the customer sentiment. How would your customers feel when they have been using an interface for years now and one day they log in to find a new user interface? Some might like it, while some may find it difficult.

To sell to customers on the internet, you would have to build a bond with them for them to trust you and like you before you are able to recommend a solution or product/service to them for consideration. This concept is termed as permission based marketing.", "word-count": 2074, "body": "The first thing that most aspiring affiliate marketers do at the start of their online business is to create a marketing website. It can a traditional website or a blog site. But the preferred choice of most is the blog site because of its interactive medium. Your visitors/readers are able to offer their comments and be seen by other readers/visitor too, this flexibility and highly interactive come of communication is the foundation of internet marketing which is to build bonds and foster relationships with your reader/visitor. This concept of information marketing is what works best on the on the internet as your potential customers are not able to see your products on display publicly as you would find in a conventional store. To sell to customers on the internet, you would have to build a bond with them for them to trust you and like you before you are able to recommend a solution or product/service to them for consideration. This concept is termed as permission based marketing. It is with this permission that was granted by the visitor/reader that you will be able to send them sales email as well as content of value periodically. The products/service that you recommend can be created or produced by you or like in most cases is the inventory of an affiliate partner. The affiliate partner is a company that offers affiliate programs to individuals to market and sell their products/services. The affiliates earn a commission for every sale that they make through their affiliate product link.    The advantage of being on an affiliate program is that the company does all the heavy lifting. The company handles the buying and storing of the inventory. They will also handle the packaging and delivery of the product that are sold by the affiliates and also follow up with the customers for any sales and service issues. As an affiliate, your job is done as soon as the payment is transacted. This is why the majority of internet marketers do affiliate marketing.    Let us now take a look the 7 steps to create a marketing website for an affiliate marketing business. The online business model works a little differently that an offline conventional business where you would just need to get a store and stock it with your inventory to sell. You can even have 200 different types of unrelated items to sell in your store. You can have alcoholic beverages on one shelf and infant formula milk on another. Your customer would not be confused by all the unrelated items as they are able to pick out specifically whatever that they need from the items on display. This works in the same way for big online retail giants such as Amazon. However as an affiliate marketer, your customers are people who are looking for specialized information of a certain problem or concern before deciding to buy. For example, a person search the internet for information on Keto Diet as he wants to lose weight would enter the keywords “Keto diet for weight loss” into the Google search box. Google will then provide him with a list of recommended sites to view. The searcher then browses through the list and decide which site to check out. This is called information based marketing. So in order for you to sell to a potential customer online, you will need to know the profile of your customer. What I have described in the above paragraph is your typical customer as an affiliate marketer. You are technically an information marketer. Taking the above Keto Diet example, as an information marketer you have to be very knowledgeable about Keto Diet and weight loss in general. The searcher goes on the internet to seek professional information on specifically his area of concern. The algorithm system in Google will pick out a list of sites with related keywords and provide it to the searcher. It would be ridiculous or rather impossible for Google to provide him with a list of sites for a search on Keto Diet that had included sites for pet grooming and tennis. You have to understand the concerns and the needs of your customers. So in choosing a market or niche you would need to be specific and it has to be something that you have a lot of interest in and are passionate about. You will also need to bear in mind that you will be doing a lot of writing and talking on this specific niche for as long as you want to sell the product online. Changing to a different niche 1 or 2 years after you have started would mean that all your effort for the past 1 to 2 years would have been wasted.      It is important that you should invest in your business. To create a marketing website and build a business is an investment that would provide you with the yield or rewards later. You should cultivate this mind-set from the start if you want to see your business grow and produce the intended results. I would recommend that you get a paid domain for your website or blog site. It is a relatively small investment of around $10/- for a domain name but this provides you with the peace of mind that all the hard work of several years building website would not just disappear or are missing some parts. In saying that you should invest in your business and pay for the services that you need does not mean that I am telling you to think big as you will be earning big money rather it is about safety and prudency of your business.  and  are but 2 of many domain name and hosting service providers on the internet.  is able to assist you with your website building platform. It is user friendly and would be able to get the job done quite easily. I have included this comprehensive video by my friend Wes McDowel for your easy reference.   The rule of thumb in looking for a popular product is that it must be related to your niche and also financially viable. You need to do a little research in looking for a product to market or promote on your site. The affiliate programs offers you an easy way to look for the products that are related to your niche or market. There are 2 types of products that you can choose to market which is a physical product or a digital product. The difference between the 2 products are the commissions that they pay out. If you choose a physical product to market, you will need to find a popular high priced product as physical products tend to have a commissions pay out of between 4 to 10%. The digital products have a higher commissions pay out between 70 to 90%. Do not be swayed by choosing a high ticket product just because of the commissions, rather choose it because it is popular. This means that other affiliate marketers have sold many of the same product and it is well received by the market. There are more than 15,000 affiliate programs available online to choose from. ,  and  are a few of the well-known brands. All the affiliate programs will come with all the marketing material, tutorials and affiliate support service to help and guide you.        The autoresponder service for the purpose of delivering sales email and content of value to your subscribers. The service is fully automated and once you have set it up will continue to send the series of sales email and follow up messages and help you to build rapport and relationship with your prospects from your subscribers list. These are the people who have permitted you to send them those emails. The series of sales email can be programed on your autoresponder to be sent out at scheduled intervals to your subscribers. You would need this service as it is very time consuming for you to manually send out that many emails to all your subscribers.  and  are a couple of popular autoresponder companies.   The subscriber list is compulsory to sustain your business. Running an online business without a subscribers list is akin to an insurance salesman trying to sell insurance without a client base. Your subscribers list is actually your client base. These are people who have agreed to receive your sales emails and product recommendations. You can build your subscribers list by creating a squeeze page or inserting an email capture form on your blog page or website. The squeeze page or email capture form is the means for you to interest the visitor/reader to provide their email address in exchange for a free e-book or e-zine. This is called an opt-in process. The free e-book and e-zines will usually be provided for you in the affiliate program. The subscribers list would then be stored in your autoresponder database and this is where your communication with them begin. It is highly unlikely that a prospect would buy from you on the first instance so by maintaining and continuing to communicate with them via email, it will eventually foster a relationship in which they would begin to know and trust you.     To create a marketing website you would also need content. Your website or blog site have to carry content related to your niche so that your visitor is able to know that you are a person with specialized knowledge on the area of concern or problem. This is where you would be able to provide your expert advice, share tips and information of value on the subject matter. Please keep in mind that the information has to help your reader with his concern otherwise he would leave and in the long run, you would end up losing a lot of traffic this way. You can write articles and come up with content of quality by following this simple guide;   To create a marketing website or blog site you would need traffic. It is the lifeblood of your online business. This is where your potential customers would be from. Running a business on the internet without traffic is akin to opening a store in a shopping mall with all doors to the malls locked up. As a result there will be no shoppers coming into the mall and you might as well just close your store. There are 2 methods that you can do this, the free method and the paid method. It is recommended that you have one paid and one free method. You can generate traffic to your blog /website by using a strategy called the SEO (Search Engine Optimization). The SEO is a tool for you to drive the targeted readers/audience to your blog/website. You need to understand a little bit of how this actually works in order for you to implement the strategy effectively. The on page SEO works on the  and to do this you would need to optimize all your articles, comments, videos and pictures to be in line with the keywords. You can get the keywords related to your topic or niche by using the keyword search free sites available on the internet. The list of keywords would give you a good indication of what long tail keywords to use for your articles, comments, videos and pictures. The off page SEO is a strategy is another means that you can use to give your blog site more exposure and help drive up traffic. You can invite experienced bloggers to write guest posts on your website and this would mean a better content for your readers. It will also benefit the guest writer. This method is excellent in keeping the interest up with your readers/visitors. Networking in this way improves your rapport with other bloggers too. Learning how to create a marketing website and ensuring it succeeds requires you to have the right attitude and mind-set from the onset. You should put in your efforts diligently and consistently for you to attain success. It is the same in the offline conventional business as well. I wish you all the best and I hope that the article was helpful to you.

For instance: a real estate broker facilitating the sale of a property. Click here for more information about Forex Trading.Brokers can also provide considerable market information on prices, products, and market conditions. Brokers can represent either the seller or the buyer, but it is not possible to represent both at the same time.For an example broker who buys or sells shares on behalf of his client. Today, brokers are playing a key role in buying/selling stocks, bonds, futures, currencies, and other financial services.Before, only the rich could afford the services of an intermediary to access markets. However, the Internet has enabled the emergence of online brokers (discount agents), which allow investors to operate at a lower cost, although they do not offer any personalized advice (only in some cases).Before opening an account with a broker and paying for their services, whatever market the investor is going to invest in, it is important to take the time to research what the best options are for these companies or individuals. You have to study on top brokers or  before starting Forex business. For an example, if you want to invest in the US stock market, you must go to a properly regulated and accredited broker that complies with the strict financial services regulations of that country.On the other hand, if a trader is interested in the Forex market, then he should choose a broker that has a good reputation, and is also registered and regulated by one of the major ones. Major financial regulators in Europe or the United States, in this case.How do Forex brokers work?Brokers usually have an advanced trading position in the market. It is worth noting that a forex brokerage is an entity that connects retail forex traders with the forex market.The Forex market is traded on the 'interbank' market, which is a fancy way of saying that banks electronically trade with each other at various prices that can change from bank to bank.This is how Forex brokers make their money, taking a slice of the cake when you trade. There are changes in the relationship between two currencies that are measured in pips.When you place a trade, the Forex broker charges you a few pips before putting your trade on the market (this is a regular action). For an example, the market could trade at 1.3100 EUR/USD as the purchase price, and upon entering your trade the broker can put it at 1.3102.If you close your trade immediately, the Forex broker collects the profit between the 'market price' and the price you paid (this is known as a spread).You might be wondering why the Forex broker would choose such a small item to make money? The easy answer is that most people don't think about a couple of pips apart when they are trading.A discount broker is a company that charges small commissions by allowing the execution of clients' transactions in the market using computerized trading systems (the electronic trading platforms that many intermediaries currently use) rather than using the services of an agent or human intermediary to place orders in the market.In these days, most traditional brokers compete strongly to attract customers' attention and their money by quickly switching to this cheaper and more efficient trading method in the markets.Currently, most Forex brokers are marketed as online brokers, offering their clients the ability to trade the Forex market from anywhere, just with an internet connection through a trading platform.  can play a vital role to choose the best brokers in this market perfectly. It allows these companies to provide a service at fairly low costs compared to other markets. A similar trend is being observed in other markets, such as stocks or futures, where brokers orient their services towards online trading platforms.Another way that some brokers use to cut costs is by executing orders only a few times a day, aggregating the orders of a large number of small investors into one or more trading blocks that are created at specific times during the day. This allows them to reduce costs in two ways.In the case of stockbrokers, for example, since investors' money is pooled prior to the purchase or sale of shares, this conversely allows them to contribute relatively small amounts of money with which fractional shares can be acquired of specific actions. This is not usually possible with a regular broker.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/affiliate-programs/what-is-an-online-forex-broker.html"},

Many people have realised that one of the best ways to make money online is via the route of being an Affiliate Marketer. There are plenty of good programs out there and joining one would be a good start to guide you with the process of setting up. The program will have training modules for you to acquire the knowledge you require to set up your affiliate marketing business. Getting additional help by way of these tips that I am sharing with you will smoothen your road to success.The whole process if quite straightforward as you are actually the middle man between the affiliate merchant and the customer. You do this by generating traffic to the merchant’s affiliate link or to your own site. You would earn commission for every sale that a customer makes. Basically it is a number game where you will increase your chance of making a sale by getting as much traffic. These tips would provide you with a better understanding on the some of the best practices starting out in this business.   1.    Choosing your niche/market.  A common mistake that new affiliates make is to go for the highest commission product to sell. While it is a logical choice in terms of the financial gain in promoting a big ticket item but the interest will be short lived as you will be discouraged by the lack of sales you are making and unmotivated to push on. You must only choose a product or service from a niche/market that you are passionate and interested about and it has to be financially viable for you to promote. You cannot change this midway as the consequence is that you will need to start everything from ground zero.   It would not make much sense for you to promote an e-book on gaming when you know very little knowledge and interest in it. You can chose something that you might have little knowledge about but you are passionate and interested in it. You can build the knowledge of your niche as you go along. Remember there is a lot of work that you would need to put in to promote an online business and you need to keep up the efforts before the business reach fruition.   2.    Do your due diligence on the affiliate program.  You will need to exercise due diligence in choosing an affiliate program which is best suited for you. For a new marketer, you would need to choose an affiliate program that is having a good support and service component in place for new marketers. Starting out can be very difficult if you do not have the support and service to help get started and set everything up. Read up on the reviews of the program by the members in the program, pay attention to the help that they have got from the program merchant when they had problems in the start-up stages. You do not want to mess things up at the setting up stage as it would halt the rest of business from moving forward.   3.    Choose a marketing technique.   All the affiliate program will teach you many different ways that you can do to market the product or service. You have a wide selection to choose from but all the techniques are divided into 2 clear categories. Free and Paid. On the internet promoting or marketing a product essentially means directing traffic. So, the traffic from paid techniques are known as paid traffic and the former as organic traffic. In terms of quality, organic traffic is a lot higher than paid traffic. The difference is basically the conversion rate or the sales that you make from these 2 different traffic. Organic traffic produce better sales. 'There is a powerful driving force inside every human being that, once unleashed, can make any vision, dream, or desire a reality.'-- Anthony RobbinsI hope that you have found this article helpful. . I would very much appreciate it if you could drop me your valuable inputs and comments please Thank you.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/affiliate-programs/tips-for-anyone-wanting-to-make-money-online-as-an-affiliate-marketer.html"},

You may not even believe that you can find a good vehicle and a deal. But it is entirely possible to buy perfect cars that have been pre-owned. All you need to do is consider a few things before finalizing the deal. Here are 3 top tips to buy a used car. 1.    Spend time in research prior to visiting a dealership.It is not a good idea to simply step into a dealership unless you know something about it or if you found it via a trusted source. Look for dealerships in your area by using your location in the online search keyword. One good example is Used Cars in Madison Heights, VA. It contains both the requirement and the location. Conduct further research on the top results. Visit their websites. Check their social pages and online reviews. The website is a good place to check a dealership’s inventory. Most reputed dealerships maintain an online inventory with all the details to help their existing and potential customers. You can view it to check if a dealership is worth your while. The inventory must contain clear pictures and detailed descriptions of the vehicles. You should also be able to search for your preference by mentioning the right make, model, fuel type, etc. The social accounts and online reviews must contain mostly positive reviews of the dealerships. Otherwise; it’s not worth your while. It is best to not pay attention to a negative review here and there. 2.    Assess the quality of the cars during your in-person visit to the dealership.Identify at least one good dealership in your area with the help of due research as mentioned above. Visit the dealership to check the cars available there upfront and close. Don’t hesitate to ask the representative assisting you with any questions you may have about the vehicle, after-sales services, or securing spare motor parts in the future.  It is best to seek after-sales services from the same dealership for the best workmanship. They will have genuine motor components and expert mechanics to service the cars. Don’t forget to test drive every car you like. 3.    Take time to review if you have doubts about a car. If you are torn between two models or unsure about a vehicle, take time to review your choices rather than make a hasty decision. Pay more heed to the quality than the pricing. A used car should last you for many years to come. If its quality is good, you should be able to drive it for many good years. Any good dealership is likely to offer you attractive pricing on the cars. You can always work out the best price with the sales executive. But the quality of the car will remain the same (after all improvements have been done on it).Once you are sure of your selection, buy the car without delay.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/autos/what-are-the-three-top-tips-to-buy-a-used-car.html"},

Your efficient driving habits will contribute to the smooth functioning of your engine so that you do not have to replace them before time.Here is what you must not do if you want your engine to run longer:Frequent Harsh And Sudden BrakingWe all have given extremely rough and sudden jolts to a car when for no good reason a car stops moving right in front of us. If this case is repeated more frequently, you are causing major harm to your car.Of course, this sudden braking is going to result in eventual wear out of your brakes. But if you continue to do this more often, it will affect your engine as well. When you slam the brakes, it causes the engine parts to transition into positions which are unnatural whereas normal braking allows the moving parts to take the right position in order to stop the car.Shifting The Gears Before The Engine Is ReadyIf you are shifting too early, the damage you are doing to the engine will cost you a lot more than you can imagine. The early shifting usually happens when you are moving between drive and reverse. If you do not completely stop your car before shifting, there is one habit you immediately need to change.If you do this more frequently, it can cause you to damage the drivetrain which is a part that controls the steering and wheels. The parts which are most affected due to this driving habit are not readily accessible and hence even more expensive to replace.Running Your Car On Low FluidsIf you know your car well, we don’t have to tell you the number of fluids it functions on. Make sure that the fuel, coolant, oil, wiper fluid, transmission fluid, power steering fluid and brake fluids are not too low. Most importantly, the engine should not only have enough oil but also one with good quality. Bad engine oil will hamper good functioning of the engine and so will the lack of other fluids.Frequent Slamming On The AcceleratorIf you are pushing the accelerator way too harsh and quick, you are in for significant damage. Accelerating too quickly will cause your car to roughly rush through the gears. Give your engine a good time to transition to avoid sudden jerking in your car.Do Not Cramp Your Car With The Unbearable WeightIf you feel your car is spacious enough to fit half of your house in it, you do not necessarily have too. Excess weight on the car is also extremely damaging. It will not only harm the suspension system and wheels. Too much weight will be strenuous on the engine of your car. The engine will be too worked out if your car is profusely heavy to drive. Make sure you know that your car has a weight limit and you must abide by it at all costs.Driving On A Bleak TireDo not ignore the air pressure in your tires. Your tires could leak or lose air pressure for various reasons. If you are not keeping a check on them, driving on tires with low air pressure can cause damage to your car. While its major effect will be seen on the tires and wheels, the engine doesn’t stay left out. Driving a car on low air-pressure in tires will cause the engine to put extra effort into running your car. The strain might result in a damaged car engine.Driving On Rough RoadsAs exciting as off-roading sounds, it is not the best activity for the engine of your car unless you have the budget to replace it frequently. The bumps, cracks, potholes and dips can cause unnatural movements in the engine. Not to forget how majorly it can damage the wheels and the suspension system as well.Not Noticing Check Engine Lights While DrivingYou might notice a lot of check engine lights on your dashboard. If there is anything wrong with your engine, these lights are supposed to indicate the cause of the problem. If you avoid checking the engine lights on the dashboard, you might lead your engine to an even bigger mid-drive crisis. If you see these lights blinking to indicate any minor damage, the best solution is to get your car checked by a professional mechanic.Exploiting The ClutchIf you drive a manual transmission car, you might have to be more careful than the rest. A manual transmission car requires you to be extremely gentle on the clutch as well as the gears. Make sure you are not grinding the gear stick. Transition smoothly to avoid causing any damage to your car. You must also no put even a little pressure on the clutch while driving.Even though we hope you are more careful with your car, there will come a time when your engine will need a replacement. You can either buy a brand new one or save some money by purchasing  from auto recyclers. These used auto parts do not only function well but save you a great deal of cash.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/autos/avoid-these-driving-habits-to-grant-your-engine-a-longer-life.html"},
{"heading": "Cost Factors of Shipping Your Car", "author": "Rayanne Morriss", "description": "How much is the car transport cost and what factors affect it? This is one of the most frequently asked questions when the time comes for shipping your car. Right off the bat, you’ll want to set the shipping date as far in advance as possible, this’ll ensure lower cost from the get-go.", "word-count": 762, "body": "How much is the car transport cost and what factors affect it? This is one of the most frequently asked questions when the time comes for shipping your car. Right off the bat, you’ll want to set the shipping date as far in advance as possible, this’ll ensure lower cost from the get-go. The main factors (though not the only factors) in determining what it’ll cost is trip distance, car size (sedan, pickup truck, SUV, etc.), vehicle condition (operable or inoperable), transport type (open or enclosed), location (i.e. rural or urban), and the time of year when you ship. The truth is there is no universal price. The cost is on a case by case basis and there are a lot of variables when it comes to your situation and the needs therein. The following is a list of factors that you can take into account.Trip distance is one of the main factors affecting the shipping cost. Longer distances tend to mean higher prices. Make sure the company you go with has a shipping calculator for you to get a quick and accurate quote. Moving to or from a large urban center with a high population will mean you will be charged more for the car shipping, whereas smaller cities and rural areas mean a cheaper price. If your city is too costly, you can always try arranging to meet the driver outside the city limits to see if that is cheaper. Sometimes companies will offer a discounted cost per mile deal for especially long trips, so keep that in mind. Also, keep in mind that international shipping costs have an entirely different scale for pricing.The make and model of your car will play a big part in determining the cost. Obviously, the larger your car is, the more space and adjustments involved in transport it’s going to need. Custom modifications like roof racks, large tires, spoilers can also play a part in this. If you have a super tricked out car, make sure you get a hold of a representative that can take your specifications into account so that you get the most accurate quote. You also want to make sure it’s able to even fit onto the trailer!Depending on the company, whether or not your car is in working condition may play a factor in the quote. If your car starts with proper steering and braking it can easily be loaded and unloaded. But if it’s inoperable, it should at least be able to be rolled and pushed, though this may require the use of more equipment on the part of the company, and thus more cost. If your car requires a forklift or other even heavier machinery, well, you can see where that will take you price-wise.The type of car you have will affect your decision on what kind of transportation you prefer. Open-air transport is the typical kind you see loaded onto semi-trucks on the highways. But if you have a luxury or a vintage car, you may want to opt for an enclosed service. This can be crucial in protecting your vehicle against weather factors and other hazards on the road like flying rocks and debris. This may be especially useful if you know the route of the delivery will be going through areas with some intense weather or rough terrain. Keep in mind that enclosed transport will entail a higher price.Considering what time of year you’re looking to ship can be a big factor. What are the rates to and from your areas in the winter as opposed to the summer? Sometimes it can be counterintuitive. For instance, transportation to a sunny state may seem like it would be cheap, but if it’s coming from a snowy state, then demand is higher during that time, and thus prices will go up. This is why it’s important to get a quote as far in advance as possible to consider these scenarios. When looking into a company to find out their , you should check references from other clients. Make sure to ask about the company's experience with moving cars and the different types of cars. What are their shipping prices compared to other companies, and how long does an average delivery usually take to complete?If they have a long list of satisfied clients or have references, it may be an indication that the company is reputable and can get the job done quickly. You should also check with your local Better Business Bureau to see if there are any complaints against the company you are considering using.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/autos/cost-factors-of-shipping-your-car.html"},

There is a different type of window tints available in the market according to the material used in the manufacturing or as per the requirement of the users. However, broadly window tints can be divided into two categories; reflective window tints and non-reflective window tints.  Generally, both types of tints are a great observer of heat and glares. The non-reflective window tints are made up of dyed material which helps in observing the heat. However, this dyed material isn’t as effective as the reflective window tints on observing the solar heat.  In addition to these two types of windows, tints can be categorized according to the material used in the manufacturing of tints. On the basis of material, tints are divided into three categories; dyed material, carbon mixed, and ceramic window tints. Out of these three dyed window tint options- dyed window tints are more cost-effective whereas ceramic  is costly.  That’s because ceramic tints offer the highest level of heat reflection features.  Apart from all these window film types, there is one other type of film that is very popular these days. Such as nano carbon ceramic, an innovative new hybrid of both carbon and ceramic, combines the benefits of both parent types while minimizing the drawbacks, making this a favorite choice among car owners who want longevity and good function.  Features of Window TintsSo, if you are ready to install the tints on your brand new car or want to replace your old tints, then get the window tints that will match the criteria of good quality tints.  Level of Shade - For car tints legally only a certain level of shading or darkness is allowed by the government.

This is because while driving the vehicle, you require a sheer amount of clarity and visibility.Useful Reading: Solar control - If you don’t want to feel too hot inside your car, then you should select the window tints with the solar control features. The extra heat is very dangerous for you and your car’s interior so always make sure that your tent has a good quality solar control system in it.  So, if your car window tint is designed on the above-mentioned criteria, then you are going to enjoy the full protection from the .

It was fuelled in Hollywood and spread to other corners of the world via social media which is always in discussions.", "word-count": 945, "body": "Although Harvey Weinstein is going to face worst judicial trials and severe conditions for a longer period of time yet only a few Hollywood people have the instinct of robust punishment of harassers. The #MeToo movement has shaken the foundations of every industry by rising doubts on every person included in misbehaviours towards women.The profound personality Anita Hill standing against sexual harassmentAnita Hill who has done a complete survey of how harassers will be treated? According to her survey, the chances are minute because people are less possibly taking this matter seriously. Though several people have lost their faiths in accountability of these condemned honours, yet a few are positive that the world will shift its direction towards conduction of serious tribunals against these to set an example for our forthcoming generations.Anita Hill and many other expert writers of  have reclaimed that there is a certain fraction of society believes in improvement of things but mot has assumed that if they appeal for justice in any case, they will not get impartiality from anywhere because lack of liability though conditions are better nowadays as compared to last few years. Besides, people in Hollywood have faiths that there will be extreme vengeance from surroundings which will create complications and hurdles for smooth crackdowns against harassers. They argue that in the absence of stringent tribunal system how there can be any listeners for their complaints.Alternatively, only about 10,000 people have answered in the true sense that only a few notorious harassers will be brought into the limelight by the group of society who are well-known and recognised all over the world. But it does not guarantee anything firm and comprehensive for victims looking forward to getting justice.Hollywood commission  In 2017, a Hollywood commission was brought into place against mischievous entities of society involved in sexual harassment. Most importantly, Weinstein initiated the never-ending debate and dispute of #MeToo when he was found to be guilty of sexual harassment. People reaction towards Weinstein misconduct was furious as everyone raised his voice for reprimanding such people of society who appeared as harassers. Anita Hill has been a permanent member of the commission since 1991 when she accused Clarence Thomas for sexually harassing her.A famous survey for inculcating harassment responses among masses The survey for acknowledging the responses of people was conducted on the internet in which 10,000 men and women took part and have given their consent about the matter.It led to the creation of a stringent platform for raising voices against such misconducts of certain evil-minded people in our community. Moreover, the survey and its report have unlocked new and weird things for the community which were behind the curtain for previous years because there were no such discussion platforms earlier.Some findings of the survey held by Anita HillThe deficiency of liability has raised concerns about the punishment of abusers as 48% of people could experience a positive change in the system to reveal such harassment cases.Most people about more than 40% have fears that they will be humiliated for telling atrocities which they have faced in life due to misconduct of black sheep of our society.She responded to an interview by shedding light on the issue of sexual harassment and keep silence on this matter. She had given a clear message to all victims that it is time to stand for their rights and justice. She acknowledged that battling against evil is not a child’s play as it takes huge struggle and humiliation to stay on the track for a longer time.Lack of a transparent reporting systemEvery one is not getting the news to get to know about the surroundings as there have been no such efficient reporting systems. People are not exchanging the right amount of information and data to unveils certain mysterious and secrets of dark hidden truths. But there are only a few such systems willing to bring truth in front of the whole world so that everyone can comprehend the dark side of the world. Likewise, she distinguished that the system is biased to some extent which allows standers with huge personalities exerting massive authority as Weinstein had performed.As per her sayings, power and authority have an obvious influence on the career of people in the industry. If some have strong backgrounds and support from the renowned faction, then surely he is likely to relish the fruits of being linked with a high authoritative representative for the time being. But rarely, you can find such people being brought forward for doing misconducts and being punished for what they have done.The liability brings hopes for people Hill has ascertained that the trust of people in our system gets upgraded as someone is being held liable for his doings because it creates a sense of calm and relief in the minds of people of society. Additionally, she has reminded the significance of surveys in our life and their role in pondering light on the most crucial matters of our world.It came as surprising for Anita Hill that people who are willing to contribute to the success of Hollywood have still faith for improvement of the industry as they are always appreciating the true aspects of the industry. Furthermore, according to her such people are constantly carrying industry forward to spread its influence all over the world.People who want to begin their careers in Hollywood know about difficulties and range of criticism under which they can come but still acknowledge the conduct of fair trials against evils of our society. But there are possibilities that there will be more percentage of people standing against sexual abusers to stop the cause of harassment in the society including Hollywood.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/awards/hollywood-got-faith-in-punishment-of-harassers.html"},

The shipbuilding industry condenses people's wisdom and hard work, is a symbol of the country's comprehensive national strength, and it also measures a country's status in the world's shipbuilding industry and ocean engineering.Application of steel pipes in ocean engineering:The application of steel pipes in ocean engineering is very common. There are roughly three types of steel pipes in the two major systems of shipbuilding and ocean engineering: conventional steel pipes, structural steel pipes and special-purpose steel pipes.1. Conventional steel pipeDifferent ships and marine engineering have both conventional systems and dedicated systems.The service life of a ship is generally 20 years. There are many conventional systems, mainly including bilge water, ballast, drainage, injection, domestic water, fire fighting, domestic sewage, air, measurement, cargo oil, stripping, ventilation, inert gas, heating, washing, foam fire extinguishing, Water sprinkling, vaporization, liquid level remote sensing, valve remote control and other systems. Special ships also include special systems for transporting liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG). The service life of steel pipes in marine engineering is at least 40 years. In addition to conventional systems in offshore engineering, there are also special drilling equipment systems, crude oil, liquefied petroleum gas, and liquefied natural gas processing process systems.According to statistics, it is found that the annual consumption of marine pipes reaches 5 million tons, about 500,000 pipes. The standards are GB, YB, CB, and 70% of the pipes are connected between them. The amount of steel pipes and fittings for a 300,000-ton ultra-large oil tanker can reach dozens of kilometers, and the amount of steel pipes (including) is about 1,000-1,500 tons. Of course, the amount of steel pipes used in the hull structure of 40,000 tons is still relatively limited. of. In addition, considering the same type of ship, multiple ships must be built, as well as many other ships. The number of 300,000-ton super large FPSO pipes exceeds 40,000, and the length exceeds 100 kilometers, which is 3-4 times that of the same tonnage. Therefore, the shipbuilding industry has become a large user of the steel pipe industry.2. Steel pipes for structural purposesIn the application of steel pipes in marine engineering, in addition to the above-mentioned conventional systems and special systems, many structures use a large number of steel pipes, such as jackets, risers, underwater steel piles, helicopter platforms, mooring brackets, and torch towers. This kind of steel pipe has many specifications and high materials, with the same diameter, different wall thickness, different diameter, and a large number of Y, K, T-shaped pipe joints. Their materials are E36-Z35, D36-Z35, E36, D36. The standard of this kind of steel pipe is not YB, CB, but mainly GB712-2000. The production of steel pipes is in accordance with the 'Structural Steel Pipe Manufacturing Code' SY/T10002-2000 formulated by the my country Petroleum Industry Standards and Technical Committee (CPSC). Since there is no specialized enterprise in our country, the steel plate is usually processed and formed by the construction unit after purchasing it.3. Special purpose steel pipeSpecial-purpose steel pipes refer to steel pipes used in specific working environments and working media.Among them, the submarine oil pipeline is a typical special steel pipe, which is in large demand, has the characteristics of high strength, good corrosion resistance, and small tolerances. At present, the production of submarine pipelines in my country is still in its infancy because of corrosion resistance, few welding materials or specifications, and high prices.Crude oil on the sea needs to be transported with insulation. In the past, the double-layer steel pipe insulation structure was used, which was safe and reliable. However, it is not economical to use steel pipes as protective pipes. Before offshore pipe laying operations, the inner and outer pipes must be welded, which greatly reduces the pipe laying efficiency and doubles the installation cost. increase. After entering the 21st century, people introduced a concrete counterweight steel pipe. Its structure is (from inside to outside): steel pipe, epoxy powder (FBE) anti-corrosion layer, polyethylene (PE) jacket pipe, polyurethane insulation layer, reinforced concrete counterweight layer (with steel wire mesh inside). This type of special steel pipes were imported from abroad by China. For example, the first phase of the Penglai 19-3 oilfield project in Bohai Sea uses the products of the Malaysian Bredero Pric company.After research and testing, the first domestic concrete counterweight steel pipe production line was built in Tanggu in 2002, which has provided thousands of kilometers of pipeline products for many offshore oil fields. It is reported that the use of this kind of steel pipe can reduce the cost of 500,000 to 1 million yuan per kilometer of submarine pipelines, greatly reducing the development cost of offshore oil fields, and enabling a number of marginal oil fields to be developed economically and effectively.Tips:  is formed by rolling strip and welding the seam, with tighter dimensional tolerances and less weight. The weld seam is heat treated after welding that no untempered martensite remains, and the weld flash can be removed from both inner and outer surfaces.   Seamless is our most popular product under this specification and A53 pipe is commonly dual certified to A106 B Seamless pipe.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/business/application-of-steel-pipe-in-ocean-engineering-and-shipbuilding-industry.html"},

It is very important to have a good security guard house design available at the property that is equipped with all the latest features.", "word-count": 797, "body": "Schools and colleges are where our children spend most of their time. So as parents and caregivers, we all want to ensure that kids are learning and growing in a safe environment. If you are in charge of a school or college, it is very important that you are ensuring secure premises for the students, as this can add a lot value to your institution.You have likely seen creative security guard house designs that enhance the appearance of the property. The fact is, these security guard houses are not just for decorative reasons; they can help in a lot more ways. Having a modern and efficient security guard house design assures the comfort of the safety team as well as keeping everyone up-to-date on all safety issues on campus.Patrol on CampusWhen you have a team of highly trained professionals working as security guards at an educational institute, you know that they are regularly patrolling the grounds to ensure safety for everyone. This team works together to see that no miscreants enter the property, and nothing unsafe is happening on campus while also assuring that your students are feeling secure just attending school. Additionally, these security guards can also supervise students’ activities with regular patrolling. Apart from this, the entry and exit points of the school or college are secure 24/7.It is very important that you have more than one security professional, so that at least one person takes care of the entry points of the school while the other one is patrolling in and around the school campus. You can have a team of security professionals who remain alert to any potential threats. Here are some more roles that a security team can perform at the educational institutions.Guard and Protect StudentsAs you are reading about the importance of having security guards at schools and colleges, the prime concern that must be in your mind is how the security guards can best protect students. They are always alert to the activities taking place in and around the campus. These professionals are skilled in operating CCTV cameras, so they keep a close eye on the happenings with the monitors. This way, they can reach the location in case they note even an indication of anything suspicious. So, if there is a fight between students at the fifth floor, the security team would come to know immediately and can reach the location on time to resolve the issue.Respond to Emergency SituationsUnlike the common belief, security guards are not the professionals who are responsible for dealing with criminals who may try to enter the premise, but these professionals are well equipped with the skills to handle emergency situations like flood, fire, attack, etc. They know how to vacate the school at the correct point in time, without causing chaos and panic among the students. In addition, they can make call to the local police authority to get immediate help as they alone may not be able to handle the situation. The security guard house design itself should be prepared in a way that it can help the team deal with the situation as effectively as possible. The guardhouse could be set up with closed circuit TV monitors, phone, and other things that the team may need to communicate and operate promptly and efficiently.Students or Staff EscortsThis would be in case the school is located in a place that is not safe for small kids. For example, if the school is positioned at a main road and small kids may find it difficult to cross it, these professionals can help them walk to their car, bus stop, or home after school hours. This will serve as additional layer of safety for the students and parents can remain stress-free about the safety of their loved ones.First Aid ResponseNo matter how hard you try, unfortunate situations like accidents or fights are likely to take place at a school or college campus. This is the reason that security authorities suggest having medical support available for the safety of students. When you have a team of security guards, you can rest assured as they are equipped with first aid treatment that can help save lives during the emergency situations. So when you hire a school private security guard, you know that you can get first aid help from the experts whenever required.Final wordsWhether big or small, the  is important to house guards who are necessary for school security. Properly trained guards can and will watch out for the safety, security and first aid needs of students of all ages.

{"heading": "Manufacturing Process of Seamless Steel Pipe (Hot rolled and Cold rolled)", "author": "Marine Lee", "description": "Generally, the production process of seamless steel pipes includes two types: hot rolling and cold drawing.", "word-count": 719, "body": "Generally, the production process of seamless steel pipes includes two types: hot rolling and cold drawing.1. Hot-rolled  are divided into general steel pipes, low and medium pressure boiler steel pipes, high pressure boiler steel pipes, alloy steel pipes, stainless steel pipes, petroleum cracking pipes, geological steel pipes and other steel pipes. Hot-rolled steel pipes are delivered in hot-rolled state or heat-treated state.The production process of hot-rolled seamless steel pipe: tube blank → heating → piercing → three-roll cross rolling, continuous rolling → pipe stripping → sizing → cooling → straightening → hydraulic test → marking → storage.The raw material for rolling seamless pipes is round pipe blanks. The round pipe blanks are cut by a cutting machine into a billet with a length of about 1 meter and sent to the furnace for heating via a conveyor belt. The tube blank is fed into the furnace and heated to approximately 1200 degrees Celsius. The heating tube billet fuel is hydrogen or acetylene. The temperature control in the furnace is a key issue. After the tube is out of the furnace, it must be pierced by a piercing machine.Generally, the more common piercing machine is a tapered roller piercing steel pipe piercing machine. This piercing machine has high production efficiency, good product quality, large perforation diameter expansion, and can penetrate a variety of steel types. After piercing, the tube blank is cross-rolled by three rolls and continuously rolled. After squeezing, take off the tube for sizing. The sizing machine uses a tapered drill bit to rotate at a high speed into the steel blank to punch holes to form a steel pipe (the inner diameter of the steel pipe is determined by the outer diameter of the sizing machine drill bit). After the steel pipe is sized, it enters the cooling tower and is cooled by spraying water. After the steel pipe is cooled, it will be straightened. After the steel pipe is straightened, it is sent by the conveyor belt to the metal flaw detector for internal flaw detection. If there are cracks or bubbles inside the steel pipe, it will be detected. After the quality inspection, the steel pipes must pass strict manual selection. After the quality inspection of the steel pipe, paint the serial number, specification, production batch number, etc. with paint. It is hoisted into the warehouse by a crane.2. Cold rolled seamless steel pipes are divided into general steel pipes, low and medium pressure boiler steel pipes, high pressure boiler steel pipes, alloy steel pipes, stainless steel pipes, petroleum cracking pipes, and other steel pipes, as well as carbon thin-walled steel pipes, alloy thin-walled steel pipes, and stainless steel pipes. Rusty thin-walled steel pipe, special-shaped steel pipe. Cold rolled and delivered in heat-treated condition.The production process of cold rolled seamless steel pipe: tube blank → heating → perforation → heading → annealing → pickling → oiling → multi-pass cold drawing → blank tube → heat treatment → straightening → hydraulic test → marking → storage.The rolling method of cold drawn seamless steel pipe is more complicated than that of hot rolling, and the first three steps of their production process are basically the same. The difference starts from the fourth step. After the round tube blank is emptied, it needs to be headed and annealed. After annealing, use a special acid liquid for pickling. After pickling, apply oil. Then it is followed by multiple cold drawing. After heat treatment, it is straightened. After the steel pipe is straightened, it is sent by the conveyor belt to the metal flaw detector for internal flaw detection. If there are cracks in the steel pipe, the problem of bubbles and the like will also be picked out.From the outside, the length of cold drawn seamless pipe is generally shorter than that of hot rolled seamless pipe. In terms of wall thickness, cold-rolled seamless pipes are more uniform than hot-rolled seamless pipes, hot-rolled pipes have lower accuracy and rough surface, while cold-rolled pipes have higher precision, better surface roughness and higher prices.Tips:ASTM A53 Gr.B is the grade in ERW high frequency welded pipe, divided into A and B grades.  is a typical carbon steel pipe.

Everyone knows your business will have a challenging period of growth.", "word-count": 550, "body": "Everyone knows the company has a difficult growth time. Google's most cursory search will send you content worthy pages about handling cash flow, remaining competitive, and attracting the right talent. And quite rightly so. There is major Growth Recruiting issues. We 're interested in the obstacles that you may not have foreseen coming your way, though.1. The wrong priorities At the very start of a growth period, founders are very likely to have their priorities a bit out of order. Although investment gives most companies the cash infusion required to take them to the next stage, constraints always come in. VCs are focused on the company's long-term plan but are not necessarily perfect for recruiting managers. What will they be for? Although you can consider the product creation or sales growth for your company outlined in the investment strategy, it is doubtful that it will be the hiring plan.From the point of view of a recruiter, this means that you will be dealing with a newly enthusiastic founding team or C-suite that is 100% purchased for product development or sales-driven strategy. This enthusiasm for delivering can lead to a cart before attitude towards the horse. The business of course wants to produce the product, but it needs the right people before it can do so.2. Damaging to morale and cultureLarge teams often consist of closely connected groups of people who have several tasks to perform. Such all-rounders have done plenty and taken the business to where it is today. It is, nevertheless, a time of change and growth. You'll need to start recruiting experts as a recruiter, rather than the generalists that make up the team as it stands.Once the team sees the hiring of a new form of an employee, the gap can seem pointy. Witnessing potentially even more skilled, experienced personnel joining the team will lead to awkward and eventually turnover with the original workers. It would also leave you with still more employees to recruit, detrimental to morale and community.A common reaction to this is to promote tenured staff, giving people from the start promotions or management positions to those who have been with the company. It can work and is often acceptable, but it is also an example of having emotions influence professional decision making.3.  Job security and career progressionIt is about getting stretched and irrevocably changed. When teams expand, the core team dynamics will be forced to change. And this is really the keyword they are being pushed to alter here. Throw in the nervousness about job security and career progression and you can find yourself dealing with an extremely damaged corporate culture very quickly. Unfortunately, turnover also goes hand-in-hand with bad business culture. It is a dangerous cycle you need to avoid before it begins.It's necessary to communicate the company's cultural values to combat this. This will in some cases involve sitting down and describing them actually. Yet it's a good exercise showing people how they fit in the business and offering a structure for the new hires.ConclusionLikewise, the communication of these values has to come from above. People need to know this change is coming and why it is going to happen. Wise founders should realize that change is huge and scary, but should also express the principles and encourage the whole organization.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/careers/3-unexpected-challenges-of-growth-hiring.html"},

And quality can only be guaranteed by using proper packaging that can preserve and protect cosmetics. These boxes play a very effective role in making sure that the products are not damaged. This makes them more presentable to the customers. And it also helps the brand to prevent any sort of losses. The packaging remains effective all through warehousing, shipping, transit, and retailing. All of these stages are vital, and if the business needs to succeed, the packaging will have to be effective here.2.    Attracting Sales is Easy:The whole idea of customizing the packaging is to make it look attractive and unique. Any brand that can make their items stand out on the shelf can easily make sales. Blank cosmetic boxes will fail to make the sale. But if the brands use techniques like die-cutting and flexographic printing to make attractive and aesthetic designs on the packaging, it will be more effective in catching the interest of people. The customization will help your white cosmetic boxes look more compelling. And that makes sales.3.    Setting the Image:The brand image is an effective way to gain the trust of the customers. This is why brands like Maybelline and L’Oréal spend so much on their brand image. The packaging that these brands use has their name and their brand logo printed clearly on them. This logo is the image of the brand. The more it is recognized, the greater will be the reach of the product.4.    Savings and Investments:One of the most basic ways in which any business can grow is by saving money. Saving is important; we all know that. So how do these boxes help us to do that? Well, for starters, they are made in a very simple and cost-effective way. They do not require complex machinery or expensive raw materials. They can be made easily by any brand. If they cannot, then they can simply contact one of the many suppliers offering these boxes at wholesale rates. Getting cosmetic boxes wholesale is one of the best ways to get a packaging that is cheap and convenient.5.    Green is Great:Another way in which this packaging can help you to grow your brand is by helping it set a good image in the market. These boxes are fully biodegradable. They can be completely broken down in about 3 months. This way, they are very suitable and useful for helping to save the planet. But more than that, they can also be used to make sure that the brand is well perceived in the market. People are very concerned about their carbon footprint in the present days. And they love a brand that also shares their concerns.6.    Shipping is Saving:We are all aware of the rise of online shopping, right? But this shipping needs one thing. It needs a proper form of packaging. The packaging that is used is well suited to the whole shipping process. We have seen that it is tough and durable. But more than that, it is very lightweight, and this helps the brand to save money. Lots of it. And all of this will help them to grow and be successful. Not only can they effectively offer their services online, but they can also make them more cost-effective.Final Words:These are the factors that have helped to make these  useful in helping manufacturers to boost their business. They have all of these advantages. And for starting a business as well, you will need the best packaging. And for that, you will need to get in touch with the best cosmetic box suppliers. They will give you the best packaging for your needs. And this is how you will also be able to make a profit and get success in your business.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/business/custom-printed-cosmetic-boxes-are-bound-to-make-an-impact-in-your-business.html"},

{"heading": "Rules on Backing Up Your PC", "author": "Jake Bollingston", "description": "Rules on Backing up Your PC", "word-count": 749, "body": "Rules on Backing up Your PCFor most companies, it is part of their protocol to back up important business documents. What is the sense of keeping two or more copies of the same file when it only adds to your costs?Most computer experts would argue that a back up is done not only because its part of the standard procedure, but because it ensures the safety and integrity of your files. What if someone hacked your computer and modified its contents? How can you retrieve your original data without a backupa? Also, there is a possibility of your computer being infected with a virus. Without a back up, you might not be able to continue your work, or worse, you’ll start again from scratch.What to Back UpIt goes without saying that you should back up all the important files in the computer. Here are some examples.* Documents, music, pictures and videos. Your documents in school or work, your favorite mp3s, your childhood memories stored in pictures, or your latest downloaded series: whatever personal file it is, keep a copy of it.* Application settings and program installers. In case of a virus or a system crash, you can easily reinstall your frequently-used programs through these files.* Bookmarks. If you have a list of websites that you visit daily, better back it up.What Not to Back Up* Not every file in your system needs to be backed up, such as the ones listed below.* Windows operating system. If your operation system gets corrupted, you can reinstall it anyway. So why bother backing them up?* System files. Likewise, you can get the system-related contents of your local drive upon reinstallation.* Program files. You can also reinstall your programs so you don’t need to duplicate its folders in another place.* Internet cache. Although these data may help you load web pages faster, you don’t need this. Your browser can just download these small files again once you access the webpage.Where to Back UpIt is a matter of preference on where you want to back up your documents. There are three different areas which you can choose as your backup locations.Local backup. This refers to another physical drive apart from your PC. Of course, the essence of backing up your files is that you will have a reserve copy of your data in case something bad happens in it. Therefore, creating a backup in the same location defeats the purpose of this process. As such, the most popular avenue for backups is through external drives or in a drive in another computer.Online backup. During the dial-up days, backing up online is considered to be time consuming and expensive. Fortunately, with the level of internet speeds today, this has become a practical option for a lot of reasons. First, your file isn’t stored in a physical hardware, which can get corrupt. Also, an online backup removes the risk of losing your data from device theft. Thus, you don’t have to worry too much on finding your stolen computer as you have a backup online.System imaging. You can also back up your system as well. This process is called system imaging. Unlike in a file backup where the backup location should be different from the actual file, in system imaging your computer creates a copy of your system in your drive. As such, you can completely restore your system in case it crashes. However, the only limitation is that you need to have a considerable amount of disk space in order to perform this process.When to Back UpYou may not know when accidents will happen so it is better if you can back up your files daily. This is pretty much easy if you are using online backup, especially if you are configured to be on auto-sync with an online database. On the other hand, if you are using a local storage such as an external drive to store data, you may have a hard time sorting all your folders for new files. To make this process easier, you can just back up only your most important files on a regular basis. All the other files get another treatment; they can be backed up every month or so, depending on their size and importance.As a saying goes, “Prevention is better than cure.” Don’t wait for your precious files to be damaged or deleted before you create a back up. And now that you’re well-equipped with the basics of backing up, you should start this process immediately.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/cgi/rules-on-backing-up-your-pc.html"},
{"heading": "What Is 3D Computer Animation?", "author": "Janet MacDonald", "description": "Computer 3D animation technology allows the average person to bring images to life and create cartoons, 3D games, product demos, graphic modes and more. Software is available at affordable prices and can be used on most computers.", "word-count": 491, "body": "Computer 3D animation involves the creation of moving pictures in a digital environment. This is the only technology that allows easy control of animations compared to physical processes such as constructing miniatures or hiring extras for shots of crowds. T o create the illusion of movement, an image is displayed on the computer screen and repeatedly replaced by a new image, or “frame”, that is similar to the previous one, but advanced slightly in time.   The viewer believes there is actual motion taking place, but this is only because consecutive images are passed through very quickly.The use of the computer to produce moving images was preceded by the stop motion animation of 3D models and frame-by-frame animation of 2D illustrations. In stop motion animation an object or person was physically moved in tiny increments. Each movement was photographed and when the series of frames was played, the illusion of movement was created. This same frame by frame technique was also used for two-dimensional geometric models.In this new art form of 3D animation, software is used to create and bring to life objects and characters in digital landscapes. Computer-generated animation is three-dimensional; that is characters and objects are modeled on a plane with an X,Y,and Z axis. Highly advanced computer tools are then used to further modify and manipulate the characters.The first feature film to incorporate realistic and completely computer-generated characters into a live action movie was “Jurassic Park” in 1993. Then in 1995, Pixar produced the first full-length cartoon, “Toy Story”, which was produced entirely with computer-generated 3-D animation.Due to the tremendous growth in computer processing power, 3-D animation has become increasingly sophisticated. Basic computer animation technology has much more affordable for the average person. There are numerous animation packages available but some brands like Maya remain immortal because of its high-end 3D computer graphics as well as its highly powerful 3D modeling software package. Because this is very popular with the film as well as the entertainment industry it's a good choice. Take note that Maya has two versions, namely Maya Complete as well as Maya Unlimited. The former is less powerful and the latter is considered highly powerful and expensive. So it would be best to choose only according to your requirements as an animator. Included in these software programs are basic 3-D shapes, which are the building blocks for modeling complex objects such as a car. Simply connect the different sizes and shapes of cubes, pyramids, spheres, cylinders to construct your object. They can then be rotated and viewed from different angles.Keep in mind that a lot of these off-the-shelf computer animation packages are helpful but they differ in the levels of complexity and features that come along with them. So it would be advisable to learn about computer 3d animation as well as the basic principles of 2D before you actually go out and get yourself any package. For more information on 3D animation software, go to", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/cgi/what-is-3d-computer-animation.html"},

Furthermore, the magnetic hard drives still deliver the lowest cost per gigabyte ratio when it comes to storage.Though it may never match the performance of the more advanced 'SSD', there are a lot of simple ways to speed up your magnetic hard drive and improve its performance.Partition your hard driveIt's perhaps one of the most useful tweaks you can to a hard drive but still most people are not doing it. Perhaps they just want the maintenance simplicity of having a single volume when they open the Windows Explorer.Dividing the hard drive into multiple partitions has quite a few benefits and one of the obvious is keeping the OS and application files separate from other data. This makes installs and uninstalls a lot safer and cleaner because it poses less risk to the stored data files. Partitioning also keeps your page file (also called a swap file) separate from the other files, increases the reliability by reducing the chance of file system corruption affecting other partitions, and allowing you to boot from multiple operating systems and versions.There are quite a few free and paid partitioning applications out there. Windows has its own built-in tools too.Regularly defragmentA single file can have pieces of it scattered all over a hard drive's physical surface. And when a lot of files are stored this way, excessive fragmentation can occur. This slows down access to the fragmented files as the hard disk head had to move to across different locations to access each of the file's fragments.You can easily prevent file fragmentation by using a defragmenter tool. The purpose of the application is to put the pieces of the fragmented files by copying each part and moving them to a solid or contiguous block on the surface of the hard drive. This makes accessing the files faster and also more efficient.Windows has a default defragmenting tool that can be accessed by right clicking on the drive in Explorer, clicking the Properties, selecting the Tools tab, and clicking on the Defragment button. You can then choose a drive to analyze and defragment. You can also opt to have your hard drive defragment automatically on a preset time.Regularly empty the browser cache and Recycle BinDeleted files are stored in the Recycle Bin, allowing Windows to recover accidentally deleted files. But it can get big after a while so it's a good practice to regularly check and empty this folder in case you don't really need the files anymore. This frees up disk space that you can use for other storage purposes. You can also press and hold the Shift key and press the Delete button to permanently delete files instead of storing them on the Recycle Bin.To free up even more disk space, you can also regularly empty the Temporary Internet Files and also other cache-type folders that applications (like browsers) use to store temporary browsing history and information. These cache files may speed up browsing but it can also fill up the hard drive if not emptied regularly. This can be done automatically through the browser settings.Leave some space for your PagefileIn Windows, the Pagefile or the swap file is a type of a virtual memory used to store data from an idle application so that more physical memory or RAM can be freed up for other important purposes. Although the size can be set manually, it is advised that this be left for the OS to decide. Putting the Pagefile in a different partition ensures that data and applications won't have to compete for the space that the Pagefile needs to use.Move the Pagefile for better performanceFor even better performance, put the Pagefile on a partition on a separate physical drive than the boot drive. This makes access to the Pagefile.sys much faster. Doing this will require a little bit more work but the improved performance can be worth the effort. This procedure also requires administrator privileges on the computer.Launch the Control Panel, click System, click Advanced System Settings, click Advanced Performance, click Settings, click Advanced, click Virtual Memory, and click Change. From here, you can set the Pagefile to a different partition or drive. To complete the process, the computer needs to be restarted.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/cgi/tips-for-an-optimized-hard-drive.html"},

With them, we are all able to perform tasks that were either never before possible, or have been delegated to people or businesses with specialized skills.

With them, we are all able to perform tasks that were either never before possible, or have been delegated to people or businesses with specialized skills. Now, the computer has turned into a very basic tool that is available for almost everyone.Over the recent years, the personal computer has evolved greatly in two main aspects: speed and storage capacity. However, it is not uncommon for the regular computer to suffer moments of sluggishness every now and then. The good news is that in most instances, these issues can be fixed.The following are some basic tips that can guarantee a faster and smoother computing experience:Minimize junk. When man landed on the moon, the scientists at NASA did it with slide rules and a rudimentary (at least in modern standards) computer with a measly 64 kilobytes of memory. Compare that to the terabytes of information that we can now store. Perhaps because of the aforementioned exponential increase in the modern PC's storage capacities, many owners believe that their machines can handle literally anything stored on their hard drives.Though this seems to be the case in most instances, even the best personal computers can choke if overloaded with junk files. One of the most common issues that plague large hard drives is the issue of fragmentation, which is also most commonly ignored. This happens when too many files are scattered in several places across the hard disk, giving the system a hard time when trying to recall the needed data.In this regard, it would be helpful to check whether your computer harbors multiple instances of the same file. Some media files, especially pictures and songs may have multiple copies inside your drive. Certain software are available that can help scan for duplicates.It is also worthwhile to clear unwanted files that may be hogging space in your computer's temporary memory. Browser cache, the Recycle Bin, Temporary Files and a lot more may need to be cleared up, freeing possibly a couple of gigabytes of memory.Keep your PC secure. While computer security evolves, viruses evolve too. And sometimes, they evolve even faster. Sometimes, a computer may suddenly be slowed down by a virus that is attacking your system.Always make sure to run good security software on your system. Most of the time, it is also advisable to run two different instances of security programs -- one anti-virus and one anti-malware program. This would help you detect security infractions more effectively.Also, many users rely too much on the real-time protection that anti-virus programs provide. A regular scan would still be in order, however, to detect any harmful software that may already have taken root.And of course, the firewall should never be disregarded. Many avid Internet users keep their firewalls turned off to speed up their connection, but this makes them bait for unwanted infiltration. Remember that aside from merely slowing your computer down, viruses can also destroy your entire system, and can even steal vital information about you! If you believe that a virus may be on to something, disconnect from the Internet immediately and run a thorough virus scan on your machine.Periodically upgrade. Upgrades for almost all types of software are released periodically in order to ensure the optimum performance of both the programs and your system. This applies not only to the applications that we use daily, but also to those that run in the background, especially the drivers.Upgrades and periodic maintenance can also help improve system performance greatly by eliminating existing and potential issues, especially the infamous DLL, SYS and EXE errors. Upon onset, these issues can wreak as much havoc as a viral infection, so it is best to prevent them from happening in the first place.Sometimes, upgrading to more recent software versions can offer increased compatibility with your system, allowing the program to fully and effectively utilize all necessary system resources. This makes for both a faster and smoother experience. Even the entire operating system needs a regular upgrade. This helps not only to optimize processes but also to close out any security holes or possible malfunctions that have been detected in previous software releases.It is true that computers are complex equipment, but we wouldn't have to delve into the more technical steps of repairing issues if they are regularly taken care of. Following these simple steps would be the perfect start.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/cgi/keeping-your-computer-fast.html"},

So I can only conclude that its lack of popularity is due to the lack of documentation online about the subject. I would like to put forward to you that when you look towards performing your next web scraping task that you should consider using c# or vb.

With new technologies and modes of operations making their way in, an animator simply cannot forego the very basics that lay the foundation of this multi-billion dollar industry. This article here elaborates the key differences between the two founding stones of animation – 2D animation and 3D animation", "word-count": 593, "body": "We all grew up watching cartoons like Looney tunes, Tom and Jerry, and plenty of Disney classics like Bambi, Mulan, and many others. These popular cartoons and movies are all shining trophies of the animation industry.While our stomach brimmed with laughter and joy by watching these cartoons and movies, a multi-billion dollar industry was embarking its journey to push itself to new inconceivable heights.The animation industry has genuinely traveled a long way through time, bearing hardships and troubles while also enjoying several perks and rewards. One can notice a very vivid and visible difference in animation from when it started to how it is today.Several advancements and technological evolution are due for credit here. It all began with simple 2D animation, and over time, has transformed and developed into the 3D animation we see today.2D and 3D animation share a number of differences that explain why such a major distinction lies in the outcome of both these animations. 2D animation, also known as traditional animation, refers to the process of creating motion in a two-dimensional space. Mainstream 2D animation, however, is nothing like the conventional animation it used to be. It has evolved from hand-drawn methods to implementing the same techniques to computer software.3D animation refers to animating characters in a three-dimensional space. Objects and characters have volume, depth, and can be rotated and moved as desired.3D animation is also referred to as CGI animation. Unlike 2D animation, 3D animation allows animating lights and cameras as well. This form of animation makes use of frames and uses motion to bring characters into life.The appearance of 2D animation is flat, as it only consists of X and Y axes. The X-axis is the horizontal dimension, while Y-axis is the vertical dimension. 2D animation is widely used in videos, promotional ads, animated films, engineering demonstrations, and mobile video games.On the other hand, the appearance of 3D animation is more realistic and life-like. It comprises X, Y, and Z axes, where X refers to height, Y refers to the width, and Z refers to depth.3D animation is generally used in architecture and medical industry, animated movies and cartoons, and high-end video games as well.2D animation is very reasonable and cost-effective as compared to 3D animation.The benefits of 2D animation, besides being cost-effective, include low lead time, easy to produce, artistic liberty, and efficiency. Whereas, the benefits of 3D animation overweigh its cost.3D animation portrays movement realistically, creates visually appealing and life-like animations, and produces high-quality results that are in demand these days.The animation process of 2D animation requires a lot of hard work, effort, and time. To animate in 2D, drawing is mandatory. Everything you see in traditional 2D animation had to be drawn frame by frame. However, with the advancement in technology, the modern 2D animation process makes use of software in developing action sequences.On the other hand, a 3D animator is not necessarily required to possess drawing skills. Every production-step is done using different software. In 3D animation, characters are an animator’s puppet that goes through several phases such as modeling, texturing, lighting, rigging, rendering, etc.The most commonly used software in 2D animation includes After Effects, Photoshop, and Adobe Animate. Since 3D animation is more frequented by animators, the industry has , some of which are free of cost!The animation industry is on the rise, and there’s nowhere to go but up.

And if you don’t have your own vehicle then you will either have to walk or choose the bus.  But if you do have your own car then you will have more choices at your disposal.  So be sure and test out how long it takes you to get to campus before you sign the lease.If your employed then you will want to factor in how far you will have to go to your place of business too. You will probably want something close to shopping and entertainment too.<b>Whats Your Budget</b>You probably won’t have access to an unlimited amount of funds.  So don’t rent more of an apartment than you can afford.  The more amenities you want and the newer the apartment community, the more expensive it will be.  So you may not be able to get the granite counters and high ceilings that you have so desired.You might want to consider renting an older apartment without a fitness center and pool.

Well, it appears that there is a device that will snap us out of our funk and that is the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2. But since this is the most decent foldable device that we have seen recently, expect that you will pay a handsome fee for it. Enter refurbished Samsung phones UK which are more affordable compared to their brand new counterparts. What then will the future hold for this second iteration of foldable device? A Quick Guide to the Foldable Galaxy The Galaxy Z Fold version 2 has been well received as it has finally addressed the flaws that were seen in the previous iteration. This is indeed a call for celebration as it brought us one step closer to having two devices in just one body. Care to take a quick tour of the Galaxy Z Fold 2? Let’s get started with the basics first: Unique Design Foldable mobile devices are not really new. Before, mobile phone companies were able to produce flip phones where the screen is connected to the body with a hinge. Today, the same idea is being applied to smartphones but it is not a mean feat until Samsung has released the Galaxy Z Fold. The concept was sound but the execution wasn’t well received as there were way too many flaws. And after several months, the Z Fold 2 came into being. This new iteration transforms itself into a huge tablet with a screen size of 7.6 inches which is quite big although it is a bit smaller than the iPad mini. But being able to squeeze this massive screen into a foldable device makes it more portable. No need to bring your tablet or even your laptop with you since the  can become a tablet easily. How it was built was definitely an improvement which is one of the reasons why it was priced so high. Although it will feel a bit bulky when the device is folded, it has the right amount of thickness that will still enable you to pocket it provided that your pants pockets are loose. This will take some getting used to especially when we are all used to being able to hold our smartphones with just one hand.Large DisplayCompared to its previous iteration, the size of the screen on the Z Fold 2 is large enough to use even when it is in its folded state. However, you are better off with refurbished Samsung phones UK if you won’t be utilizing its unfolded state often. On a good note, Samsung has made their latest foldable phone more intriguing and exciting to use both in compact mode and unfolded. This is due to the fact that Samsung has finally corrected the hinge design thus making it stronger and durable plus it enables the screen to be fully stretched out without breaking it. The display will look a bit more fragile compared to regular screens, but it can handle your every day usage. As a matter of fact, it can also dish out up to 120Hz of refresh rate just like the more compact smartphones out there. Like it was mentioned before, Samsung made some tweaks to the hinge of their Z Fold since now it can be easily propped open in any position that you like. The Flex Mode helps clean up the screen which is another advantage to this design. User’s Interface One of the best features of  Galaxy Z Fold 2 is its interface as it has finally managed to put using multiple apps simultaneously in just one device. This is where Flex Mode comes in as it is the program that lets you do a split-screen on this folding smartphone. Basically, you can run multiple apps at the same time on your screen without feeling too cluttered or disorganized. The good news is that the split screen software is compatible with several applications which is definitely useful for work or when ensuring that your business is running smoothly with just a single device. The downside here is that you will always be redirected to Samsung’s browser no matter how hard you want to try Google Chrome and others. Top Performance SpecsIf you are looking for the fastest handheld device to use this year, you will find that this foldable smartphone fits the bill. As a matter of fact, it has the same specs as that of the Note 20 Ultra wherein the Snapdragon 865 Plus powers it. The RAM is at 12GB which is already laptop quality which makes it capable of running multiple applications without any lags. Although Apple’s latest iPhone will still outmatch this unit, the resulting performance of this folding smartphone is already impressive.However, it is a bit disappointing that the internal storage is limited to just 256GB and worse, there is now way for you to expand it since the microSD slot is missing. It would have been nice if this unit could have up to 512GB of storage especially with its price.Get Spoiled with the Penta-Camera SetupThe penta-camera setup in the Z Fold 2 guarantees great photos, sure, but they still cannot beat the quality of the cameras from Note 20 Ultra. Yes, it does have three cameras with 12MP (regular, telephoto, and ultra-wide) plus 2 cameras at 10MP and they do yield some great shots, but the Note 20 Ultra has given us a taste of how superior its zooming capabilities are. Even the regular S20 and its bigger sibling have better camera quality and they are considerably cheaper too. You may even find better camera quality if you look for refurbished Samsung phones UK and at cheaper prices too. The Fate of the Galaxy Z Fold 2The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 is definitely a novel smartphone with its unique design and multitasking capabilities. However, it is also an expensive smartphone and tablet available in the market at its current retail price is a whopping £1,799. There are no other versions of this such one with a bigger storage which is a bummer given that at its price, there should have been an option to expand the storage. Not only that, but you will also be missing out on the Galaxy buds! However, there are some upsides to this device and that is it is cheaper than the Thom Browne Edition and it is 5G ready too. Are those good reasons to get this model? Weighing its pros and cons may help.Pros: Cons: Although the Galaxy Z Fold 2 has fixed most of the issues in the previous model, there are still flaws in it that will most certainly be addressed in the next iteration which will happen for sure. If you are in the market for a novel smartphone, and have the budget to purchase one, this is a great investment.On the other hand, if you are on a budget or want a device that is more compact and simpler to use, refurbished Samsung phones UK should be a good place to find those budget-friendly smartphones that you have been looking for. You can approach the manufacturers directly or, you can look for third-party retailers to see what your options are.Where to Buy Refurbished Samsung Phones UK? If you are not willing to part with your hard-earned money to an overpriced foldable phone, then why not consider  instead? There are plenty of online sites that offer refurbs at discounted rates such as in QwikFone which means that you will not run out of options. Also, you will find that they come in different conditions meaning that there is a good chance that you will come across a pristine condition Samsung device that is unlocked at a price that is well within your budget.At QwikFone, you will find this and more because you are guaranteed to get good value for your money. Not only are their refurbished Samsung smartphones relatively cheap, they are in pristine and unlocked condition too. You will get free accessories, 12-months warranty, plus the option to pay for one in installment.Between the pricey Galaxy Z Fold 2 and refurbished Samsung phones UK, there is a huge chance that many will forgo grabbing the foldable device because of budget issues. Still, it is not a bad choice for those who want a smartphone and a tablet at the same time.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/communication/what-is-the-future-of-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2.html"},
{"heading": "Break Through the Noise with Your Communication", "author": "Christian D. Malesic", "description": "Communication is not just about providing a message; it is about having the message heard. To be ‘successful’ communication, we need the receiver to interact and take action. Thus, anything short of interaction is a fail. But, how do we break through?", "word-count": 805, "body": "Communication is not just about providing a message; it is about having the message heard and understood. Ideally, communication goes a step beyond. For our message to really make a difference, to be ‘successful’ communication, we need the receiver to interact and take action. Sometimes our communications are purely informational, but that is rare indeed; usually we are attempting to invoke an active response: renew your membership, sign up for our newsletter, buy this widget, register for our conference, or call your legislator. Thus, anything short of interaction is a fail. But, how do we break through?People are PeopleYour receivers are your clients, members, or perspective customers. They are not dollar signs, numbers, bots, or head counts. So, first and foremost, remember that you are dealing with people. Each human being is different, with different sensibilities, likes, dislikes, and thoughts about you and your message. Long gone are the Henry Ford days when he arrogantly proclaimed you can have his Model T in any color you want, as long as it is black. Today, we want to be treated as the unique souls that we are. Luckily, tech can help with that. Build your mass message as if you were sending it only to one of your favorites, then use tech to mass customize the message by replacing words, phrases, names, and titles to adapted it to each specific receiver.Roar Like a GuerrillaTry guerrilla tactics. Guerrilla tactics are the art of surprise and catching the receiver off-guard, in this case, of course, in a good way. Your message can really breakthrough to the executive if you can reach them while they are relaxing with their Saturday morning coffee rather than at the bustling office. Or, if you can catch their eye right after a game of golf or racquetball. Or, while they are at a conference or on vacation. Meaning, be there in the unsuspected place in an unusual manner.Define guerrilla differently. Think of a guerrilla approach as something your organization hasn’t done before or in a long while; not necessarily as something new to the world that has never been tried before. Set a percentage of your communications aside for the guerrilla in you. Perhaps 10-15% of your communications plan and budget. Then, as always, monitor it, test it, analyze it, and even graph it. If it is a successful tactic, next year it becomes part of the main plan with 10-15% tried on something new.What’s Old is New AgainYou can be a guerrilla by digging up old approaches and re-applying them as a piece of your current plan. A great example of what’s-old-is-new-again is direct mail. Once the mainstay of marketers and communicators everywhere, direct mail has been nearly abandoned in the last two decades in favor of the inexpensive mass electronic mediums. This makes direct mail prime for reaching your receiver. Except during election season, receivers simply do not get that much direct mail; thus, the scourge of the piles of paper junk mail has become a thing of past generations. Direct mail maybe be ripe to be used in your communications plan once again.Other breakthrough tactics include sending holiday cards on non-traditional holidays when yours may be the only one the receiver receives, or sending chocolates with your logo emblazoned, or painting your vehicle with your company colors in a wild, flamboyant fashion. Consider, renting out a movie theater and inviting them to the premier of a new anticipated blockbuster on the Thursday before the official release, complete with popcorn and soda. Maybe try hiring actors to dress like superheroes for selfie photos in front of your step-and-repeat at the town fair or before the big game. The point is: observe others, get ideas from TV and movies, be different, try new things. Breaking through can be about… well… being different, being unpredictable, being creative.Breaking through doesn’t meaning breaking the fundamental rules of communication and marketing. It doesn’t mean to send fewer communications or too many. It doesn’t mean rewriting the book or forgetting the proven science of the past. No, instead, breaking through means really remembering. Remember the golden rule, that you should treat people the way you want to be treated. You want to feel special. Make them feel that way. Remember to always use strong writing skills with proper grammar and punctuations, while being as uniquely you as you can be. And, remember to stay within the guidelines of your organization’s philosophy, style, and image. After that, breaking though is about having fun with it, capturing their attention, then telling them something worth hearing, seeing, or reading.If you found this article insightful and useful, you may similarly appreciate the other three articles from this four-part series on communications: The Goldilocks Zone of Communication, Anatomy of a Communication Message, and Do It Their Way: Connecting with Clients &amp; Members.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/communication/break-through-the-noise-with-your-communication.html"},

For the purposes of this list, this will be the definition we’ll stick with. derived much of their appeal from their resemblance to their tabletop forebears, and the recent surge in the popularity of tabletop gaming has inspired plenty of developers to try to recapture the elements that make these games special.The defining features of these games are some combination of deep characters, rich, meticulous narratives, and an emphasis on detailed battle-planning. The  want you to care about every decision, because you never know which ones will make the difference between life and death.Baldur's Gate II Vampire Bodhi CRPGImage: Baldur’s Gate II: Shadows of Amn / BioWareBaldur’s Gate II: Shadows of AmnA true classic in the CRPG genre, Baldur’s Gate II adapted to the world and ruleset used in Dungeons &amp; Dragons to tell its epic, sprawling story.As a child of Bhaal, the God of Murder, you must select your team to pursue and defeat the prodigiously powerful wizard Jon Irenicus, literally to hell and back. Characters are fantastically individualised, with favourites including muscled powerhouse Minsc, and Boo, his pet miniature giant space hamster.The game is packed with imaginative quests and wonderful voice acting, making Baldurs Gate II a must-play CRPG. Disco ElysiumDisco Elysium is truly unlike any other game to come before, CRPG or otherwise. For this reason, it’s best played with as little prior knowledge as possible.On the surface, it’s a detective story. Solve a murder, prevent a war. Simple. Oh, except that your detective is an alcoholic, drug addicted mess of a human, and the very skill points you invest into him become the voices in his head. No big deal. Divinity: Original Sin IIIf you happen to be looking for a modernised version of Baldur’s Gate (or waiting patiently for the full version of Baldur’s Gate III), you could do a lot worse than the Divinity series. Including plenty of high-fantasy action with D&amp;D-inspired RPG mechanics, Divinity does a fine job of capturing everything that we love about CRPGs.Divinity: Original Sin II is generally considered to be slightly more polished than the original, but both are genre masterpieces. With up to four-player co-op, you and your buddies can band together to fend off the monstrous Voidwoken and, naturally, save the world. Dragon Age: OriginsThe first (and arguably finest) game in the Dragon Age series, Dragon Age: Origins made some excellent gameplay innovations and told a story driven by an epic fantasy plot and a cast of wonderfully individualised characters.Dragon Age: Origins was also noteworthy, particularly at the time of release, for not pandering solely to the young-straight-male demographic, and has since become a favourite for female and non-binary gamers. With a wide array of romance options and a story that truly shifts in response to your choices, Origins is a game that any player will want to keep going back to. Fallout 2The Fallout series has become monumental in its own right, and was one of the foundational franchises that came to define the CRPG genre. Fallout 2 in particular made an array of vital quality-of-life improvements over the first game that made it much easier to play, and also introduced the goofy, tongue-in cheek tone that the series became known for.In Fallout 2, the player must journey from their ailing, drought-stricken community to find a terraforming device called a Garden of Eden Creation Kit. Things go poorly, of course. Why isn’t life ever easy in a radiation-ridden nuclear apocalypse?Neverwinter NightsAnother entry from developer Bioware, Neverwinter Nights was the closest thing to a sequel for Baldur’s Gate II that was available for some time. Using the updated third-edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons ruleset and setting and a fancy new 3D engine, the main campaign tasked the player with finding and stopping a plague affecting the city of Neverwinter.While the core game was solid, Neverwinter Nights truly shone when it was in the hands of its fervent community. Content packs added new models for monsters, gear and more, and servers delivered all types of gameplay, from arena battles to hardcore permadeath role-play. Pillars of EternityMade by some of the same developers responsible for the likes of the Baldur’s Gate and Icewind Dale games, Pillars of Eternity looks more like a direct sequel to its ’90s inspirations than a game that was released in 2015.It’s text-heavy and incredibly plot driven, which is hardly a bad thing for hardcore CRPG fans. While its combat offers incredible strategic depth, the game also takes care to award XP for quest completion and exploration rather than kills, making non-violent approaches more viable and satisfying. Planescape: TormentWhile CRPGs have a tendency to adopt high fantasy settings (no doubt thanks to their tabletop counterparts), the cult-classic Planescape: Torment delivers a story and setting that are highly original and delightfully alien.Rather than an emphasis on combat, this game places its focus almost entirely on its central character’s story. As the immortal ‘Nameless One’, you must journey to different planes of existent to recover memories of your past lives, and discover the source of your immortality. TyrannyTyranny is a game about oppression. A brutal overlord seeks to expand and tighten their control, and, rather than take the role of a freedom fighter or resistance member, you play as one of their enforcers. The game uses this role as a vehicle for exploring a more insidious, realistic type of evil, rather than stereotypical villains getting around kicking puppies.Tyranny is also a game about choice, and even the most minute can have far reaching effects. To reinforce this, your characters’ abilities are unlocked according to their reputational status with various factions, leading you to compromise between power gain and story outcomes. Wasteland 2If Divinity and Pillars of Eternity are spiritual successors to Baldur’s Gate, then Wasteland 2 is a successor to the CRPG Fallout games. This is no surprise, seeing as it was developed by the same people that created Fallout 1, 2, and Fallout Tactics prior to the franchise’s acquisition by Bethesda.Gone, however, is much of the sense of humour present in Fallout. Instead, Wasteland 2 focuses on the grim reality of human life in desperate circumstances, and is full of difficult decisions that’ll leave you struggling to achieve the least-worst outcome. It’s a powerful experience that will stick with you long after you’re done playing.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/communication/start-your-crpg-addiction-with-the-10-best-crpgs-ever-made.html"},

What each of these terms mean? Do they all mean the same thing? What are the differences? Finally, how to find the best deal online on these phones?", "word-count": 1420, "body": "More and more eyes are turning to the second hand and refurbished phones market. The reasons behind this increasing interest in second hand phones varies from one person to another depending on the individual's main goal and whether they are looking to save the environment and recycle smartphones, or simply looking to save money by opting for a cheaper alternative when it's time to replace the old or broken phone of theirs.If you are one of the people who are looking into buying one of these phones but consider yourself to be relatively new to this market, this post is for you. All the information you need to know about refurbished, reconditioned, and second hand phones, the differences between them and where to buy them in the UK as well as how to choose the best deal for your needs.While many people use these 3 terms interchangeably, each of these types has a separate meaning. Since customers should be aware of what each of these types entails in order to be prepared and know what to expect and what not to accept, we're going to start with the meaning of refurbished, reconditioned, and second hand phones in the UK.Refurbished vs. Reconditioned Starting with the two most confusing concepts. Refurbished phones and reconditioned phones are usually mistaken for each other. However, there can be a big difference between the two.While a refurbished phone is usually used to refer to smartphones that were returned by their former owners and then the seller tested, cleaned, and re-packaged the device as is in order to be re-sold, reconditioned devices usually go through some sort of repair or have a certain part replaced.So, in essence, a refurbished phone is usually kept in its original new or like-new state by the former users themselves and needs nothing more than a quick test and some cleaning of the phone's outer body if needed.With reconditioned phones, on the other hand, the device requires the interference of the seller/refurbisher to return the phone to its pristine state by repairing one or more aspects in the phone.Also, reconditioned phones can have certain alternations performed on them according to the previous user's request such as having the phone's SIM software unlocked for example. When do refurbished phones are the same as reconditioned phones?Well, this mainly depends on the source of the refurbished phone. If the seller of a refurbished phone is the manufacturing brand such as Apple or Samsung, or the seller is the network that is offering the phone's deal such as AT&amp;T or Verizon, then the previously mentioned difference between refurbished and reconditioned phones would apply.With third party refurbished phones such as specialized refurbishment centers such as QwikFone, for example, refurbished phones are usually pre-owned or used phones that were renewed by the refurbishing brand which means that the refurbished phone is, essentially, reconditioned.Refurbished vs. Second hand  Another two terms that can be confused for each other where there is actually a room for a huge difference between the two is refurbished phones and second hand phones.Just like with refurbished and reconditioned, the refurbished and second hand concepts can mean the same thing when talking about .There are two ways to get refurbished phones:While both of these cases talk about refurbished phones as almost new and as used or second hand. There is the obvious case of second hand phones being sold in their second hand state without any repairs or renewal by the seller.This type of second hand phones that are being sold in an as is condition can be found through professional sellers as well as through their previous owners directly. While these second hand phones are most likely to come at the lowest price points compared to refurbished and reconditioned phones. However, second hand phones have a massive potential pitfall that lies in the condition of the device. While broken and defective second hand phones for sale can be useful for mobile repair professionals who would benefit from repurposing the working parts of these phones, as a regular mobile phone user, it would be much better to find a refurbished phone for sale so that you're able to guarantee the pristine quality and avoid any potential future repair expenses.For customers who want to save the money by paying the second hand price and want to get a refurbished phone in a pristine condition at the same time, third-party refurbished smartphones would be the most suitable option that qualifies for all of those requirement.How to find trustworthy refurbished phones for sale? There are many factors that play important roles in every customer's decision as to where to look for and buy second hand phones in the UK. Of course, the budget is the lead factor in this issue, however, it is not the only one.Given that it is safer to stay at home as much as possible nowadays and go out only when the need calls to, ordering your refurbished second hand phone online may be the best way to go.The question now is how to choose a reliable second hand refurbished phone vendor based only on their online presence and how can you establish trust?Well, the keyword here is the experience. First, you want to avoid sellers that don't offer the refurbishment in-house because that would most likely mean that the seller does not offer repair services as a part of the device's warranty since there is no repair center available.So, once you locate your refurbishment center online that you want to buy your next smartphone from, start doing your research buy reading up on the brand's history. Points such as how long the brand has been operating in the market will be useful in determining how reliable this brand actually is. For example, a refurbished phone business that has been in the market for several years would be much better and more trustworthy that a business that is just starting.To that end, checking out the refurbished phone's seller's online reviews also carries great weight previous customers' experiences with the seller will tell you a lot about the seller's performance and can have a huge indication as to how your own experience with that seller is going to be.Choosing the perfect deal for second hand phones in the UK Some of the most important factors that must affect your decision when choosing your refurbished phone vendor is the terms that this vendor is including for the deal. For example, how long is the warranty policy? can you return the phone? What are the refunding arrangements? How is the technical support that is being offered by that vendor? and so on.Warranties &amp; assurancesWith second hand and refurbished phones, the warranty policy is one of the first things that you want to check out before placing your order with any online seller. With a phone that has already been used before, you need to make sure that it was properly refurbished and the best indicator of the refurbishing quality is the phone's own performance.So, normally, a seller that trusts the quality of their product will have no issue providing a decent warranty policy that extends over the course of several months and guarantees free repairs for the device if it turned out to have any technical issue caused by manufacturing or refurbishment processes.Some sellers such as QwikFone will even provide a replacement option to avoid any problems with the customers if the device turned out to have any issue that cannot be repaired.Of course, all the services and replacement products that are provided by the seller within the warranty policy are going to be free since this is what a warranty means in the first place.Accessories &amp; addonsAnother good second hand phone deal indicator is accessories. No customer should ever accept to use someone else's mobile phone's accessories. However, a  should include the phone's accessories in a brand-new condition to guarantee the safety of the customer as well as the customer's budget!The most essential accessories to look for with every phone are, of course, the charger, the charging cable if applicable, earphones, and a SIM ejection tool. Installments possibilityOne of the biggest concerns regarding buying a third-party refurbished smartphone is that these deals usually come with the obligation to pay the entire price of the phone upfront, whereas with carrier refurbished deals customers get to pay monthly installments.Thankfully, some refurbished phone vendors provide means for their customers to enable them to pay monthly for second hand third party refurbished phones such as PayPal credit and other financing portals.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/communication/what-are-refurbished-reconditioned-and-second-hand-phones.html"},

Another definition is 'a Qualified Lead in sales is a lead that is generated by a marketing strategy that is based on research and that meets specific criteria.' Still another definition is 'a Qualified Lead in sales is a lead that was generated by direct marketing resources that focus on qualifying prospects to obtain information about what they might be interested in.'All of these definitions are useful in their own way because each definition allows for different types of qualified leads. For example, a lead generated through direct marketing resources, such as cold calling or other out-of-home marketing efforts, is more similar to a Qualified Lead in sales than a lead generated by a website, newsletter, or other traditional sales medium.Likewise, a qualified lead in sales may be created through internet resources, such as e-mail marketing or web pages. In each case, qualified leads in sales require a significant amount of time, effort, data, and analysis to be generated before a sale can be closed.While answers to 'what is a Qualified Lead in sales?' can be difficult, it is important to remember that the definition should be flexible enough to allow for any situation.The Qualified Lead in sales definition needs to allow for the potential for a sales opportunity to occur even if the prospect did not actively request information regarding a product or service.There are many qualified prospects in every type of sales situation, and qualified leads in sales are the absolute core of any successful business. A qualified lead is the 'lead' that can sometimes make the difference between success and failure. In today's business world, all salespeople must be proactive in understanding how to convert their lead into an opportunity.If you do not understand how to convert your lead into an opportunity, you will not know the next step of your sales process. What does that mean? Well, it means you may miss a sale or two, or worse yet, get someone else to make that sale for you.Here are five Sales &amp; Marketing alignment recommendations that nail it. Best Practices #1: When the lead is converted, don't check the do not create opportunity check box.The exception to that is when converting a lead into a matching Contact and Account that already exist. When you do that, you have committed yourself to many potential sales calls that you could not close.So, while you are looking at those leads, consider removing them from your roster and focus on those that can be converted into opportunities.The second recommendation is to make sure those prospects really are ready to be converted. They need to show that they have the motivation and drive needed to make that next step.If you do not understand how the prior lead conversion metrics work, take the time to read about them and understand before you move forward with that particular prospect.Nothing impacts your bottom line more than the number of calls you can keep from occurring. So, if you want to convert those previously converted leads into opportunity win rates, you need to put in the effort to do that first.With so many  on the market today, how do you know the best way to get a qualified lead? What is the 'best' or 'proper' way to generate your leads? The best way for one person to generate their leads may not be necessarily the best for someone else.And even though every business/company may have a different way of generating qualified leads, it still comes down to several important factors: if you don't have the right information and tools, if the leads you are generating aren't high quality, etc.So, what is the best way to get a qualified lead? Honestly, I can only answer that from my experience. When I started in the direct sales industry, I really didn't know anything about generating qualified leads. I had signed up for autoresponder programs, I've purchased a few different list building programs, and I had some success with those methods.But after struggling for several months, I finally realized that the key to generating quality leads was missing something.The best way to get a qualified lead is to develop an effective relationship with your customer/client. Most businesses today don't understand this one bit.They believe that once they sign up or buy their product, they own the prospect. This is not true! You must learn to build a relationship with your client/prospect to convert them into a buyer.Once you do that, you can convert them into a qualified lead... which is the goal you are trying to accomplish.Many online business owners are often confused between a prospect and a lead. While there is a slight difference between the two, they are very much alike and serve almost the same purpose.You will find that most marketers tend to refer to prospects and leads to the same thing. This is only because all three terms mean basically the same thing. The only difference is the way each business defines the word 'prospect.'A lead is someone that you contact on your own. You do not necessarily sell to them, although you can do that with many lead generating systems.A prospect is someone you contact, and when you work with them to find out more about them. This could be someone you are working with to generate a mailing list, or perhaps you want to work with an offline client for products or services that they need.Either way, it is a lead, and sometimes you have to pay for a lead, especially if it was a lead that was worthwhile for you to contact in the first place. can be a challenging thing to do, but by following some of the tips mentioned above, your job will become easier.The leads are then more likely to be more qualified and interested in what you have to offer. When you generate quality leads through email marketing or other direct mail methods, you will notice your business sales begin to increase as you generate more business on an ongoing basis. Using these tips can help to make your job much easier.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/communication/what-is-a-qualified-lead-in-sales.html"},

{"heading": "What Should you Choose: AngularJS or ReactJS?", "author": "BiztechCS", "description": "If you’re confused about choosing AngularJS development services or ReactJS development services, read this article. It covers the strength and weakness of both the development frameworks to help you make the right decision.", "word-count": 598, "body": "When it comes to web development, we are often confused about the framework we should choose. After all, there are hundreds of them available in the market. But developers often suggest that we should choose the one that’s best suited for us. For this, we must know about the technology and its features.In this article, we will learn about the pros and cons of the two most demanding services, AngularJS development services, and .First, let’s get a brief idea about both the frameworksAngularJS is a powerful front-end JavaScript framework used to build dynamic web apps. Google launched it in 2010, and today many big companies like Nike, Apple, PayPal, and Udemy rely on it for their customer experience.ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library, used to develop user interfaces for websites and mobile apps. Launched in 2013, many big companies like Netflix, DropBox, and Khan Academy leverage it, as it has no server-side rendering.  Now, let’s compare AngularJS and ReactJS A DOM is an API that defines the logical structure of the document. It helps in understanding the flow of HTML and XML documents.AngularJS and ReactJS have different approaches for defining the logical structure. AngularJS has a real DOM, and for every change in the application, it creates a new DOM from scratch and then executes it. ReactJS, on the other hand, has an inbuilt virtual DOM that re-renders only the updated part of the application and executes only the changes instead of reloading the page.Data binding varies according to the usage of the application. If you have an entertainment app that only allows you to view the videos and content, Reacts’ one-way data binding would be profitable. However, if you have a booking or management app, you require a framework that provides two-way data binding like AngularJS.The difference is that in one-way data binding, any model changes would only affect the view. In two-way data binding, any model change would affect the view and vice versa.When it comes to AngularJS development services, it’s easier for developers to update the app to the latest version. Using a command-line interface and the ng_update component, they can instantly upgrade to the latest version.If you’re going for ReactJS development services, let me tell you, it lags in compatibility. Here, the developers need to use third party extensions for updating and modifying the app components. Also, they need to keep a regular check on the external libraries and whether they are compatible with React’s latest version.AngularJS is a framework and has a lot of features, modules, and complex components. So, the developers have to learn a lot, including TypeScript, RxJS, pipes, and dependency injection, before heading towards the actual development.ReactJS is a library, and it’s easy for developers to learn it. With a handful of JavaScript knowledge, developers can build apps in React’s ecosystem. Thus, language-wise, ReactJS wins.We know the importance of testing an app before the final launch. And how great it feels if it done via a single tool.AngularJS gives us that benefit. It makes app testing possible via a single tool like Protractor, Jasmine, and Karma. Talking about ReactJS, it’s not possible to test an app with a single tool. Being an external library, it depends on multiple tools for testing. For example, Jest for JavaScript code testing, React- unit for unit testing, etc.Final ThoughtsBoth  and ReactJS development services have their own set of advantages and disadvantages. Even developers would prefer the one based on their requirements. So, it is advisable to choose the one that best suits your business needs—for example, ReactJS for small-size apps, AngularJS for enterprise apps.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/computers/what-should-you-choose-angularjs-or-reactjs.html"},

This article speaks of Salesforce health cloud and EMR integration and all you need to know about the integrations.", "word-count": 540, "body": "So, how does Salesforce Health cloud work with EMR data? Salesforce Health cloud provides a 360-degree view of a patient’s history to the practitioners and other stakeholders in the healthcare industry.By integrating Electronic Medical Record or EMR with the Health cloud doctors or clinicians can view the entire medical history of the patient including the previous diagnosis to treatments and this information can be further shared among peers for a better assessment of a patient’s file. Health cloud makes the experience personalized at different levels for both patients and businesses. While it strengthens doctor-patient interactions, healthcare providers can build a better database of their patients. Let’s explore how Salesforce Health Cloud-EMR integration benefits patients and healthcare providers. What is Salesforce Health Cloud? It is a unified platform that caters to both patients and the health service providers. While patients have better control over their medical journeys, their providers access data with a more insightful, personalized approach. Essentially, it offers a deeper understanding of the patient to the providers with medical interactions they’ve had in the past, post-care experiences, and more. This vastly helps improve the services of care providers, businesses, to implement best practices for the optimal patient experience. Also Read: What does Health Cloud do with EMR?To break it down, Health Cloud overlaps EMR with CRM. How though? By giving access to EMR data within the CRM systems. It is this comprehensive data comprising clinical history and other records that makes the Health Cloud an absolute necessity for the healthcare industry. It gives out the true picture of a patient’s medical background to the providers so that they can diagnose well and give the best treatment possible. Here are a few things that you should know about Health Cloud integrating EMR data into CRM: -The built-in model of Health Cloud follows HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) guidelines. Health Cloud ensures that it follows FHIR protocols with each release. -The built-in services make it easy for the users and business owners to upload data into the Health Cloud. For older HL7 versions, users can seek HL7 vendor services to load data into the Health Cloud. -Users can avail Salesforce Shield to encrypt data to secure patient information in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) post the uploading of the clinical records. -The Health Cloud also gives an additional layer of security wherein you decide who sees the data with field-level security. -The Health Cloud also accommodates the notes taken by nurses which don’t usually get uploaded in the EMRs as such. Does Health Cloud diminish the role of EMR?Not at all. A Health Cloud doesn’t mean you don’t need an EMR system anymore. An EMR can be used for maintaining patient conditions, treatments, CPT codes, and billing. While a Health Cloud should be used for non-treatment tasks for a simple reason – Health Cloud is majorly used by marketing, businesses, and analysts who are not directly related to the treatment as such. Also Read: Looking to implement Salesforce Health Cloud? today for , integration or support and maintenance.

You create a landing page where people can sign up for your email list, drive some hot traffic to that page, email them regularly promoting your products, and watch the sales come in.Sounds great right? But just like everything else in this world, every good thing has its dark side.Let me explain.When you make your offer to your potential customers, they're going to be skeptical and question the heIl out of your product. In person, you can easily address whatever objections your potential customers have for your product.But when you sell on the Internet, it's harder to do so since they're not physically in front of you. That's why whenever you write your copy, you have to anticipate their objections. You have to be able to predict what they might be thinking when they listen (or in this case read) to your offer, and then address it right away in your copy.That's why when I work with clients, I always ask them a series of market research questions, and one specific question I ask is:'What are three (or more) objections that would come up when a potential customer learns about your product or service? And how would you address those objections?'That's a question you should ask yourself and talk about when you sell your own products or services to your subscribers through email. And when you do it correctly, you'll have removed almost, if not all, of their buying resistance by the time they get to the end of your copy.It'll definitely take some time and practice to get this down.

Recorded systems, on the other hand, should give vital information on the appearance and activities of any criminals, which can make a huge difference to a police investigation.Peace of mindFor anyone working in, shopping in or visiting your business premises, the knowledge that there is a working CCTV system in place brings peace of mind. Not only does it let your employees know that you are concerned for their safety, but customers and visitors recognise it as a deterrent and automatically feel safer than in a business where there are no cameras at all. Whilst not everyone likes the presence of CCTV cameras in public places, most people would say that such systems make them feel more comfortable.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/computers/3-ways-cctv-can-help-your-business.html"},

To be completely honest, I don’t remember doing such a thing at all.Anyways, once in a while I play with one of my friends who’s a huge chess nerd.I remember this one day I was playing chess with him.

You create your own.Two short sentences, but a huge lesson in them.It’s the importance of thinking and creating something yourself versus copying someone else.In certain cases, it is ok to copy someone else, as long as you eventually turn their style into your own.

Otherwise, when I’m in motion, it’s pretty easy.But now that I’m a bit taller than I was 10 years ago, I’ll probably have an easier time now.It’s also interesting that biking is one of those skills that you can never unlearn.

Unfortunately, all applicants say (or lie) they are motivated. Fortunately, pre-employment personality tests plus certain pre-hire assessment methods can help you hire employees who are productive and motivated to help you grow your business. This article reveals what to do to hire the best.", "word-count": 708, "body": "Managers need to hire motivated, productive employees. Unfortunately, all applicants say (or lie) they are motivated. Fortunately, pre-employment personality tests plus certain pre-hire assessment methods can help you hire employees who are productive and motivated to help you grow your business. 5 MAIN WORK MOTIVATIONS ON THE JOBJobs usually have five categories of work activities employees may focus on:1.  Financial Gain2.  Helping People3.  Creative Work4.  Exerting Control5. Increasing Knowledge So, what should hiring managers do to hire employees who are motivated by the right factors to become productive employees? First, use a pre-employment personality test to benchmark motivation test scores. To do this, have your best employees in each job take the pre-hire test. Since you crave to hire employees who have same qualities as your best, their scores becomes the benchmark test scores. Pre-employment test benchmarking research I do continually finds that sales reps are most highly motivated by (A) seeking Financial Gain, i.e., making sales and (B) Exerting Control, e.g., following-up with customers. So, when testing sales rep applicants, you could prefer applicants who get high test scores on those two motivations.   Another research tidbit for you: In my personality test research, I often find a company’s best customer service reps and administrative employees get high pre-hire test scores on (A) Helping People and (B) Increasing Knowledge. Tip: When you test and assess applicants for such jobs, you may prefer applicants who get high test scores on those two motivations. BEWARE: ACHIEVEMENT MOTIVATION IS WORTHLESS IN YOUR HIRING DECISIONSManagers sometimes ask me if “Achievement Motivation” is important. They wrongly think that people high in Achievement Motivation are likely to be high-achievers. Nonsense! Reason: High Achievement Motivation does not correlate with becoming a productive high-achiever at work: People only feel motivated to make achievements they personally consider important. They are not motivated to achieve things they consider unimportant. For instance, if a person who has ‘general’ high Achievement Motivation is put in sales rep job, but that person is not motivated to (A) seek Financial Gain by making sales and (B) Exert Control to follow-up with customers, then that person will fail in sales job. Interestingly, I know someone whose adult son took a personality quiz that indicated the son has a high Achievement Motivation. But, the son was going nowhere in his jobs and career. They begged me to talk with their adult son. I did. I quickly discovered he feels high Achievement Motivation to do activities he loves doing, specifically, playing video games and spending much time on social media! No wonder he is a failure in his jobs and career. Lesson: Do not confuse a job applicant’s high Achievement Motivation with achieving a lot on the job. People only want to achieve in activities they feel motivated to do. OTHER PRE-HIRE APPLICANT ASSESSMENT METHODS TO HELP YOUA personality pre-employment test may tell you if a job applicant got same motivation test scores as your company’s best, superstar employees in each job. If an applicant got the same motivation test scores, then you can use other applicant assessments, also. First, give pre-employment intelligence test. Find benchmark intelligence test scores of your superstars in each job. Then, you could prefer job applicants who get the benchmark intelligence test scores. Second, in interviews, ask applicants for results they achieved. Since many applicants lie about their results, you should ask:   “Whom can I contact to verify the results you said you achieved?” Watch the applicant’s body language to help determine if applicant was honest about results or exaggerated. Third, another applicant assessment method is realistic job observation (RJO): Have applicants who got good pre-employment personality and intelligence test scores, plus impressed you in job interviews, spend a half-day observe an employee performing the job they applied for. Then, you ask (a) if applicant still wants that job and (b) employee the applicant observed for their impressions. PRE-EMPLOYMENT PERSONALITY &amp; INTELLIGENCE TESTS PLUS OTHER ASSESSMENT METHODS HELP YOU HIRE MOTIVATED &amp; PRODUCTIVE EMPLOYEESSince all applicants will tell you, truthfully or not, that they are motivated workers, you need to assess their claims. Use pre-employment tests, job interviews, and realistic job observations. Then, you can make your hiring decisions based on insightful pre-hire assessment methods. COPYRIGHT 2015 MICHAEL MERCER, PH.D.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/css/hire-motivated-employees-using-pre-employment-personality-tests.html"},

Be it ordering food, groceries, clothes or cabs, everything happens in a matter of few clicks. Since our millennial generation has been running on toes to make their ends meet, finding time to socialize and fall in love became tedious. Hence,  and socializing came into action. Online dating apps are somewhat like online shopping. On amazon we judge that bag to our best judgment based on pictures and reviews and on dating apps, we judge the guy based on his bio and good looks. The only difference is that you need to get through the tedious job of swiping and texting to finally go out with someone. But, like every other millennial invention, convenience was sort in this process too (the ‘t’ app was getting dated!). So, smart creative people like us made NO NAMES to make everything a few notches easier. With this meet up/dating app, the days of swiping and texting can be forgotten forever.With No Names, users just post dates based on their preferences of place, date, time and people respond to these posts with date requests. So, No Names managed to make online dating like online shopping after all. Like the picture? Request to go out with him/her then! (add to cart, wink wink!). Oh, the picture reminds me of something. Yeah, you cannot screw this up. A few good pictures are your Aces to landing on a date because that is all you got to impress! That one glance on your post has to be so impressive that she’ll be compelled to send you a request. Now, how do you really nail the pictures? Fear not because we’re right here to help.Here’s how those four pictures should be: -PICTURE #1This will be the first picture that she or he will be laying their eyes on. This one god damn picture determines whether they’re gonna swipe to look at more pictures of yours. So, you have to rock this one. Well, the easiest way to get them to go crazy over your features is to have a picture that highlights them. In that case, nothing can be better than a portrait. Post a portrait picture of yourself with you looking straight into the camera as if you’re looking at them eye to eye. Get that chemistry building even before you get to see them and if they feel that chemistry too, you’re most likely to meet each other.PICTURE #2Now that you have given them butterflies, it’s time to get those butterflies rushing into their hearts and heads. This is where a full picture comes into play. You’ve been giving yourself a hard time avoiding all the chocolate and sugar. So, let that determination pay with you flaunting your hot figure/good shape/abs/amazing any shape confident body to grab more of their attention. A confident pose highlighting all the great parts of you would make the best 2nd picture ever and get them asking for more.PICTURE #3By the time they’ve come this far, they already consider you a great looking person. So, now its time to let them have an insight into your life and your personality. So, nothing can fail a lifestyle picture. Love sipping margheritas? Get yourself clicked while sipping one. Is Bruno (your dog) the most adorable thing in your life? Flaunt your love for each other with a cute picture of you two together! (Ps: - brownie points for a dog because who doesn’t love/want one?)PICTURE #4This is the last picture you’ll be posting of yourself and trust me, you’re just this picture away from a worthwhile date request. You’ve posed enough, flaunted your body and your passions. Now, just ease up and nothing can be as easy going as a selfie with your welcoming smile and a happy face. Get them to see a bit more of the real fun you with this one and have them wanting to know you more than ever.If you follow these instructions like a bible, I’m so sure that you’ll land with great dates and amazing meetups and who knows?

Scars that are left behind after wounds have healed are not going to go away so easily. You have a feeling of inadequacy inside and speak to yourself '' far and few between some midnights. We do not come to terms with feelings of rejection coupled with shame, so easily. Why it is so? Perhaps,'Love is so short, forgetting is so long'. Love is like a game for most people nowadays. They play it with many tricks and maliciousness. Some have fairly in their mind when they will dump you even when they have not even talked to you. They choose their prey wisely. Most of the time their preys are shy, reserved and quiet in nature. It is a cat rat game. There is a prey and a predator. The result is nothing less than complete destruction. In the end you are left with the question 'why he dumped me?' Most of time you do not find an answer. There is nothing so damaging to your overall well-being and mental health than being discarded by someone for no particular reason. The thing is you want explanations and the other person is not willing to provide any. It seems he/she is guided by whims instead of pure reason. You do not know where to go and what to do. You can not see the logic behind it. It would be so easy to handle a breakup if it is supplemented with strong and genuine reasons. You know the intentions of the person and are able to accept his excuse of not being able to move forward together. You can part your ways and know your future destination as well as past history. You do not have to work with unusual complexity. When he has dumped you for no reason you start questioning your own reason. You doubt your own intellect and manners, wondering you might have upset him or caused some trouble for him. While apparently there is none. What you can do with such a situation gets lot more tricky. You want to find answers while he is unwilling to answer. You can not get him to reply to you. You have lost your worth. He has discarded you. There is no solution except acceptance of the fact that he has dumped you once and for all. It is the matter of trust that you should have focused on in the first place. A person who is doing so probably has no remorse. He has no internal anxiety or a feeling of guilt. Proneness to guilt is what keeps people from doing harm to others. You should have trusted one who was prone to feeling guilty instead of getting submitted to someone who has no heart or shame. He probably has enjoyed your condition. Do not give him more material to enjoy. Do not cry before him. Be more strong and stiff than ever. Be stronger but have some amount of flexibility also. If , he will likely do the same afterward.

First and foremost, the best option out there is Netflix Party where both parties need to have a Netflix account first. Following that you can watch movies together. Moving to Facebook Watch Party; it’s a feature on Facebook where multiple people can watch videos together, to access this the video should already be uploaded to Facebook.Last but not least, if you are lazy to do anything, the easiest way would be talking on the phone and hitting the play button together at the same time. Virtual Group WorkoutsIf your date is a fitness freak like you, undoubtedly you love working out together. Whereas all the gyms are closed. You can still carry on your workouts online.Challenge, or motivate each other through the video call and keep track of how is your partner doing. This might sound daunting but still better than working out alone and giving up before you hit the last rep. Without a doubt, your partner can motivate you until the last rep.And if you require your gym trainer you can find many of them online sharing their training tips for free you can follow them easily. Cook and Eat TogetherCraving some good dish, you haven’t dined out since long because of all the restaurants closed due to pandemic. And you miss eating with your beloved.Well, you are in luck, because both things can be fixed in the age of the internet. The recipe of your favorite dish can be found online. Got the recipe now what’s lacking is your partner you can video call and show them what you are cooking, your partner may not be much help, but you can laugh at your cooking mistakes together. Might as well motivate them to cook a dish together that neither of you has made and seeing whose looks more delicious.After cooking together, you can set up the table nicely and eat with our partner eating at the other end at the same time. Digital Board GamesIf you have a board game that you love playing with your date, and you still want to carry-on your board game nights. The simplest option might be to look up for the online or mobile version of it. It’s time to take board game night to the digital sphere. The Android and iOS versions of many board games are easily available. Some of these digital games even allow you to play cross-platform.But if you want to retain the feeling of playing the game in real, you can always play it on a video call. Book Reading together, and discussing how was it after finishing it and exchanging each other’s opinions about it.A pandemic can not take that away from you. Start reading the book together in your own homes, besides now you can easily find many eBooks online. After finishing the book you can discuss with each other about the book and keep this thing going on through this pandemic. Don’t leave me aloneYou might be new to this but many couples already do this in their long-distance relationships. They stay with each other on video calls for longer durations, while working, washing dishes, doing laundry or during any other chores just that they need the presence of the other person with them so they can see and talk to each other, rather than doing the work alone feeling miserable and lonely.You can also adapt this trick during this pandemic, waking up in the morning you miss the presence of your beloved in bed, you can pick up your phone and call them to say good morning or tell them how you dreamt about them.Moving on to breakfast, you don’t like eating alone so you can always have breakfast together on a video call and tell them how your breakfast looks better than theirs.As per routine you can also stay online with them during your house chores, just to feel their presence and tell them how are you doing this wrong and help them out to do it correctly, or maybe they correct you for something.Ending the day with your beloved you can get into bed and then video call them, have a little talk till you sleep.We mustn’t forget about helping singles who are isolated by themselves.

In fact, most young men like mature women.", "word-count": 609, "body": "Age gap relationship is becoming normal now. We can see lots of relationships about older men dating younger women and younger men dating older women. Here are some reasons why most young men like mature women. Why?1. The charming appearance of mature womenWith the development of society, science and technology has brought great changes to life. Many mature women pay attention to their own maintenance, reasonable diet, and healthy nutrition, and they will never be reduced to the point of ‘old age’. On the contrary, they will exude more mature charm, and this charm is often what young men yearn for. So the attractiveness of this kind of mature women is much stronger than that of young women.2. Mature women have a stable careerIn the workplace, women and men have similar places. For example, with the growth of age and rich experience, women in their forties generally have small achievements in their careers. After several years of working life, they have transformed from an immature little girl into a capable female white-collar. For them, they usually have their own clear life plan and can have their own thoughts. And at the same time, some young girls are usually still in the willful period. In addition to thinking about how to dress, they think about how to eat, drink and have fun every day. Then let’s compare mature women with young girls, we will see that men usually like mature women.3. Mature women are financially independentSpeaking of the most realistic problem-money! Perhaps most mature women do not drive luxury cars or live in luxury houses, but one thing is for sure, after so many years of hard work and life, they have formed the habit of self-demand and self-reliance. Mature women have experienced more than young girls. They are independent. You will know that from some . When you are reading the profiles of these women, most of them are single but independent. They know what to do and how to do things. Therefore, everyone is carrying a load, but the gentleness of mature women is like a safe haven. You can let go of all your disguise and move forward hand in hand with them. Mature women have a charm. They will not attach themselves to men and they will actively develop their self-worth. Just like Priscilla and Zuckerberg, Zuckerberg is a billionaire on the Forbes list, but even so, Priscilla has never given up her career dream, contributing her own strength to the world and not being a dependency of Zuckerberg’s career. And let’s see some young girls? Either rely on their young, idle time; or rely on the good conditions of their parents, gnawing old at home. What do you think you would like as a young man?4. Mature women have better mentalityTo be honest, people live in their 30s or 40s, most of them have experienced things. Their mentality is more mature and they are more stable when they encounter problems. Unlike some young girls, who only ask their boyfriends: ‘What should I do?’ Young girls just ask for it. They urgently need company and need you to add even more exhaustion when you are most stressed and helpless. Nowadays, people always find mature women on specific websites or apps. So choosing the  will be a good way to find and date a mature woman.Mature women will accompany you peacefully and quietly. They will forgive your concealment, contribute her strength silently, remove the list from you, and will give you unlimited power of security and comfort.Therefore, to some extent or angle, mature women are more popular with young men, which is inseparable from their own efforts.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/dating-advice/why-do-young-men-prefer-mature-women.html"},

{"heading": "Why do Women Like to Date Older Men?", "author": "Charlie Deen", "description": "For men and women of the same age, women seem to be much more mature than men. This is why normal men like dating women younger than themselves.", "word-count": 830, "body": "Mature men have made some achievements in their career, so they can attract young women easier than young men. Meanwhile, they do not have the impulse when they were young in their feelings, and they have become more tender and considerate. Therefore, it is reasonable for women to like mature men. And there are the main reasons why women like dating older men:1. Mature men know how to take care of womenMature men have experienced several relationships generally. In every relationship, they will sum up their own shortcomings and correct them. There are several women who have taught these men to grow up, so most of the mature men tend to be more considerate to women. All women like warm men, while mature men are not as impulsive as they were young. They are more rational and they can take care of women's emotions. Women like to be spoiled by their own men, and naturally they have no resistance to these men. Good men are like red wine, the longer the age, the better the taste for women.Considerate men tend to think more than younger men. This can make women feel safe, and they don’t have to worry about anything. Mature men will make everything goes well.2. Mature men do things calmly, not impulsively, and not childishTime teaches men not only to be considerate in love, but also how to become more stable in life. In young people's love, a quarrel always becomes to a cold war, while mature men know women's emotions, and they will not do childish things.Compared with young men's personality, older men are more stable and mature. They are very considerate, they will think about the causes and consequences, and then come up with the most appropriate solution to deal with the major and minor matters in life.Mature men will not hesitate as much as they did when they were young, and will be more stable and decisive. Women want their men to have their own opinions. If you need a woman to decide everything, then she will feel that you are not worth it. What a woman needs is a man who can rely on.3. Mature men have a certain financial foundation and can offer women a better lifeMature men have a certain financial strength after hard work, so they can offer women what they want. They will not hesitate for a long time to buy something like young men do. It's not surprising that some women like to date or marry a rich man. Just like the sugar daddy and sugar baby relationships, most of young girls join some  in order to look for some rich sugar daddies to pay their bills. And there is nothing wrong for a woman to find a rich man, because money is the basis of life, and the scope of life is very wide, including food, clothing, housing and transportation. Rich people can live in luxury villas, wear high-end clothes, own luxury cars, and travel around the world at any time. Ordinary people can hardly live such a life. So there is nothing wrong for women to prefer rich men. Being realistic is good for some women.Every woman wants to be the one to be spoiled, and has a boyfriend who can share the sorrow and joy for herself, so a mature man becomes the best choice. Therefore, there are some college girls join  to search for sugar daddies. Mature and steady men have always been the most fascinating poison for girls. So what are the characteristics of mature men?1. Free and easyThey do not treat feelings like children. Mature men know how to face every decision that disappoints them. Even if their girlfriend told them to separate, they will accept it without hurting or harassing their ex-girlfriend, and strive to build their own value.2. Strong sense of responsibilityWhat girls want is a feeling, and this feeling is produced by the temperament of a man. Whether it is emotional responsibility or work responsibility, mature men always maintain full marks.For simple chatting, some boys pester girls to chat every day, which gives girls a feeling of 'you seem to have nothing to do'. But mature men won't reply to messages in seconds, because they are really busy. Girls can feel that such men are serious about their work, which reflects that they are very motivated men.3. Steady and decentWe always meet people who are very steady. No matter what happens, they are very calm and will not let out their emotions casually. For example, when it comes to love problems, boys will be all kinds of anxiety, fear, and even more timid than girls. But mature men will not, they have their own opinions and principles, and they will not easily change their ideas for girls.The expression of this emotion can be seen by girls easily. They will feel very safe even just standing beside this man. This is a kind of steadiness and can be seen from temperament.", "byline": "ArticleFactory", "origin": "http://www.articlesfactory.com/articles/dating-advice/why-do-women-like-to-date-older-men.html"},
